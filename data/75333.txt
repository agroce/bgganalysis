Ein Spiel wie ich es mir wünsche, leichte Regeln und dennoch verhältnismäßig anspruchsvoll.
Der Mix aus Basisaufbau und kooperativem Kampf gegen die Aliens ist für mich einfach perfekt.

Willkommen bei ID4 "Independence Day". (Teil 2?) :-)

Das man das Spiel auch noch semi-kooperativ spielen kann setzt dem Ganzen noch die Krone auf.

RATING: 7
Early impression:

Seems to be a solid but very difficult co-op. The theme is good, though the mechanisms are somewhat superficially connected to what they should represent. The beginning of the game was a little monotonous, but the endgame was very tense.

The game would really benefit from thematic events or any other mechanic that adds more to the narration (e.g. BSG). Same problems like Space Hulk Death Angel in this regard, maybe a little worse.

Artwork is in some parts very good, but this is undermined by the small counters and the boring base/gameboard design. Another thematic flaw: The base floorplan on the player mat (which looks like the one from X-Com - very promising) turns out to be nothing more than a spreadsheet.

While I expect most of my first impression ratings to change, I expect this one to stay by 7 with a slight tendency towards 6.5. But then, maybe the advance game will spice things up.

I should add that I'm generally biased against co-ops.

This coop (or semi-coop in advanced mode) game simulates the alien invasion of planet earth by military and political means. While the game operates on a pretty high and abstract level it's still dripping with theme. You have to build up your abilities through a simple tech tree, keep the edge in influence on the aliens and defend against their military efforts. There is a lot to do and managing and distributing all the duties between the players is a real challenge. All of this is packed into a pretty decent time window of about two hours. Illustrations are really good but component quality is lacking.

I can understand many people would really like this game but, Target Earth is not my cup of tea, it has good ideas but the gameplay is too repetitive and slow also this is not the kind of theme I look for in games.

RATING: 6
Safe the earth from the aliens, very similar to the X-COM computer game of the nineties. Unfortunately only to the strategic part of that game, not the tactical play.
Its ok, + for the theme but rather mechanic plus dice-rolling, but with an OK play time and good coop player interaction.
If i want an excellent game engine to play against, i would choose Pandemic, if it should be a bit heavier  Robinson Crusoe and for a really deep experience i play Arkham Horror. The semi-cooperative mode seems a bit strange to me, if i want a semi-cooperative game i rather play Battlestar Galactica.

RATING: 7
I slightly prefer the semi-coop variant, mixed together with some tiny house rule and some extra bonis, which you must realease during the 7 turns. In invasion stage 1 (Round 1 to 3), do only throw one of your base flags in the nation draw-bag. For what are the allied or the alien Armors? Can you blast them off with a Squad or only broke them with double sixes and an elite Squad or one of your own armor vehicle. Any other suggestions, like some SAM-missle sites?

Solo lo he probado cooperativo, y me convencen las mecánicas y fases. Creo que está todo bien pegado y muy bien pensado.

Sin embargo, los componentes podrían definirse por algunos como "correctos". Es una edición de bajo coste, sin nada de plástico (esto con unos ovnis de plastiquete ganaría horrores).

Target Earth (TE) is a (semi)-cooperative game in which the players fight against an alien invasion. Each round, the players reseach a new technology, advance their base and built units to fight with (jets, infantry and tanks). After that, they will be attacked by an ever growing army of alien ships and troops. Combat is resolved with dice. Rinse and repeat this procedure for seven rounds. Then check if the players managed to get more victory points than the aliens and thus win.

I'm no X-Com fanboy so the theme of this game is kind of wasted on me. The game itself was just okay in my book. I found it too repetitive. Each round you do the same thingd, just the number of alien ships that attack you increases. Since the combat is dice-driven, you can get screwed by bad rolls. That is not something I do mind normally, I do love it in Space Hulk: The Card Game. But in TE, where there aren't that many real decisions, I didn't really like it this kind of combat resolution.

All in all, TE is not really my cup of tea. It's rather light and too repetitive.

Usually not my cup of tea - all the combat-dice-rolling. But this adds a lot of fun via its cooperative structure and decisions. Still need to try the semi-cooperative mode for even more spice.
Don`t think of it of a too much strategical monster, but a fighting fest for friends having a great time.

What a fiddly mess. They should have at least made some better (and bigger!) chits, and a clearer graphical design and give up some of the dark theme instead. Everything looks just too small and too similar.

RATING: 8
The game has a few low lights. The board is difficult to lay flat. The cards, the manual, and the entire game layout could have been better designed, and the game takes a fair amount of set up time (20 minutes plus) but the return is amazing. You get a co-op game where you build a base, research techs, diplomacy, hire troops, tanks, interceptors, carriers, intercept aliens, launch ground missions and defend your bases from alien invasion...with from a game mechanic that allows all that to flow well. 

After a few games, it's not hard to work out a semi optimal strategy, but you have semi co-op for deeper complexity in game and strategy. 

Supports 1 to 4 players in both co-op or semi co-op , plays in about 1 1/2 hours.


This is board game XCOM, and does it near (but no quite) flawlessly...

A really excellent game. It really is very exciting. 
The tension is cranked up on every turn and you are constantly fighting against not having enough resources / trying to decide where to put your efforts. Every choice is a painful one and I love it for it.
If you have the chance to play this one, do yourself a favor and do so.
It does take a while to set up, and the rule book could be better, but man, what a game.

Rulebook is way too complex. The game a bit complex. A nice coöperative game for advanced gamers but the influence of the dice is very great. One bad roll can greatly disrupt the balance of the game

X-Com: The Boardgame indeed. I quite like the system. It's pretty clean when you get down to it, and there's a fair amount of priorities to evaluate.
The diplomacy rolls, however, suck. Almost all of the VPs in the game are doled out by a tiny handful of swingy, nearly unmodifiable high-stakes rolls. That stinks.

First of, I still have to find a coop game that I like. My problem is the mechanic itself.

Target Earth however is the only one I liked in this category. On the other hand, I disliked the huge influence of the dice.

Being an X-Com fan, I have to say that this game is a great conversion of it. There's much pressure in this game, which makes it interesting.

X-Com fans who like dice and have no problem with coop games should definitely get this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Game play is simple enough once you get around the terrible translation of what should be simple rules.

The tokens were difficult to remove from the sprue, which resulted in a few being damaged.

The game is a ripoff of an old favorite PC tile, X-COM:UFO DEFENCE, minus the cool tactical squad combat.

Playing time is closer to 2 hours, but with 10+ games, I'm sure it can be done in 90 minutes.

All in all, it is a risk management game, with a lot of die rolling.  Replay value may appear low to some, as you are always doing the same thing, for 7 turns, which tougher aliens.

It is, unfortunately, rather pricey for what you get.

[Played 4 times]

The "X-com" inspiration is evident (and not bad at all).
The co-op version is a bit too easy (and random) even with the optional variants. 
The competitive version could lead to more interesting situations, but I am afraid that then luck (with dice and cards) would essentially determine the winner.
Overall the interesting choices were few (many decisions felt obvious).
It was nice to try it, but it lacks appeal to be replayed.

Intial rating after one play: 
We had to look up stuff in the rulebook all the time. A good player aid for this game would have been helpfull.

I like the theme and the coop way to deal with the trouble, I think this could be an exciting game. But after a hard session with allmost all of the dice going the wrong direction it looks a bit too much as a luckdriven dicefest with technology-path attached too it. 

Not sure anymore I really want this game. There seems to be better stuff out there to scratch the same itch.

Poor game. 4-player variant is very hard, unplayable because of little money for each player and only one card per turn to use. It is playable for 2 or 3 players (or a solo play in these variants) but there's not much fun. There's also not much cooperation nor decisions to make. What there actually is in that game is dice rolling, a lot of dice rolling. Spending 2 or 3 hours to play this game is a waste of time - it's better to just roll some dices for aliens and then for allies. Compare the results and see who wins.

Played only the cooperative version and this did not thrill me. There aren't many choices and there was never a feeling of impending doom. Maybe the advanced game variant is more interesting but somehow I cannot convince myself to play it again...

RATING: 6
As a tabletop recreation of X-COM, it is a success. As a cooperative game, it is a decent exercise in strategic thinking and risk management, with a well balanced game progression that will keep you on your toes until the very end. An ok coop/semi-coop game for those interested in the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The rulebook is a trainwreck of terrible translation and even worse organization, but once the game is learned and the turns are flowing between the players, this game has a lot to offer. Its pretty dicey, so luck plays a large factor in victory. Not to mention, it seems to be a very difficult game to win in general. I am worried that once a winning strategy is found that it wont have much replay value, but time will tell. Until then, this is a solid cooperative experience.

Seems dry and mathy, where chance calculation takes precedence over anything else. Somewhere along the lines of:
Q: "Where should we allocate resources to?" 

A: Well, of course we need to protect the base. Also, these countries are most valuable so let's focus on that. Any we fail to shoot we fight on the ground and if we shoot all, we fight the missions we're not sending any troops to. Sounds about right?

What I miss in this game: surprises. Secret events. Aliens doing more surprising stuff other as hover a predestined number of UFO's down and telegraphing to anyone 'hey! We will be targeting this next'. I want alien resistance fighters, surpressing governments, presidency kidnapping, countries being leveled, earth living parameters being altered, people being bodysnatched, alien viruses or any other nasty surprising stuff aliens might intentionally or not bring to planet earth.

To me, this seems a mathy exercise set in an X-com universe, without the tension the tactical ground missions brought to the video-game series. Pass.

RATING: 9
Target Earth is a perfect cooperative game, which will bring you to an alternate reality. Its a place, where visitors from space came to our planet. And they were not friendly. There is nothing less at stake in the game, than saving the mankind, just as in its PC acestor. You build bases, send out aircrafts and landing forces to destroy incoming aliens and try to discover new technologies. Game bets everything on cooperation, because all players have most of the time joint finances and forces, yet everyone manages is own base. So everybody has a feeling, that he is part of the resistence. These bases make also another variant possible – a semi-cooperative version of the game. While you are still defending attack from space, you have to simultaneously follow your own goals and try to beat your fellow partners in arms. Not only you, but also aliens are collecting victory points for seized countries, so game can prematurely end in a win or lose. Both types of battles are resolved by dice. Its the only way to defend yourself in face of incoming flying saucers. Processing is excellent and the only flaw is few really tiny tokens. Alltogether, Target Earth is one of the best cooperative games on the market, while it also contains a competitive variant. It definitely deserves more attention, that it gets.

I am a big X-Com fan so this was a "must buy" for me. The theme is extremely well captured, but unfortunately the game itself is disappointing.

Quality of the components is sub-par. Very luck dependent, not much room for mitigation.

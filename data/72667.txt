Very quick and cleverly designed abstract. Object is to create rows of three and four Each move you make limits the possible moves your oponent can make. Nice wood components and it even has a variable playing board. But as with all abstracts, I would very quickly lose interest. Not my cup of tea.

Rather spiffing game mate.. really enjoy playing it. Hoping to play it afew more times with you :)

RATING: 8
Quick and light, it feels very similar to Quarto! in that your move determines, to some extent, your opponent's move (in Quarto! you pick what, in this game, you pick where).

However, I will always pick this over Quarto! because the ending doesn't feel sudden to me. Too often in Quarto! the ending is oops I lost, in this, because the game continues all the way through, it feels more like I got outplayed.

My favourite 2-player abstract game. Ok, I do not play many abstract games but this one beats them all as it's portable (I just carry in my jacket pocket), very easy to play and it's very well made quality makes it easy to get even non-gamers to give it a go (my tagline: it's advanced tic-tac-toe).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, simple, quick abstract game. Described quickly as "Naughts and crosses - but fun".

This game is so simple and easy to learn that I have played this game with groups of friends entirely without saying a single word of explanation in how to play the game. Just start playing the game, the pieces are entirely self explanatory and the game is very powerful and has people umming and arring straight away

Superb "Girlfriend Game" it's one of our main staple games now.

Caution: this game can be "grokked" after about 20 plays, but for the elegance and simplicity of this game, it is still very highly recommended.

Picked up at UK Games Expo 2015

An interesting variation on the old noughts & crosses which brings a higher level of strategy to the game. This game is also available on the Google Play Store for Android based devices.

RATING: 4
An inoffensive and small abstract game. Nothing spectacular here, but fun to while away a short pause with. Would probably work best as a Clemens Gerhards production so that it becomes a good showpiece too; the current multiplex with laser-burnt symbols looks and feels very cheap. 1 point deduction because of this. Competitor Quarto! does more or less the same as Mijnlieff, but has the benefit of being able to be put out in the open without ridicule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
The rules are very clever, but they don't add up to quite as much game as I'd hoped. I realize it's a light game by nature (feather light), but most of the choices I make during a game either feel arbitrary or obvious.  Still, fun enough for what it is.

RATING: 9
Wonderful little abstract, where players alternate placing their piece on a 4x4 grid.  A player's piece restricts where the next player may place their piece - on a diagonal or orthogonal line, or adjacent or distant from the piece just played.  Very simple, but clever at the same time.  A game takes about three minutes, then you go again.  Brilliant little game.

A very lovely little 2 player abstract game that is kind of like tic tac toe [squared]. I own both the Android version and the physical laser cut wood version. The app mimics the real life version very well and it's fun to play against the Viking AIs even if they make silly moves sometimes. It's good for players new to the game to use the app to get familiar with legal moves and then play in person. The real life version is simple and beautiful. The game is quick to setup and play (a game from setup to end could be 5 mins) and does not take up a lot of play space. I would recommend it for restaurants, bars, pubs, camping and plane/train trips as a highly portable quicky but deep, and not too thinky abstract.

An excellent 2 player strategy game that can be played in about 10 mins. I know its a home made game, but a big version with nicer components might capture more of an audience (then again, maybe it wouldn't). I recommend you at least play it to try it, it's not much of a time expenditure and the rules can be learned in a few minutes.

Mijnlieff is certainly one of those abstracts where you think, "why didn't I think of that?" when you first play it. A very easy, intuitive set of rules and immediately an intriguing game.  That being said, I find the depth rather minimal. It isn't as baseline as tic-tac-toe (which is seemingly the foundation for this game), but after the first half of the game the turns become rather scripted.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as deciding which pieces to place initially is what really counts and where the most interesting part of the game lies.  But other than that, I don't know if replayability would be very high for me, even with the modular board (which was a smart idea to include).  So to conclude, a great idea for a game, a nice time-passer, but not a game I'd want to play too many rounds of.

Played the free Android version only and I like it very much. It's a small, easy, fast, cheap and yet a fairly deep abstract strategy game.

Even though this isn't as deep and long as Yinsh for example, this one can hold up against the Gipf series which is very positive!

Curious Abstract game played on a 4x4 board. The tile you play determines where your opponent can/must play, and vice versa. You win by having the most sets of 3 in a row (similar to noughts and crosses).

There are 4 types:
On a line like a Rook
On a line like a Bishop
Adjacent (diagonally or orthogonally)
Not Adjacent

Not really my cup of tea though.

Mijnlieff gets into tactical ruts.  I created an expansion to deepen the game, called Mijntrree.  Check the Milnlieff forum to see the expansion set.

RATING: 3
Very dry and unexciting. Too short to develop any sort of flow, so strategy will be entirely determined by the first 2-3 moves. This turns it into more of a puzzle than a real game, with interest not brought in by the other player but by the varying board configuration. I suspect that between players who have played a dozen times each most of the time will be spent thinking about the empty board, then playing through.

This British game of Hopwood Games has a remarkable Dutch sounding name and it comes in a beautiful fabric bag containing nice wooden parts only. You try to get three of your pieces in a row for a point a la Tic-Tac-Toe. The piece the player just placed also indicates where the other player can and cannot place his stone.

This is a pretty fun abstract game for two with simple rules, depth and it also has a modular board! Recommended!

It's like Connect 4 and Noughts & Crosses had a smarter baby.

The main difference is that, in Mijnlieff, your choice of piece to put down also affects where your opponent can put their next piece. So you can box them in.

RATING: 8.67
Tão, mas tão simples e, ao mesmo tempo tão, mas tão interessante… Um jogo que parece básico e que está longe de o ser, em especial devido ao tabuleiro modular e à surpreendente versatilidade que a pouca variedade de tiles (4) proporciona. Como se joga num minuto, é um jogo a que qualquer boardgamer não pode ficar indiferente…

Nice short abstract strategy game where your move restricts where the opponent's next move must be, in the vein of Synapse Ice and Coffee. Nice hand-made wooden bits. The ability to arrange the 4 board quadrants arbitrarily, not just as a big square, during setup gives good variety.

Really like playing this simple well thought through 2 player game, it makes a great travel game and it doesn't take long to pick up the rules. I like how you can change the four pieces of the board around to change the dimension of the game. My only problem is my teenagers seem to be able to beat me most of the time. Definitely pleased with my purchase which was not expensive at under a tenner.

I do not usually write comments on games or rate them  especially ones I have an active interest in.  As i do not feel it is fair but I just feel I have to for this game.

So to be up front I spent a lot of 2010 Essen demoing this game and pushing in front of people.

I was first introduced to this game at Expo and am lucky enough to have one of the first 25 copies.

It is a great game that I was teaching and having a game in about 5 mins.  Most of the people that I had to encourage to sit down played more than one game and a lot went on to buy the game.  I even had one of the press come up to me and thank for for being so pushy on the last day of Essen.

After doing over 120 demos you would have thought I would be board by this game far from it. I still love the game and will play it any time someone wants a game.
For me that is a very strong recommendation as I tend to play a game once then put it away as I have far too many games I have not played yet.

Juego de estrategia japonés, casi abstracto, donde mueves tu Daimyo, señor feudal y fichas de ejercitos, a través de un tablero de exágonos móviles, y los movientos y acciones se hacen con 2 cartas, que luego van a las manos de tus enemigos xD Es bastante curioso, y hace pensar.

It's an abstract, "troop" movement game. It doesn't have mass appeal, but looks very interesting. For now, I don't have a reason to get this.

This is really an abstract game, but it is an interesting one.  Game play is aimed at defeating another general.  Played as a 2 player game, the special action cards and the leaders may be overly powerful in some combinations.  In 2, 3 or 4 player games, play favors a mass army approach, so either strike early or be sure to create choke points for defenses and slow down the advancing army with sacrificed scouts.  Manipulating the land is a key tactic and one of the factors that makes the game feel abstract.  The game may actually shine with 3 players or with 4 player in 2 teams.

Outstanding components - specifically the player's general - make this a visually appealing game as well.

Annoying abstract wargame. It starts out looking interesting and captivating, and then the card swapping mechanism kicks in. Cards you use end up in the hands of other players, meaning that the game very effectively balances itself and prevents anyone from building up impenetrable positions. Okay, I can deal with that. What I cannot deal is the fact that you only get two actions per turn and that it therefore takes forever to get to another daimyo with an interesting amount of bushi. And that is discounting special effect cards which throw wrenches into the gears. Keep in mind that in the two-player game you must walk, oh, 4 hexes or so...??! And  with multiple players the 1:1-combat opens up the game to very nasty trench warfare problems which appear in Antike too: two dogs are fighting for the bone and the third swoops in for the kill.

Honestly, do yourself a favour: get Hive instead if you're with two players (2 de Mayo if you're into a wargame that's fast and workable), play something else when with more players, and leave this turd on the shelves of your FLGS or FOGS.

First play was a two-player game with my son.  We both liked it, but agreed that it would probably be better with another person or two.  Subsequent plays were also two-player games.  Will hold off on rating it until have played with three or four.

Synthetic in both rules and graphics, it is enjoyable to play and strategically stimulating; in two players does not express all its potential.

RATING: 6
We only played the basic game, but we had two goes at it because it ended so quickly (in defeat for me! TWICE!). Maybe the advanced game is worth it, but the basic game really didn't impress us. The way the cards pass to your neighbours is interesting, but the actual game play and result is quite poor. We were surprised that the rules were so long for such a basic game. I'll have to try the advanced version but at the moment I would not recommend this.

RATING: 9
It's a really good abstract game. I like the materials, I like the system, I like the "theme" and I like even the adaptability of the "gameboard". It's completely randomless, and this helps in my voting. It's simple, it's easy to play, but it's still a really strategic game.
Great!

RATING: 7
Well, this is a very subtle game. Unique card management with modular board. It deserves more plays.
Anyway, it's outstanding how important is every single move. Usually if you could play a third card you will be able to win. It's tense even after few turns, thanks also at his little map. Pay attention of your move.  Pay attention of the weak player's one. No time to rest.

RATING: 3
Somewhat interesting Japanese themed abstract game. I know some folks who would really enjoy this. It's simple, easy to learn, & beginner friendly. The card actions keep things balanced, as they are passed around (everyone gets a chance at using them). My only problem with the game is that it can be very back and forth.

This is a very abstract game. I can see that the game 'works', but unfortunately I get creamed every single time I play. This game will probably please the Gipf-lovers (although it might be too 'easy' for those). The mechanic where you keep passing around cards thet were played is a very, very clever find.

RATING: 8
This is a very cool and unique (abstract) game that noone knows about, sadly!

I've to play a few more rounds with and without the special cards, but the games I've played were great. Also, all my games have been 2 player.

The only problem I see are the special cards, but you can play without them or show them to everyone before the game starts (no suprises anymore). It's not like they kill the game, but they can end it abruptly unless you show them at start.

However, there's one card that seems to be broken - the Ronin one. Normally the cards balance themselves out, as your opponent will get the cards once you used them, but in this case, you put only as many Ronin into play, as there are available. This means the following:

Player A plays the card and puts 3 Ronin into play (there are only 3). Now, when player B gets the card, he can't use it as he is only allowed to put Ronin into play that come from outside of the game! So he has to kill the others before he can use it and that's like game over, as this costs 3 turns to break even, while player A can do other things like attacking.

Away from this, this is definitely an unknown gem.

Abstract game about war.  There are some interesting parts about the game in that you reshape the battlefield to try and suit your needs.I played a couple of 4 player games, and I'm not sure I get it.  Very cool looking, very customizable (we played the most vanilla of the games)

RATING: 6
Very elegant game, a bit on the abstract side. I prefer to play the "basic" game with no additional cards, but it's a good thing you can play DAIMYO on different levels (more strategy or more luck).
Two thumbs up for the aspect: all the illustrations are very nice, and the Daimyo bits are so wonderful you have to see them.

A really good abstract game, nice both in 2 and more players. The systme offer (both with basic and advanced rules) a lot of strategies and every game i different. I still don't know if playing many games it could be repetitive, but I think not since the game is gone along a very long playtesting (more than 2 years). With basic rules the game is more trategic and chess-like, tha advanced rules make it more close to stabdard boardgames.

Lightish abstract wargaming. It plays in 20 minutes and the more advanced cards are incorporated easily. There are some interesting bluffs and feints you can make and turtling will not save you.

I'm pleasantly surprised and this one stays in the collection after a long time without a initial play. I'm sure many wouldn't care for this based on it's serious abstract nature alone.

Picked Up June 2006

Ordered from BGG User buergerberatung. Crazy shipping cost.

Beautiful graphic design. The game can be compacted into a much smaller container, meaning extra portability, except for the rulebook.

I translated the available Spanish rules back to English so as to be able to print them in a compact format.

OMG! This game is great! Simple, elegant rules, mechanics and pieces. And there are plenty of tough choices.  This scratches that certain wargamery itch better than Vinci for me. I really like the tension added by the optional cards.

Does suffer from problems with army escalation and players not wanting to be the first to commit to a battle for fear of weakening themselves too much.

2016 Update
About a decade since my last play, I managed to get this to the table, after being reminded of it by the game Inis. Probably need to bring my rating down a bit to a 7-7.5. I still like it and we need to get more plays in, but I think the multi-player balance issues are still a concern.

Abstract. 
Simple rules (but the "variant" introduces 16 extra cards, all different, that you should know to play properly).
Interesting gameplay.
There are two victory conditions (one based on pieces and the other on controlled zones).
I would like to play again to see how it plays with experienced players and if it is too repetitive or not.

Not sure about this one yet ... Played our first game last night and while there are some really nice mechanics (card priorities, giving away cars you use, movement of hans) and the production value is very nice, the endgame seemed to drag on.

Everyone wanted to like it but with 3 players it seemed to stalemate for about 20 to 30 minutes until the inevitable quick ending.

Perhaps the Advanced Rules, Mastery Cards & Special Action Cards will save this from the depths of mediocrity.

Minimal pasted on theme, the game is more geometric than Oriental.  The few plays I've tried were very frustrating when another player won while I was unable to do anything to stop it while a third player passed up his responsibility to prevent defeat for everybody. Bits are nice, I might try again if anyone shows interest, might not.

With two players, this game ended it a situation where either of us could only win if the other made a mistake. We were pretty sharp that evening, so we quit after playing for more than two hours. I should have known better knowing that this game is from the hands of the same designer as the awful "Krumble!". Are his games playtested at all? Avoid if you like any excitement in your games.
UPDATE: Piero contacted me after reading this comment, and explained that the published game differs from the one he designed. I am still interested in playing his original design some day! Hopefully, next time Piero will find a publisher who takes more care in preserving his designs.

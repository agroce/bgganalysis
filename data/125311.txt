For a game that can be taught in 1 minute, has a 15 second setup time, and takes up no more space than a large napkin, this game is flawless.  Play it almost every time I go out to eat.

RATING: 8
Tic-tac-toe on steroids, and totally fun! The top-notch quality of components-- thick tiles and heavy, uniquely illustrated family member discs-- take it up a level. Very easy to teach and play in a quick fashion. Great for plane trips or even while waiting for food at a restaurant. Overplaying it can make it a little boring, so keep it in bursts. If it had just one more layer of complexity-- say, cards that allowed you to shuffle the rows and columns or a larger grid of columns-- it'd be perfect.

Positives
- Excellent component quality and design-- nice tin with quality packaging, thick tiles and lovely family member discs
- Simple with just enough complexity to allow some light strategy
- Plays fast

Negatives
- Can suffer if overplayed

for an easier to decipher good time, you can recreate this game with 16 playing cards (A-4 of each suit) and some poker chips, but lets give some credit to the actual game design. you can teach this game to a newbie and play through an entire game in 5 minutes. superb filler/abstract.

RATING: 7
Nice little game that is a bit like a travel man's version of Kamisado.  Each play forces your opponent to play onto a specific type of tile.  Since each tile has 2 such, there are usually multiple places to play.  But the trick is to get them lined up in a 4x1 or a 2x2 arrangement - while preventing the same for your opponent.  Game plays quite fast and is excellently made - although I do wish the tile had been the same Bakelite material as the markers.  Solid little game and a good addition to any game library.

Nice abstract. Plays quick.
You can plan rounds ahead.

CON:
- First player has an advantage.

Dóri:
Fast, easy abstract game, also ideal for travelling because the box is very small. I like the rules, especially that the players can influence each other moves. Only  bad thing that the player who moves first has a huge advantage.

So light that it soon drifts away into nothingness with the winds.

Very Quick sort of micro game. Plays like connect four or squares connect the dots. Had lots of end games whereas no one wins but one is block. So the loss goes to the player that got blocked. It's ok for a quick travel game. Great components can't complain about the price.

A tiny, lovely "Connect 4" type game. The clunky "Checkers" are heavy and feel good to hold, and the tiles are thick, and double sided with lovely artwork. The game comes in a tin and usually tins are a pain, but not for a game this size. Toss it into your backpack on the way out to the shops or a quick game between classes.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting take on 4 in a row mechanics with a twist of attribute matching. Play resulted in a lot of ties after everyone got the hang of it, allowing them to mostly outcome being trapped, however occasionally the board was to hard to overcome and games could end with as many as 7 tiles still on the board with seemingly close to optimal play. Seems like it would make for some interesting computer simulations, however only worth a couple of plays before it gets repetitive. Good quick game with solid components and neat tile art, however the faces on the chips seemed a bit odd, I would have loved more abstract art or no art at all.

About as good as a game this simple can be -- programming a computer to play perfectly would probably only take an afternoon (and be its own kind of fun) but it's a 2-minute abstract with nice chunky pieces that demands a combination of intuition and look-ahead. Well done.

Now, if only the tiles had been single-sided so they were easier to randomize without seeing what's going where.

Neat little filler built on the tic-tac-toe mechanics (but with that Bruno Cathala trademark twist: setting up the requirements for your opponents' moves, while lowering the available combos with every turn, and thus building up for a very intense endgame). Elegant artwork. Although my version (1st International) doesn't have those neat thick plastic player tokens (just punchout cardboard tokens).

Can't think of a way they could have improved this game.

It has a great aesthetic, which is exactly what I want an abstract strategy game to have (since they can't really have theme).

The strategy is very deep for how short this game is!  It's perfect information and there's a maximum of 16 moves in a game.  But at the same time, I never have the problem of people taking too long on your moves.  Really rare to find in a strategy game.

Wife loves it, I love it, everyone's happy.  Even the tin is neat.  I'm starting to really love Blue Orange.  Great quality components combined with solid strategy but done in a cute package...I really like this combo.  And not very expensive at all; I got this for $13.  Super portable also.

Gamer's Tic Tac Toe.  On a 4x4 grid, you select a tile where you place your color and then the opponent must place based on the background items that appear on the tile.  If you can form 4 in a row or a 2x2 square, you win.  The game is likely solvable, but it is a nice two player game that is a good filler.

Tic-tac-toe with teeth meets Connect Four with depth. I dig it. Super-portable, too, and while I'm not a fan of tins over boxes, Blue Orange did a great job with the components; the pieces are lovely.

Lightning-quick to learn and play. Even in just three games, we started seeing more depth each time. I can see how after 10 games, let's say, it could become a game of "who makes the first mistake" (which I like). And whatever happens, 5 minutes later it's over and you can play again.

(Niya) A quick two-player game that you can play with anybody.  You can teach this game in 2 minutes or less.  It's tactical tic-tac-toe on a 4X4 grid, and not a 3X3 grid.  A perfect light, filler.  And it has tiles!

Can't wait to try this with the wife...I think she'll appreciate the simplicity.

Niya is based on the concept of 4-in-a-row; however, the key to winning is to recognize that even if you can't make 4-in-a-row, you can still win by leaving your opponent with no legal plays.

The game components are classy and games play in 10-12 minutes each, meaning you can easily have this as a post-dinner game. This game plays 2 players only.

A pretty game that can be easily solved.  Stalemate prone.

Play quickly and have it random (but mostly stalemate) or thoughtfully and have it solvable (but mostly stalemate).  Your choice of boring options.

Fun quick filler game. You always need to be playing 2-3 steps ahead which could cause some ap issues.  None the less, still a quick fun game with some depth.

Good game, gorgeous Japanese-themed art on the cardstock tiles.

The multiple victory conditions work nicely.

The "lose if you can't move" makes it feel perhaps like one of those where the opening is somewhat opaque but near the end you can read ahead with certainty to see "Player X will win". But there is actually some clear strategy as well early on due to the 4x4 grid spatial positioning with threats to make a square or line!

Short gameplay, simple easy rules.

It is decent for what it is.  In Niya players playtokens out on the table in place of pictured tiles to get four in a row or a square much like connect four.  However players can only play in a location that has the same items on the tile that was previously placed by the other player.

Pros: simple rules . Beautiful art and components fast game play

Cons:no deep thinking. No really deep theme

Light game that plays very quick (like, 10min), so that it's probably best to play a series, or I guess while you're waiting for others to finish whatever they're doing. It's basically 4x4 tic-tac-toe with some restrictions on where you can play. The components, as well as the tin it comes in, are nice.

So... another game about prostitution, but this time its ok, because its Asian, Japanese even, and because the whole geisha thing is so aesthetical and all that? For what basically is an abstract, someting else - lets say ikebana flower art or the like - would have been a better choice.

RATING: 4
I don't really understand the huge appeal of this. It's definitely pretty, but that's about it. I don't think there's too much strategy in it, and while you can shoehorn your opponent based upon which tile you select, I think that it generally favors the starting player, much like old-fashioned tic-tac-toe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
this is a beautiful, quick game like connect 4 with gorgeous art and weighty components. There is something both simultaneously relaxing and stressful about this game. I'm unsure how much tile arrangement and early token placement determines who the winner is, vs tactical game play... but no matter, it is enjoyable and lovely for the price. It's also highly portable and easy to teach so makes a nice addition for throwing in a bag for spontaneous play.

A neat little quick-playing abstract, with fantastic production. True, the tin box is no longer in style, but the tiles are nice and thick and well-illustrated, and the player pieces feel great in your hands (that domino type material) and also have nice little portraits. It's a four-in-a-row style game, with forced moves like in Kamisado. Cool game!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The 16 tiles show every combination of 4 poetry symbols (rising sun, poem flag, bird, rain cloud) and 4 plants (maples, cherry tree, pine tree, iris). Shuffle and place in a random 4x4 grid. 

The first player replaces one of the outside tiles with one of their tokens. Then alternate turns replacing a tile which shares a type (plant or symbol) with the last tile placed with one of your pieces. 

The first player to get 4 in a line (row, column, or diagonal) or in a 2x2 grid, or take away the other player's legal moves, wins!

Okiya feels as though it should be solveable and to take a turn without working it out feels like playing suboptimally. Of course, early on there is too much to calculate and so you're playing tactically until such time as you can start to work out all of the permutations available.

Sadly the result for me is that this feels quite frustrating rather than fun.

The production quality is lovely though.

This is Kamon's little brother. A 4x4 grid with Kamon style two-way restrictions on placement that get very tight towards the end of the game, with interesting parity effects. Lovely artwork.

I actually prefer Kamon, but for the time taken to play, this is a great small game.

This game is elegant.

It's simple to learn but hard to perfect.

It's amazing how the end of the game can occasionally sneak up on you, but after awhile you'll more likely be playing for points than just to win a match.

It does exactly what it's designed to do.

There is no real theme, though. This is a straight abstract, a very good one.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy of this game from the company.

Dude, if you want me to try your game,  don't begin a sentence with, "This is just like Connect Four!"

[i]Niya[/i] is a light diversion with pretty illustrations, though the winner seems to be determined halfway through.  And possibly after the very first move.

I'm probably not the best player to review very abstract games since I tend to not like them.

This a pretty simple abstract game.  The artwork appears to be very nice.  It's good when a game company puts effort in presentation.

As another viewer pointed out, this a light game.  Without using a program to number crunch, there might be some repeatability in play.  The simplicity should allow for short games.

So there are a number of gateway games that allow newer players to get used to certain game concepts and tactics that they can take to other games or get deeper in the same game.  Being a light game, not sure how much soft skills can work to make game more strategic.  I suspect this might be a good gateway for other abstract games like those from the Gipf project.

Beautiful components in a nice package that make this simple game a pleasurable diversion. The game is an interesting exercise in forward planning with narrowing decision paths. The game can bog down if you try to plan too far ahead fearing to trap yourself in a dead end of binary choices. I usually lose at this game a la Vizzini.

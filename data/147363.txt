The worst DM Starter pack in all of Dice Masters. It was a rip off at the time and it still is today. That being said, the basic actions are still useful!

RATING: 8
For a game that boils down to: draw random dice from a bag and roll them for random results against an opponent doing the same thing, it's ridiculously fun. The drafting component really makes this game shine. Knowing what your opponent has chosen and taking something to answer it helps tremendously. Even when the dice come up to a face you didn't want, you get something. It can be pretty frustrating if the half of the best monster you own with its summon faces never comes up in a game but you can at least make up for it by drafting cheaper dice in the meantime. Even if you don't see your best stuff early out of the bag, you know they'll be coming late and ultimately all of your dice are used every time through your bag. This is a game I feel is very excellent and would play constantly if I owned a copy.

Got this with part of an online order to make up for the delay in shipping. Had no interest in the game so gave it to a coworker so that his kids could play it as they were more interested in it than we were.

I'm not a Yu-Gi-Oh! guy in general, but picked up this starter set and several packs for the combos and variation I can apply with other Dice Masters properties. And the set isn't all that bad.

Dice Masters is a great game. Ultimately, I'm certain that this version is just as good as any. The problem I have with it is the horrible screen capture images used on the cards. The artwork is lazy at best. These are not even good screen captures.

Counting this as played because it's virtually the same game as Uncanny X-Men but with a different theme.

Not at all fond of the artwork.

A good way to learn the game, needs more extra foil packs to add enough variety to the base game.

Minor improvements to gameplay, but less variety than the 2 previous starter sets.

RATING: 7
Purchased the Starter for any new Basic Actions that might have been added. Disappointing set, but its Yu-Gi-Oh! and about what I expected. Stick to the Super Heroes and DnD Dicemasters, which are possibly the best two player duel style games released in a decade.

RATING: 6
See Uncanny X-Men for my main thoughts.  This set is annoying because there is only one rarity level per character in the starter.

A popular CCG meets the CDG.

Pros:
+ New low cost cards

Cons:
- serial numbers on dice
- many cards and dice are rare and ultra rare only
- confusing abilities

Rather bad card quality

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

I'd rather play [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123607/puzzle-strike-third-edition]Puzzle Strike[/url]

Fun to play but the art on the cards is just low res shots from the show which detracts a bit from the game. It's an okay set with a couple of staples for the serious collectors.

starter set + full gravity feed, so nearly a full set of dice, commons and uncommons, about half the rares. can supply a full list if needed.

Love the idea of this!! Have played a few times only with the starter box, hoping to pick up some boosters and play quite a bit more.

Update - With more plays this keeps growing on me! Really neat game. Reminds me of a deck buildy Magic.

It's really fun and the abilities of monsters are interesting and make since for the monsters to have (given what they do in the show and TCG). The dice look great, better than the avengers vs. x-xmen in print quality it looks like. My only complaint would be the number of cards the base set comes with but that's not really a big deal to me.

I still love the system, and some of these cards work well in an unlimited format. However, I really dislike the idea of serialized dice.

When I was younger I played yugioh and with my first job being at McDonalds in a walmart, I spent many of my lunch breaks buying booster packs to strengthen my decks.  Over the years I lost touch with YUGIOH since some of the rules got crazy and it was a money sucker.  when I saw the YUGIOH dice masters I decided to take a chance with the IP, and it definitely gave me the feeling of playing traditional YUGIOH and the dice master engine is awesome.  I wish they would add more sets!

Surprised me. I have no affinity for nor knowledge of Yu-Gi-Oh, but the mechanisms that they introduced in this set are really pretty cool.

Enjoyable. Usually quick. Kinda addicting at times. Love creating all sorts of teams. And I love. Those. Dice! :)

Besides its collective aspect, it does have two major issues:
1) The rules are simply not clear enough, especially when it comes to things like timing, sidekick/character distinction, retaliation, etc. I've had so many instances in which me and my opponent had no idea how to deal with the situation. 
2) A problem that many 1-on-1 card combat games have: games can slow down to sluggish stalemates. Both players just build up defenses each turn, because you are extremely vulnerable afterward if you attack. There should be more incentive for attacking, or less power for the defense.

This game has ALOT of problems, the greatest being that it is just a set in Dice Masters, and will more than likely never get new cards and dice. 
The system as a whole should be one I have as it is heavily reliant on chance, and easy to cheat in. Fortunately I don't care about the "competitive" game, (because I can't run full yugioh dice in it and that's the only theam that fits this dice throwing grab bag of fun) so cheating doesn't matter to me.
I love drafting dice and rolling them at my opponent until one of us losses, and then doing it again. The super quick nature of the game means there are never hurt feelings. 
Side note: the components are garbage the cards are all basically copy paper, the rule book IS copy paper, you get orogomie bags, and the dice are all slightly deformed from the custome indentation presses.
But for 10 bucks this has given me hours of fun, that can't be said about to many games that I know of.

Disappointed that this starter only comes with 8 character cards (1 version each, instead of 3 versions of each dice).
Also really not a fan of the still-shots taken directly from the TV show (they all look blurry).

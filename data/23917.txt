Solid Area game of the 1864 campaign of ACW in the East. Inspiring Craig Grando map and counters.

RATING: 9
Initial rating.  It may go up to 10 with more plays.  This is an innovative take on the area-impulse games by one of the top designers in the business.
I love the combat system.  The entrenching rules are great.  The replacement point system and especially the daylight mechanism that ends each turn on a variable unknown impulse.  WOW.
As far as gameplay, it is extremely challenging for both sides.  The rebs have to watch the flanking and make due with a small force.  The Yanks are racing the clock and fighting through a bloody meatgrinder and trying to outmaneuver.  Loads of fun and challenge!

As a late comer, I found NWBM to be an intense package that packs a lot of punch in the span of an afternoon. For me, this is very much a desirable + factor. Such brevity is certainly a feature I've come to appreciate about Mike Rinella's fine games. Having had possession of this game for years, I find I did myself a considerable dis-service for not examining such a fine ACW title. My bad for not checking it out sooner.

The situation starts with RE Lee's brilliant "Inverted V" defense position established at the Ox Ford (N. Anna river). Being a long-time veteran of the Gamers excellent CWB series, I found it rather refreshing that we could actually resolve Lee's intended "trap" in the course of an hour or so. Here, we are spared the 8 to 16 hr commitment dedicated to play of CWB's 'Strike Them A Blow!'  

I would love to try this via PBeM opponent. I'm familiar with its VASSAL program.

An enjoyable game.  The large map, low counter density and the difficulty and riskiness of mounting assaults make this a game of manoeuvre.  That suits me fine.  The system also emphasises the importance of command; the Confederates really miss Lee on a day when he is ill.

Each turn gives both sides plenty of food for thought.  The game is essentially about whether the Confederates can mount an orderly - and not too rapid - retreat to Richmond without getting outflanked and suffering heavy losses. The uncertain turn length makes both sides think hard about priorities. 

The rules seem comprehensive, though they aren't an easy read.  I find the map and counters both pleasing to the eye, though, as others have commented, the boundaries of irregularly-shaped areas might have been easier to see.

First of all something is wrong with the title.

Second I don't believe the [gameid=730] system was the right one to simulate this campaign. And I do miss the rerolls with the advantage.

But in my game I have seen the different stages of the Cold Harbour battle:
North Anna - Union flank move - Confederate retreat - Siege of Richmond.

RATING: N/A
A very good application of the "Storm Over Arnhem" system.  Good map graphics, still clearly a Craig Grando product but clear, well-blended and not jarring as were some of his experimental creative efforts in earlier ATO games.  Re-creates the desperation of ANV's holding actions and AoP's almost-but-not-quite breakthrough effort.

RATING: 8
An excellent Game. The situation is fairly well balanced but tense for both sides. I would say the game is easier to play as the Union but is by no means a push over.

I did think that the compnents were slightly sub Par. The colors used on the counters to differientate different corps were too similar but still functional. However, the mapboard (although pleasing to look at) is not very functional. It is VERY difficult in some areas to distinguish between different areas..

I would reccomend this game. It's fun, quick and easy.

Great ATO magazine game focused on Cold Harbour during the American Civil War. The design works really well and the experience is quite chess like. All games ended in Union victories of varying degrees, but only one resulted in significant, unrecoverable casualties, convincing Robert E Lee that the end had come.

The fact that this Michael Rinella game is coming up is the sole reason I haven't canceled my ATO subscription. Check that, I have. But I'll buy this issue off the shelf. Interestingly the "Not War But Murder" description was not originally "coined" for Cold Harbor, but actually an earlier battle. This same title was used for a recent book on Cold Harbor, in which the author advertised his Confederate credentials on the dust jacket ... not a good sign. It'll be interesting to see if ATO can make a hash of this game too.

3 plays 2 player
5 plays solo

This title was my first foray into the Area-Impulse family.  If this game is indicative of the tension, mechanics, and replayability of its siblings ... it's a fine family.  There's a fair amount of maneuver and counter maneuver in this game which is a good thing in my book.  In my experience it has the most maneuver of any Area/Impulse game.  

I find it plays well solo too, within the confines of solo gaming of course.  The question of when the day will end helps the solo play quite a bit as does Lee's health.  One drawback is the Igo-Ugo nature allows players to counter every move their opponent makes, very traditional, and nothing like the actual campaign.  Of course, use of the advantage helps counter act this to a degree allowing the occasional whammy/surprise.

Both sides face challenges and have options for overcoming them.  The CRT-less Assault method quickly becomes second nature, is very thematic, and works well.

As I say, this is a really good game, and an affordable introduction to a system that's highly regarded.

If you're looking for a gateway to the genre, another member for your collection, or simply a really good ACW game, give this title a serious look.

Final note, repeated play has raised my rating.

Excellent game - by far the best of any ATO offering yet (as a game, at least). One complaint I have about area-impulse games is that one side seems to never have much to do - that is not the case here. Both the CSA and Union have too many choices and not enough time to get to them! Always the sign of a great game.

Initial impressions after a couple plays are positive. There are some interesting differences between this and other area impulse games owing to the way corps move plus the overall commander. The advantage marker doesn't allow for re-rolls, but it does give you other abilities that you must use wisely.

Some players seem to feel that the Confederate player is too weak. To them I would say that you must play with the Advanced rules in order for the game to have any semblance of balance. The advanced rules slow down artillery, add rain and add the ability to destroy bridges. Each of these are mostly going to benefit the Confederates. Without them, I think the Union will roll up the rebels like a carpet.

If you're still having a difficult time, add in the leader insubordination rules and/or the Meade-Grant feud, though the latter might make the game very unfun for the Union player if the die rolls go badly too often.

I really like this game.  It took me about 3 tries to really get it for some reason.  I like that it uses the same mechanic as other area-impulse games, reducing how many rules that I have to learn.  I like that the rules (once understood!) manage to convey some important historical lessons without too much rules overhead.  For example, cavalry screening is easily modeled (cavalry retreats if infantry enters same area; the effect of the screen results from the fact that entering any occupied area is a high cost endeavor.  Or, attack without reserves and risk a devastating counter-attack: a failed attacked leaves the attackers exhausted, and exhausted troops contribute little to nothing on defense!  I found the activation rules a little confusing, and found the size of the game/map detracted a bit from it relative to two other games by the same author: Ie Shima and Operation Battleaxe.  In those smaller games, EVERY move felt critical and tension was high; in Not War But Murder there are more options but I feel like less tension.  Similar problem with Breakthrough Cambrai for me.  I LOVE the system but feel it works best in small packages, and I'm excited to see that Mike Rinella seems to be targeting these smaller games now.

With a little cleaner rules, this game would be a 9.  Good balance, interesting options for both sides, replayable, combat results feature just the right amount of variety and chance.  Fun options for cav on both sides, including the chance (albeit unlikely) to go for the homerun with the Union Cav.  Sheridan's cav was slightly superior to the late-war confederate cav, and this is well-modeled in the game.

A strong operational treatment of Cold Harbor that is easy once you get beyond the awful rulebook and subpar map. The game encourages maneuver, but this can be difficult given the generally limited map space and the fact that the opponent is always allowed to react after any of your moves. I enjoy this although it won't work if applied to other battles. I like how battle is handled, since it allows large attacks to work, but if they fail then it is pandemonium. I would like to see some leaders be better than others as opposed to each being rather generic. Overall Rinella has done the impossible; he has made an interesting Cold Harbor game, but not one I would play very often..

I like this system a lot...And I like Mike Rinella's designs a lot. NWBM does a surprisingly good job of recreating a very tense and precarious situation for the Southern forces. One bridgehead across the Pumonkey river and Richmond is toast. Highly recommend using the advanced rules once you have the system down. They favor the CSA a little but trust me...as Bobby Lee you will need all the help you can get once the AOTP gets rolling. For the Union it's all about forcing river crossings and having reserves at hand to exploit them.

An area movement game, it captures the essence of the Cold Harbor campaign strategy in a fairly simple system (some rule questions, but easily cleared up) Both sides have a tense series of decisions to make...the CSA looks at all of those Yankees and thinks...How am I suppose to stop that blue tide....on the other hand the Union looks at the clock, looks at the CSA entrenchments and wonders if he will ever get across the rivers...much less into Richmond. One the best ATO games so far....  On fault...battles are vulnerable to the dreaded 2-12 split of this system,  which could be alleviated if the defenders were given a fixed value and only the attacker rolled.

RATING: 4
Didn't like it very much.  High outlier factor as a bad roll or two can swing the entire game.  As a game, it is too easy to derail by having one favorable attack go wrong.  The modest percentage roll for Lee's Health can also have a huge impact if he should sicken on turn one (and, like others, I'm not at all sure what spending the advantage to make him sick is supposed to represent).

I can see what other people like about it, but this one's not for me...

Initial rating based on solitaire play of basic game rules.

Fun and fast playing.  Both sides have lots of meaningful decisions to make about where to move thier units and when to launch assaults.  Assaults are very difficult for the attacker, so there's lots of incentive to mauever.  But eventually you run out of room to manuever and the enemy is spread out, so assaults become tempting.  The "sunset dice roll" mechanic provides uncertainty and enough variety to ensure replayability.

I don't really like the "Advantage" mechanic though.  It doesn't make sense to use it for Lee's health (the Union didn't have biological warfare targeting the CSA leaders and the CSA medicine wasn't that good) and I don't think the command advantages it confers should necessarily alternate.  An action or command point allowance may work better.

I didn't think Cold Harbor would be a good battle for this kind of game design, but NWBM offered the most plausible historical narrative of any area impulse game I've played.

RATING: 7
Quite a title on an otherwise less gamed subject in ACW.  The leaders counters are nice. An area impulse-driven (a system that is devised and further developed by no more proficient than Michael Rinella) wargame on one of the campaign that edged to end the American Civil War earlier in May 1864. The Union was maneuvering closed to the capital of the Confederate - the city of Richmond. The struggle between the two titanic generals Lee and Grant was never meant to be such direct and personal before. 

The system is designed to be "fluid" like Lock n' Load to ASL at an otherwise operational level.  Units are mostly divisions and a few independent brigades. Daily turn, each is divided into the timing of a day from dawn till dusk (only 5 major phases). The areas are joined together by open or river boundary lines.  Units are activated by army (not necessarily in the same Active area) or corps (must be in the same Active area) leaders to move or combat.  Stacking is limited to 10 units per area from each side.  It is quite fun and clear to move a large group of counters from one area to another in front of your opponent. The "Advantage" marker can be used to re-roll any dice, even to determine the health of General Lee. The marker is advanced each time an impulse is completed.   

Overall, there are many little chromes and they "cook" up the military options at the time very well. You really feel you are riding on a horse to command, seeing all the supply wagons moving in front of you, under a hot timid sky.

Played one quick game which I enjoyed for the decision-making. System (and situation) seem more likely to produce sparring and jabbing than no-holds-barred assaults.

Rating after 1 face-to-face playing (a loss for me as the Confederates).  This rating could go up based off another play, but could just as easily go down.  The South is far to dependent on Lee staying healthy to have a chance and the claimed 'Southern leadership advantage' does not present itself nearly enough to be an advantage against a good Union player.  Gameplay also seems to revolve around more maneuver than fighting so don;t expect to see a linear Civil War battle break out - and if it does I don't see the Rebels lasting too long.

Greatly enjoyed this after one play and in spite of several mistakes we made during our first game (the rules are complete but a bit terse and left us uncertain on a few points; turns out we guessed wrong on all of them).  After looking at the Clarifications doc assembled from Consimworld and attached here, I'm anxious to have another go.  Rating may change after further play (up or down), but it is quick-moving and should be even more tense once we're playing it right!

Updated rating down 1 point:  Just cannot see how the CSA keeps from getting wiped out unless the days end very quickly.  Still an interesting challenge.

Classic game depicting Grant vs Lee from after the Wilderness to Cold Harbour as the Union tries to take Richmond in 1864 (they failed). The counters and map are good and the rules excellent, but the game suffers from there only being two Union strategies. Plan A is to bull straight ahead, especially if the Confederates start moving divisions east to avoid Plan B. Plan B is to constantly shift troops to the east and try to outflank the ANV, crossing the Santa Anna Rivers before the fords are manned. There are slight variations or course and the game can be played inside four hours even with much thinking, so good for tournament play.

This is a nice addition to the area/ impulse group of games and does adapt well to the ACW.  There is a lot maneuver and bluffing to this game.  Where the Union will cross is a big factor for both sides to handle and make sure the units are deployed to handle the adaptive situation.
The setup is very misleading to new players, because the Union has virtually no hope for success by just attacking south.  Instead the union must sweep east and pick a weak crossing point along the right side of the map.  May make it historically accurate but I found it very irritating as a game.  Setup all the units and then spend the entire first turn undoing the game setup. Then turn 2 you can actually start attacking.  
Most other area/ impulse games get the fighting going from impulse 1 with a VP/turn time limit that puts pressure (and tension) on both sides that really make the system shine more then this title does.  Still not a bad game, but will not top BKN or MG in my game choice pile.

Haven't played the final version yet, but played a lot through the testing phase.  This game is a LOT of fun.  Yes the Union has a chance to win--we had probably 4 Union wins and 6 Confederate wins, and were playing significantly different strategies each time.  The decisions are tense as the Union can win through gaining control of enough of the VP areas, and there are not anywhere near enough Confederate troops to cover them all, so you really have to plan and work your fighting retreat well.  The random turn end makes it a tense decision on when to time maneuver and attack--wait too long and you're out of luck.  Strike to soon and your opponent can counter.

Note that my playing has been from a "gaming" point of view more so than from a simulation point of view.  Although I've looked up much more since, when I started the testing on this game, I'd never heard of this particular, yet important, campaign.

The replay value for this game is outstanding--the best I've ever seen from a magazine game (which I am often only interested in playing a couple times)!

After playing with the final version now, this gets bumped up to a 10 -- all the great stuff above, but with terrific artwork, extremely clear rules, great counters.  It's a beauty and a great play.

I think this is the best game value of 2007!

RATING: 8
Surprisingly replayable, constant varying decision trees, and tense action make this one a bonafide winner. 

The system emphasizes manuever and command so smoothly, and just doesn't rely on combat. It's elegant and engaging at the same time.

Rules are solid and the graphics are both pleasing and functional, which is not the norm for ATO. Advanced and Optional rules allow for extra chrome and balanced gameplay.
 
Great ftf and good solitaire, too. 

Faithfully recreates the campaign, yet doesn't handcuff the players. Allows ample insight into the difficulties that each Commander historically faced.

Easily the best ATO game so far, and one of the finest magazine games that I've played multiple times - kudos to designer Rinella.

Extremely tense from the get go.  A wonderfully elegant design.  Great look too.

RATING: N/A
Simple rules, but an interesting situation, relatively open despite the constraints (there are only a few places where artillery can cross the river.) 

Despite its simplicity, the game can be long because there are lots of opportunities for analysis - from moves to assaults. The impulse system means there is little downtime, though.

Have played three sessions, of four to be played.  Getting the rules down better, and getting a stronger sense of the 'feel' and challenges that each general faced back in 1864.  Will write a  review after four plays.

RATING: 8
Fun, light, fast-paced Civil War game.  Captures the attritional feel of the Overland Campaign well.

RATING: N/A
Lots of tension as the sunset die roll mechanism is well suited for representing the risk in not acting aggressively/soon enough or risk losing the ability to act (remind you of any civil war leaders?) Lots of choice and quick playing.  We need more games like this.

Very bland, this one just did not grab me.  There is no differentiation between the sides in the conflict.  The penalty imposed on the south by Lee's failing health effectively means that the Union has an ahistorical leadership superiority.  This effect is exacerbated by the presence of the Advantage mechanic (which allows re-rolls and other rescues).  While the South must use their "advantage" to often rescue Lee, the Union has no such restriction and thus always has the upper hand.  Given their thin forces and the over-numerous VP locations they must defend, it seems victory for the South is likely a rarity against all but the most inept Union play.  The other major flaw of the game is that your troops enjoy too much mobility.  the situation is far too fluid to represent an ACW campaign.  There is very little penalty for disengagement, which is very atypical of the period. I won't rate it lower only because it is a wargame, and therefore I did derive some enjoyment from it, but I am extremely unlikely to ever look at it again.

An all around excellent area movement game. The usual ATO top of the line graphics.

This is the first time I've ever been excited about a game that's come in a magazine.  Not only that, but I was surprised to find a great article on the battle, written by Mr. Rinella himself, included.  I'm thinking of knocking this one off (my shelf of unplayed games) next, so maybe I'll have an update for all you loyal listeners soon.

Very playable game.
Rule is clear and well-written.
Number of units is easy to handle.
Honestly speaking, first I had thought cold harbor campaign is difficult to be interesting.  But, this game reversed my thought.
Based on only 1 play, though.

Too much ameritrash for my sake, with luck-impact and unbalanced decks in many scenarios (unbalance between factions here is what sometimes is mistaken for fancy asymmetry).  A nice board.  But an appalling artwork in all the rest.

RATING: 7.5
Juego de conquista y dominio que tiene a los ochos grandes imperios que hubo en la antigüedad en torno al mediterraneo (Iberia, Galia, Roma, Grecia, Macedonia, Persas, Egipto y Cartago).

El juego se lleva con un motor de cartas. Tienes un número de cartas limitadas y tienes que gestionarlas adecuadamente.. algunas son para batallas y otras para otras acciones (cartas imperiales).

Está muy bien y es montón de interactivo. El sistema de batalla es sencillo, por lo que, a pesar de que lo probé a 8 jugadores y hay multitud de batallas, se desarrolla rápido. 

Se podría clasificar como un wargame ligerito. Está al alcance de todo el mundo. 
Sólo lo he probado a 8 jugadores, aunque el editor me dijo que a cuatro también va bien.. calculo que menos la experiencia pierda intesidad.

I playtested one of the early versions of the game and I liked it very much. Is a fast card driven area control game with lots of flavor (the cards are nicely documented even if the game is not "historical"). There are dice. Tons. You better like them! 

On of the best things about the game is that it plays really well even with five or six players (I played two six players games) with very low downtime and high intereaction.

Interesting approach. Only Fortifications are on board - troups and fleets are represented by cards in your hands.

First outing with 4 players. Mediterranean Empires has some nice features - an attractive board, relatively simply rules, and yet quite a lot of historical atmosphere provided by the individual card decks . However, this first attempt was made rather lengthy, and at times frustrating, by the relatively poor rule book - it lacks an overview of key mechanics and thus you are forced to resort to the rather wordy descriptions. If someone knows the rules well and then teaches them, then I think the game play would progress without too many problems. But learning from the rules book and referring to it during play is a hard slog for such a simple game (we got a couple of fairly important rules wrong through most of the game). I really wonder why an overview of key mechanics couldn't have been put on the player aids, rather than taking up space repeating tables that are already on the board. I will try the game again and it's likely that it will go more smoothly, but I wouldn't risk it with more than 4 players - I think it would be just be too long for what it offers (it is, after all, a rather luck-based game). Further negatives are the unattractive artwork and poor attention to detail in the editing/translation - a whole chunk of Spanish text got left on the player aids. My rating reflects my expectation that the game experience will improve once we get over the initial rules problems.

Juego realizado por un usuario de la bsk. Cada jugador dirige una civilización que tiene relación con el mediterraneo antiguo. Se realizan batallas en el mar pero también tiene mucha importancia la gestión del mapa

Un juego de conquistas y destrucción en la Edad Antigua.
Tiene un uso muy original de las cartas, ya que en el tablero no colocas ejercitos, solo marcadores de control, los ejercitos los usas desde tus cartas y van al descartes despues de cada batalla, con lo cual cuenta mucho el faroleo, y no desgastar pronto la mano, ya que solo la rellenas al final de cada turno...

I like this game a lot. Very easy war game, interesting player decks and abilities. I wonder why it didn't get the attention it deserves.

After only one play (5 players game) I still don't have a complete vision of the game so I just want to add some first impressions. 

First of all, the production values are the worst of my collection. There are plenty of things to complain:
* The cardboard map is hard to flatten.
* Some wooden pieces were stuck among them.
* The art is awful.
* The game cards are the worst I've ever found in a board game.
* The game rules are poorly written.

But, after you jump over the obstacles the game itself it's pretty decent. After one play.

Pros:

* Plenty of interaction
* Well balanced, most of the players within a bunch of VPs. First/Second turn you have to deal with barbarians and neutral cities but after the second half of the second turn cold war warms up.
* Each faction is different and must be played in a different way to overcome success.
* Decent play time for what the game offers. We've played our fist play (5 players) in two hours and a half (with a 30 minutes rules explanation). Basically 30 minutes per player for a first play is great for a game like this. You have to know that this is not a 4x, this is a 1x. There is no exploration, there is no technology improvement, there is no building construction (only defense improvement). 
* Turn ending luck-based and decided by a roll of dice. This is good in some way as you have to deal with your resources taking this into account but it has a dark side too. Sooo, this lead us to the cons

Cons:
* Luck. Tons of it. Plenty of it. If you like control this is not your game. Your best strategy can be ruined by a dice roll. Your game resources are your cards and you can have the best army saved for an attack to be completely ruined by a bad roll crossing a straight. Or maybe you are carrying your troops by sea and a player uses the storm card, rolls a six and your entire army sinks. 1/6! 4 and 5s sinks one ship so maybe half of your army sinks and you cannot fulfill your mission. There are no mechanisms to increase your chances. You have no "cancel your event" cards neither "increase your chances" cards. You cannot set up an strategy to overcome this bad rolls
* Some cards are overpowered and your card draw is extremely important. Some factions have "draw three cards" card, that increases your hand effectively in two. When you have a 12 card draw, two more cards over the rest of the players make a big difference. The are some "I conquer this city cards". Some factions can only use them against neutral cities but others can use them against your cities. Some of this cards are luck based "roll a D6 and 3+ or 4+ you conquer the city". Conquering a city usually takes you 2-6 (depending of your target city size) cards of your scarce resources. Having this cards make a huge difference and some powers (the Macedonians, f.e.) are based on this cards as their military power is not that good. 

So, final words. Is this a bad game? Not at all. Basically I try to think about it as an ameritrash. Wooden pieces and old ages theme make it look like an euro but basically it has ameritrash game mechanics. Come on, the game itself comes with tons of dice and you need them. Each round (a turn is composed of a variable amount of them) starts with a roll. You play an event card/ you attack something. Your event card makes you sometimes roll a dice. You attack a neutral place and the roll 2-4 dice. You attack somebody and you roll some dice and they roll some dice. You are always rolling dice. And as an ameritrash, it works. We've spent a fun afternoon playing this. It's not the game of our lives, it's not the game of the year and I do not know if I must recommend you it. But is it a bad game? Not at all.

A great piece of shit. A complete disaster with an incomprehensible map, the ugliest graphic design ever seen in a 21st century board game, unbalanced, unplayable, 0% strategy, 100% random.... Go away from it.

A new product for our Bellica Third Generation line of production. 
NOT A WARGAME, but an very nice strategic game within a historical framework.

The components are average. The thin cardboard point markers should be wooden (you move them a lot and it's easy to move them by accident, and you don't see them well when stacked) and the art is really atrocious. 

I like the overall idea: a card driven "wargame-ish" experience with the cards as limited resources and the uncertainty of the turn end. If you exhaust your resources, you'll become a universal target. If you save them for too long, you will not use them and they will go to waste; you'll be at disadvantage against the players who used them. The historic background reflected on the cards is also one of the strongest attractive features of the game.

But it is one of those games where whatever you do, the actions of the other players matter ten times more to your status. A couple of cards played can easily blow away any lead. There are cards that can make you lose 2 cities, which you will need to spend an average of 6 cards to recover; 6 cards are one half of your allotted cards for the turn, and one sixth of your resources for the full game. Yes. With *just* one card, and 2 easy rolls (+50%). It happened to me *twice* in my first game.

Leads can be cut off very easily. Military alliances against the leader are actually the hard way, because it's easier to direct the negative events against him (they are free, but they will consume his resources) or play Empire cards, way too powerful.

Given these circumstances, it's pretty evident that the game will be undecided until the last moves. And what's more, the scoring mechanism makes almost sure that the player with more cities at the end will win (10 "sure" points + 6 " almost sure" points). And with the endgame depending on a dice roll, the identity of the winner will be quite unpredictable.

I'm not motivated to engage in a 4 hour game, with long downtimes, where carefully planned moves are less important than playing a card. Also, why do I need to play the first 3 hours if only the final moves matter?

A great game with a simple yet effective system, that escalates very well with the number of players.

Played twice the almost final version, waiting for it to be in the market!

  Juego de conquistas y gestion de imperios. Mucho tema, muy asimetrico y con escenarios segun el numero de jugadores (2-8). Los componentes son regulones pero el juego en si esta muy bien. Cada Imperio se juega y se siente  diferente. Muy divertido aunque peca de hacerse largo y de un factor suerte muy acuciado.

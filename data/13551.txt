RATING: 6.5
Good card hand management game that has the enjoyable trading component of Bohnanza or Settlers of Catan, combined with some route-planning, a small amount of memory work, and collecting of resources.  The classic money=points is effectively used.  Plays well with 2 and scales up to 5.  Nothing groundbreaking, but a solid combination of familiar elements.

We played a 3 player game of this on 7/15/08. Although we had one player that was a little too spaced out to understand the rules in any real capacity (a danger of public meetups in Berkeley, CA) - the other player and I really enjoyed our two player match. 

It's a neat game with a nice mesh of tactical and strategical elements. Would like to try again soon with more and less players.

A cool trading game with a nice bit of economics thrown in... figuring out if it's worth it to get to that point of marginal return, or to play up front for money is interesting to me. I didn't do very well in our first playing, mostly b/c I got distracted with getting large sets of goods when I should have been balancing that with present income a bit better. I'm very excited to play this again... the rating could go up.

Fairly decent set collection game, with some push your luck elements and luck mitigation.  Theme is fairly non-existent.  There is definitely more strategy involved than luck, but not enough to make this a main course.

Would play again, no problem.

For my family, there are other games we'd rather play that clock in around an hour, so I do not need to own this.

Technically, only played to the interim scoring round to clear the table for Thanksgiving dinner. However, I think I get the general idea of what the game is about, so I logged it. Basically, it's a more complicated version of Bohnanza (set collection with points for consecutive cards). From my point of view, Oltremare is much nicer looking and much more preferable to play. Awkward to start with all new players, but easy to understand once things get going. Those 3-D ships keep falling apart.

UPDATE 1: Reduced my ranking simply because when I started thinking about this game, the long setup time kept coming to mind (too fiddly)... and then I somehow decided that maybe Bohnanza wouldn't be such a bad idea after all. UPDATE 2: Now all that this game brings to mind is those darned boats that keep falling apart, what a pain! - and the beautiful cards and map... is that enough for me to keep the game? UPDATE 3: This game doesn't have nearly as much going for it as other to-be-traded contenders. Although I don't care much for Elfenlands right now, that map is fantastic, it has a solid game designer behind it, it's a SdJ, and I really like King of Elves.

Fantastic play.  It takes a while to get your head wrapped around the scoring, but the game itself is great!

One problem I have with this one is the boats.  It is tough to keep track of where people are due to the colors of the boats not being that obvious.  I'm thinking of finding some replacement pieces in the five colors just to simplify this...

This was on my watch list for years.  Tiny box (first release), love sea themes, enjoy trading, etc.  I thought it could be it!  Cooler winds prevailed as time passed and ratings didn't excel, but I did eventually get to play it when a friend picked it up in a trade.  MAN.  What a proxy let-down!  I could nit-pick on details, but principally the 3P table found it very lifeless and very overlong.  I can't possibly see it improving to a game that would interest me with any head count.

[Comments based on both 1st and 2nd Editions.]

This is a nice trading game that flies under the radar more than it should.  Game play is solid and rewarding.  The differences in the 2 versions available is largely aesthetic.
1st Edition: A great little game that plays bigger than the box would indicate.
2nd Edition:  Nice component improvements and minor tweaks to the game map also help.  
Either version is a great game to add to a collection.

Felt like Bohnanza, but with nice extra bits and ideas.  Travel game sized, great value if you can find a copy, especially at 14 Euro at Essen 2004.

Now played second edition, big box game.  More refined graphics.  Game suffered from other players refusing to trade with me after I had big half time lead which was unsatisfactory.  Game rightly finishes with all players having equal turns.  It would be better if this were also situation at the half time scoring which favours those playing earlier in the round as they will have had an extra turn.

Jó a játék, sok ötletes elemmel, de szerintem túl egyértelmű a stratégia (mindig arra kell törekedni, hogy sok lapot tudjunk lepakolni, 3-at vagy 4-et, az se baj, ha kalózkodás miatt sok lapunk lent lesz, mert mindegyik csak minusz 1 pont, felvásárolni ritkán éri meg őket, viszont sokkal többet nyerünk a lepakolt kártyákon). Ötletes, hogy a kereskedést is díjazza a játék, és jó az áruk pontozási mechanizmusa is. A tengeri rész nem tetszik, durván szerencsefüggő, hogy hova kerül a hajó. A holtversenyt vagy félreértettük, vagy ha nem, akkor igazságtalan (ha holtverseny van az élen, akkor a 3-dik helyeztt megkapja a 2. helyért járó pontot?? Nemár.) Megérte kipróbálni, tudott újat mutatni, de nem látom a többutas nyerést benne...
Ja, egyébként szép a tábla!

RATING: 6
Not very good.  I only rate it this high because I am holding out hope that it will be better with 4 or 5 players than it was with three (not to mention two).  

Goods Trading games (or any trading games, really) that rely on the trade as the sole source of player interaction almost never work for me, unless a strong motivation to trade is provided (and it isn't here).  Bohnanza with ships is what's being thrown together here.  You can gain some special abilities by navigating a map of the Mediterranean for special-ability tokens, but that's all you use the board for.

Murky mechanics will brook argument among folks who like to over-analyze every ambiguous rule.  Also dislike the scoring:  major scoring only occurs twice in the game (middle and end).  The rest of the time the scoring track is a place to play tiddly-winks without really knowing how you are doing.

Most disappointing of all is that I just can't imagine anyone in my life wanting to play this with me much.  Some of the hand management rules are interesting, but it's a card game disguised as a board game, and my crowd never wants to do that.  Seems intended for a narrow niche audience.  I don't know why game companies wouldn't rather support games that could actually sell.

After reading the rules you're thinking...this sounds like a pretty simple game, but then you quickly find out that you need to be thinking about all the things that can happen with a basic card play.

Ok, so after a couple of plays, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed.  There doesn't seem to be nearly the kind of tension in trades as are present in 'Bohnanza', and while the pirate stack is annoying on your points, it seems like it will cost you more money to empty it than you would lose by keeping it there.  It just seems like a few things are missing...

Oh, this is a tricksie beast. It's so easy to go into the red sometimes - and it's fun to find a game that lets you go there!

The way the cards are so packed with meaning is very neat. The small board (I've got the original) is a bit of a turn-off for some, but I think it's great that such a big game fits in such a small box. I play with poker chips instead of the board...I find it makes trading easier and more fun. 

Sometimes it seems to go on for 15 minutes longer than it should...hopefully, with more experienced players this will go away.

The trading is a little too flexible, and the incentives cause you to trade just for the heck of it. It works just fine, but I think it could have been better as a pure card game, as the map and chips could have been simplified.

We were introduced to this game by a friend of ours Jan 2005.  We had a 3 player session and I liked the mechanics.  The cards artwork is splendid also.  One remark perhaps :  3 players is too few I think to have a smooth and good trading atmosphere.  Also the trading quickly ended when everybody tried to get rid of his/her cards with a pirate symbol on it.  I'd like to play this one again with 4 players.  Remark : In order to limit the play length we removed the 20 cards with corn.  Play length after this was 01h45.

Fun card game.  Similarities to Bohnanza exist, but this game is much more complex.  I haven't played the new edition but it sounds like it doesn't encourage trade as well as the original because every individual commodity card in the new edition can be loaded for 1 point (versus the original game where some commodities require at least 2 of a kind to earn points, that is, a single card is worth 0 points).  **UPDATE** Seems like the icons on the cards are identical (or possibly each type of cargo card comes in only 2 varieties in terms of icons)... this really hurts the game in my opinion... because if you save up 3 cloth to play at once, and each one has a pirate icon, you get nailed and have to add 6 cards (-1pt each) to your pirate stack.

This is a cardgame disguised as a boardgame.
It`s a kind of set collection game, with some original mechanics. The celver twist that the card maximun at beginn of your turn is linked to the game you must play. The sum is every time 7 and ranges from 6-1, 5-2, 4-3 or 3-4 (The first digit is the hand limit). The cards have 2 of 4 additional items, which grants you vp, cards, special markers/actions, or negative vp (pirate cards).
Cards can be bought costly for vp at the bank or traded with the other players.
At all a very good, fresh and difficult to master card game.

(5 plays) This game feels as if the author has conglomerated some time-tested game mechanics (set collecting, trading cards among players, ...) while forgetting to glue them. All these mechanics work well, but they don't sum up to a well balanced game. An example: the game is first and foremost a card collecting game. But there is this odd game board, which has almost nothing to do with the rest of the game except for holding some bonus chits. Fortunately there's a lot going on with the cards: they are not only goods, which you collect, they also affect your game play and your options for your moves. I really like this, although it doesn't make it more than an average game for me.

Oltre Mare is actually a pretty interesting experience. It's the second game I've played by Emanuele Ornella, and it's palpably similar to Hermagor in its system of intricately interlocking mechanics that lead to minuscule gains. This points to one of the two problems I had with the game. The top three players ended up within two points, and we were all doing pretty different things. I didn't feel like there was a reason to pursue any particular strategy beyond looking for the niche no one else was filling; every path seemed to lead to equivalent rewards.

The other problem I had was the bonus for making lots of trades. Trading is intrinsically advantageous already; the bonus for most trades really seemed a disincentive for trading. Thinking about it now it seems that may have been the purpose of the mechanic. I kind of want to try again to determine whether that's a worthy part of the games design or something I just plain don't like.

I'd always ignored Oltre Mare, prejudiced because it was a "trading" game (and hence would suck for 2) and because it was always in everyone's bargain bin.  I got to try it at my gaming group, though, and I was hooked.  This is a great, lighter game - could be filler, maybe a bit long for it (at least with 2).  The trading element is pretty subdued even with more than 2, so it hardly matters how many players you have.  This is more of a set collection game at heart.  There are many unique mechanisms in this one - I especially like how the cards are used for so many different purposes.  Stringing together combos in an order that works well is a real challenge!  I also appreciate how money and VPs are the same thing, so you track your income on the board, not with chits.  Lots of good stuff in this one - if you see it for cheap, grab a copy.

Not that impressed; some good ideas, but feels a bit rough overall. This is basically Bohnanza with a bunch of stuff added in that makes it more fiddly and complicated, but from a gameplay perspective largely just unduly constrains player choice. Certainly, if you're a big Bohnanza fan you should probably avoid OltraMare, since it is largely Bohnanza without the balance, attention to detail, scope for expansion, or quality in general. OltraMare is too constrained for the serious gamer, and too fiddly for the casual or crossover set. Stick with Bohnanza or Quo Vadis at the low end, Chinatown in the middle, and Traders of Genoa at the high end.

This game is management at its finest as you try to balance what you've done with what you plan to do.  The card you have played must jive with what you've built in the past and also sets you up for your future turn so there is a lot going on.  It's easy to fall into one of the many traps that can snare you when playing cards and if you're not careful, the brilliant turn you had this round may be your downfall on the next.

RATING: 7
Great game!  Similar to Bohnanza in that players trade quite a bit in an effort to collect sets in a certain order, but more of a 'gamers game' in that there is more to it, including special powers and other card uses.

This one often gets touted as "Advanced Bohnanza" and in some ways that's true, but it has a very different feel than Bohnanza that makes a direct comparison kind of weird, though they are both games that sort of revolve around making the most of your forced plays. Oltre Mare's got a bit more going on that makes what you HAVE to do more player-driven, whereas Bohnanza's system is more unforgiving (giving it a level of tension that Oltre Mare lacks - so while there are more interesting strategies at work here, Bohnanza has gotten more love from me).

The whole hand limit/action system is quite clever and makes for some interesting strategy that ties into the trading quite nicely... especially as you don't have to be honest about what's exactly on your cards.

It's sort of weird that the board play feels so removed from the rest of the game, and maybe this would have gotten more attention as a pure card game... but in a game so otherwise simple it's nice to have just one other little option on your turn that you can take into account for some bonuses/scoring.

All in all, this is a neat little game. It doesn't have the emotional punch of Bohnanza that accounts for Bohnanza's more ferocious trading, but there's a lot of things to consider on your turn and figuring out how to maximize your gains is really fun in a way like not much else.

Interesting trading, collecting and hand management game.  Plays like Bohnanza with special powers.  Some people don't grok this game because of changing hand limits and the additional special actions of the cards.  There is a lot to figure out here and unfortunately, it paralyzes AP-prone players.  It is good for my daughter and I, our games are 30 minutes.

I've always been apprehensive about trying this game because I heard comparisons to Bohnanza.  Really, this game is much better than that.  I felt there was even a slight learning curve to the game.  I'm definitely up for playing this again.  Also, the Amigo version is really pretty.

OK game, but has elements that I just don't like: 
The hand limits just seem like a tacked-on fake way of creating tension.  

The luck of the draw for commodities and pirates seems overwhelming and, like most games, among intellegent traders can never be mitigated. 

Too long for the amount of chaos. In fact, long enough that playing Traders of Genoa/Bohnanza would always seem preferable.

RATING: 6.5
There were a few interesting mechanics, mainly that the way you stack your cards in this round has a big impact on your next round. The “Bohnanza” trading was better implemented than I expected, so I was pleasantly surprised to see my group negotiate this much each turn about which cards they wanted. The fact that you may lie about everything but the actual type of card makes the trading much more fun, especially when you pass a card with a pirate symbol to another player! 

Still, even though the above might seem very positive, the game didn’t grab me that much. The movement around the board wasn’t interesting and the luck of the draw could have a big impact on the final scores, particularly when the mid-scoring card is revealed.

It's an ok game, but there are so many other games I would rather play, so I doubt I am going to play this much in the future.

Updated: This game is considerably more interesting with fewer players, though still not my cup of tea. It is a hand-management game, and not a bad one. The trading aspect is overrated. Without the prestige tiles it would be non-existant. I'm sure there are ways to take advantage of asymetrical values more effectively, but the effort:reward ratio is minimal. I'd rather just collect my sets, get cards as cheap as possible, give up a freebie card (or sell it for a buck or two) to pick up a prestige tile. Of course this puts you at the mercy of the draw. When it comes down to it, it doesn't provide the kind of problem-solving challenge I enjoy, nor does it offer a rich social experience that a trading game should. Still on my trade list.

Original: My first play of it, I was really looking forward to it. But I found the board-play to be a bit busy. There was just a bit too much going on. After thinking about it a bit afterward, I'm wondering if I'll like it a lot more on the second try. I think we were all a bit too focused on the set-collection. We didn't really think too much about the other ways of making money. I think I need to give this another try. But for now, a somewhat uncharitable 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The multi-dimensional aspect of the vard values is distracting and makes judging card values unnecessarily hard and luck-based for a game which concentrates so heavily on the intersection of hand management with small (and variant) hand size limits.  It makes the game much more random and luck-based than I'd prefer, especially for a game of this (admittedly modest) length and weight.

I think this game has been a tad overrated by the general population at BGG. I admire the way the designer was able to milk every last square millimetre of space on the card, and the game is certainly good, but it didn't have enough to really wow me either. The goods management feels like a soft Bohanza system (though hand order doesn't matter) and though I like some of the other ideas (an active incentive to trade, special power chits) the overall game plays a bit too long for my tastes. Not at all bad, but not remarkable either, rather thoroughly  average...although I will say, the haggling innuendo in this game trumps Settlers by far with the "bag of butt" (if you see the art you'd understand) being a key factor... (addendum: that was removed in the 2nd edition...peh)

You know what this game is missing?  FUN.  This has got to be one of the most dull, lifeless games I've ever had the displeasure of playing.  Indeed, there are some elements of Bohnanza but where that game used restrictive hand management to generate energy and a built-in trading impetus, this game throws on a bunch of elements that are basically meaningless abstractions (like the "pirate stack") and a more or less worthless board that has little to do with the actual game other than to track where the bonus chips are.  I think all the hype and excitement from last year was pretty much wasted on this one, a game that seems to further indicate how far standards have slipped in the gaming community.  I'm sick of designs trying so hard to be clever that they neglect to be FUN or at least INTERESTING.

How can a game about moving freight along Mediterranean shipping routes remind me so much of bean farming?  In Oltre Mare, the second phase of a player's turn is negotiation - trading or giving cards to manipulate your hand - which feels much like Bohnanza.  The cards played in the next phase provide bonuses that increase in a triangular rate (except for movement): advancement on the ducat track, drawing cards to your pirate stack, drawing cards to your hand, or moving your ship.  Ship movement that ends on a harbor with a bonus gives that bonus to the player in their next turns while it remains active.

This is a clever little game, and not only because the ships are very cool three dimensional ships assembled from chits punched out of a plastic card.  There are some interesting things going on - negotiation, hand management, set collection - that all happens in less time than I'd expect.

RATING: 7
Fun game that sat on my shelf unplayed, for so long.  Nice card mechanics to set hand limit and the number of cards you will play next turn.  Excellent with only 2 players, as the game just flows quicker.  3 players would have had more trading, but I feel we had enough in our 2 player game.  A familiar type of scaled scoring for the card points and buying of new cards.  This one is a  keeper!

A game from Emanuele Ornella in which I cannot spot his characteristic fondness for meaningless choices, actually something of a surprise. In my mind I always seem to confuse Oltre Mare with another one of Emanuele's games, Il Principe, but the two are very different; and other than a vague geographical similarity the games have very little in common.

Oltre Mare features contrived card management: cards are in your hand, and on two separate stacks. One stack is face down, the other face up, and despite knowing exactly what you put on the latter, you may not look through it. I guess the author wants me to practice doublethink. The top card of the open deck determines hand size and amount of cards to be played this turn; you may purchase cards from the closed deck or a general draw pile for a lot of monies, or trade with the other players who get a VP for their efforts. Then you play the correct number of cards, count a lot of icons on them determining your actions for this turn (getting money, purchasing cards cheaply, discarding cards onto the closed deck, or 'ship' which moves around a ship on a small map to ports where bonus actions are to be had), then drop the cards in any order you wish onto your open pile. This not only puts them in a certain sequence netting you big VP at the end of the game, but also, again, determines various card limits for the next turn.

All in all quite a 'compact' game, perhaps even too much so as cards are used for so many things at the same time that your own actions are nearly always a compromise rather than something you [i]really want to do[/i]. This felt too much like the game was causing friction on its own rather than letting it originate between the players, which is a pattern I don't much care for. Another nail in the game's small coffin is that it requires players to circumvent the luck of the draw by trading amongst themselves... ick. This is required because some trade goods are rarer than others, yet you will have no real way of steering which ones you get save through, well, trade. Some will absolutely dig this; I find it just brings out the worst in everyone I play against, bringing the system (and thus the game) to its knees. But don't let my apprehension stop you from trying out the game on your own; perhaps you like the hence-and-forth better than I did. 

For my part, I'm going to stick to other 'compact' games for the time being.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game.  It has rules that are easy to pick up, very nice components, and gameplay that's good for families.

Players attempt to ship goods around the Mediterranean by playing them from their hands.  But the cards played determine the player's current benefits and obligations, while the top card determines the limitations for the next round.  And landing in certain ports provide certain benefits.  Planning ahead is crucial.

Meanwhile, players have the opportunity to trade cards with each other, which is why this game seems to work better with more players.  Then again, the game gets progressively shorter with the # of players.  My guess is that 3 players is the sweet spot, but I enjoyed it with 4.  Definitely recommended!

A card manipulation game, where you have to manage what you hold, what you play, and how you discard.

Once an 8...now a 7

Older:
First of all, this instantly became one of my wife's favorites.  I enjoy playing it on top of that.  That's an immediate winning combination.  I could attribute the 8 rating to that alone, but there's more...

There is a lot of potential for player interaction-even in a two player game, and the trading is much more friendly than even Settlers of Catan (which isn't always friendly).  So, the atmosphere around the table usually remains pretty light and positive.  This is a big plus as even so, it's still a competitive game.  Trading becomes more tense with two, but then that just makes trading more interesting in my opinion.

The price point for this game makes it an absolutely incredible value.  I still can't figure out why this is only a $10 game (as of April 2014).  Perhaps it's one of those overlooked gems that is just getting pulled out of production.  Get yours while you can!

Nice small box game.  Players are merchants of Venice, trading in commodities to build their wealth (i.e. victory points).  Players buy/trade cards from the deck/players, then must play out a number of cards indicated by  icons on the top card of their discard pile.  Played cards indicate what actions they take, whether they want to or not.  Nice game that feels a bit like Advanced Bohnanza with a bit of Mamma Mia.  The ship movement and prestige rules feel a bit bolted on, but the game works very well.  New edition (large box) is very nice, good improvement over the first edition.

Egy Bohnanza alapokon induló, de messze nem parti-móka játék, mint a Bohanza. Ugyanúgy adott típusok /termékek/ sorozatát kell gyűjteni, lerakni, DE:
1. kevesebbet  kell az adott típus össz létszámához képest
2. a kereskedését bónusz jár, annak aki kereskedik az aktívval /nem, nem dollhouse/ - így még érdekeltebb a kereskedésben, akár még az ajándékozásban is
3. nem csak lerakom - hanem, és itt jön ami miatt még sokkal másabb: 4 különböző akció is végrehajtódik a lerakás függvényében. Amik igencsak mássá, jobbá teszik.
4.van kéz limit, és van lerakási kötelezettség /ami simán elképzelhető, h a kéz limit alacsonyabb, mint amennyit le kell raknia a játékosnak/
5. és a hajókról se feledkezzünk meg

Összességében: gyors, /kb 1 óra 4 fővel/ játszható 5 fővel is, családi jellegű, vagy be-le vezető játék, könnyen tanulható. Nem egy assyria vagy Hermagor szintű-mélységű, de egy élvezhető jó játék. Azért 8-as, mint a Bohnanza, mert azért a Bohnaza, bár sokkal "kevesebb" játék, de parti játékként, síelésekkor tökéletes. Amúgy az Oltre Mare jobb, az nem vitás. Hátránya: ha már Bohnanza összehasonlítás, h sokkal nagyobb doboz, nem kártya méretű, pedig tán megoldható lett volna az is vhogy, a hajók és kikötők vmilyen más megoldásával.

újabb játék után is: jobb mint a hasonló bab, érdekesebb, izgalmasabb - a legnagyobb bajom, h a hajók jobban megkülönböztethetőek lehetnének.

3. játék: még mindig szimpi. csúnyán utolsó lettem ugyan...(de ma miben nem buktam?:-)), de élvezetes volt, a kereskedés is szimpi volt, jól van kitalálva a játék.

This is an interesting middle-tier set collection/trading game. It's one of those games where you wonder if maybe the game is trying to do too much, but it all seems to work quite well. (I don't mean that it's a really heavy game, just that there's an awful lot going on. I do enjoy it though.)

Slightly similar to Bohnanza in terms of making negotiation and trades in order to get the best order of cards to be played. But it's a busier game that offers more complexity than is really required. The theme is nice but doesn't really shine through in the game anyway.

Just a card game, but I'm shallow enough to be taken in by the map of the Mediterranean and twee little boats.  Haven't played Bohnanza, so I'll focus on the trading and call it Settlers of the Sea.  The prestige tokens that encourage trading are a nice touch, except too much trading makes the game feel too easy.  Pleasant enough, but not terribly exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Regarded by some as a more advanced form of Bohnanza, because the key features are trading and negotiation.  Despite having a nice map, it is still essentially a card game, but after playing it several times it definitely is more satisfying than Bohnanza.  Although a two-player game could be regarded somewhat as a multi-player solitaire race, it still is very enjoyable for two.  Recommended house-rule to eliminate a small memory component: Players can check the top of their freight stack to see how many there are in the set of goods they are currently collecting.

Any trading game that does not lay down a minimum of guidelines really sets itself for failure in my book.  The free for all format of trading annoyed me immediately.  What saves it slightly for me is that the rest of the game flows smoothly.  Not without merit but definitely below other more successful trading games like Bonhanza et al.  And no, the hype did not convert this player.

I've only played it a couple times, but I enjoyed it.  It seems like there's not a real way to mess up your opponents and is a game of organizing your goods and getting the most out of your hand. I think the trading part of the game is kind of odd.  You have quite a bit to think about with all the information on your own cards without trying to take time to trade.  It seems like you're helping others too much when you trade.  I enjoy the game and like the theme, but we don't trade that much.  

Update:  Played some more and it is a fun game.  In a way it seems two hand management games at once.  First you have to manage the cards in your hand and figure out how to play them, and then you have to manage how your ship will move and which chit to pick up and why.  It takes a couple of plays to the board play and the card play working together- and I'm not sure I've figured it out yet!  It's a keeper for me.

I really thought I would like this game but something about it irrates me and I'm not sure what. I think it comes down to too much luck:  there is random nature of the cards you draw, the dishonest negotiations, the variable-length between scoring rounds, the random start position, and random port marker distribution.  It's all too much.  If you have lousy cards and no one will trade there isn't much you can do. And yet my wife and friends really seem to like it so maybe I am just being whiny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think Oltre Mare is another (early) case where just piling up mechanisms doesn't really work for me. There are some interesting challenges in the game, mainly to do with the changing hand limits and assuring a steady card flow, but they relegate the trading aspect to something very insignificant. Even though it seems somewhat Bohnanza-like it doesn't play anything like it. Too much for too little.

A decent game... enought going on to be interesting.  However, every time I've played its just seemed a little slow moving.  Trading is not always your best option and folks seem to spend time proposing trades only to realize minutes later that it's not in their best interest.  Then the proceed with their turn without trading.  It happens too often.  Perhaps asking people before they play to first consider if trading is a good idea before they start the process each turn?   Hmf.  Well, I guess I just prefer my trading games a little more fast-and-furious.

Gosh! You take the pieces out of the box, you make the starting setup, you read the rules and you start playing. No - stop! You don't start playing because in this card game dressed as a board game simplicity of rules is clearly absent. I needed to read the manual THREE times before I was able to understand the meaning of every symbol on the cards and its impact on the gameplay. For a game that lasts about an hour it's unforgivable.

Once you understand the rules the gameplay is fine. You just have to have enough patience to get to that point...

RATING: 7
By the rules it seems that there is a lot going on in this game. In truth the game is quite straightforward and intuitive, not to mention being a lot of fun to play. Mechanics affect each other in many ways and force you to think your actions carefully. Despite this, the game plays quickly, especially after people have gotten familiar with it's rules and little quirks.

Surprisingly good game that is getting a lot of 'overrated' comments these days.  There was a lot of buzz about it initially, so maybe people let their expectations get in the way of their judgement.  :)  You now have a choice between the underproduced game with a tiny board or the overproduced version.  Aside from the ships, which I don't like, the Amigo version of this game is very nice looking and feels like a definite upgrade to a game deserving of a quality edition.

OltreMare is a game ostensibly about Mediterranean maritime trade during the Italian Renaissance period. But what it really is, is Advanced Bohnanza. It really is strikingly similar - although OltreMare is more complex and is aimed at serious gamers rather than casual players.  The game has several interlocking elements, and they're all governed by the commodity cards, which have different symbols representing different tasks or abilities.  It's quite ingenious when you see it all working smoothly together.  The crux of the game is hand management, conservation of resources, and trading.  Recommended.

Played 3  3 players. Rio Grande version. I am starting this off on a low rating but expect it to rise. Don't expect much out of your first couple of games. Similarities to Bonanza. On average you will only have 4 cards in your hand so the trading is not as prevalent as in Bonanza. The board looks nice but does not have much of an impact on the game. I will amend these comments if I play more. *UPDATE* No sense that you are working towards anything. No tension. Note that I don't like Bonanza and I have only played this 3 player. Oct 05

I think this is because we only had three players. I recommend against that.

Think Bohnanza on steroids...

I like the trading element as well as the rule legal "deception" that is allowed.  The harbor tokens offer some intersting elements as well.  Finally, "spending" your victory points to buy cards is another good element as you must determine if you can sacrifice VPs to get that extra card to help you win.

Reasonably fun trading game but I can think of at least three better, off the top of my head: Traders of Genoa, Settlers, Bohnanza. I found myself more annoyed than intrigued at the variable restrictions on hand limit and cards played per turn. What is this, Fluxx? Ok it's not that bad, and I do like trading a lot. So, a 6.

Okay, this was disappointing. A card set-collection game, with a lightly pasted-on nautical theme. Comparisons with Bohnanza (the bean growing game) are accurate. Players are trying to collect sets of progressively more expensive (and more rare) commodities in the card deck. The scoring goes up, much like the commodity cards in Civilization. You want to collect as much grain, or salt, or whatever, to score the most points. Collect one, and you get one point. The cards have novel features on them, as the last card played face up in the "freight" deck (goods that you have shipped) dictates your hand size for next turn, as well as how many cards you can (or must) play next turn. It also dictates how much gold you'll get, or if you'll get penalized by adding to your "pirate" deck, or if you'll get more cards into your hand, or if you will be able to sail around on the small board, collecting "harbor" tokens. There is trading, like any other trading game, and negotiation.

I had visions of sailing the Mediterranean, but the little boats moving from port-to-port on the smallish board don't really mean anything. You're just collecting harbor tokens to give you special powers, or to get more gold (victory points). There is no exploration, no danger of losing your ship. So, you'll get a bunch of cards added to your pirate deck--big whoop. Good mechanics, uninspiring theme.

Update (08/17/10): As long as we're being honest, I have no intention to play this again in the foreseeable future. Downgrading to a '4'.

RATING: 7
An uncomplicated, Settlers-like trading game with a strict hand limit, that  coupled with the fact that you're generally trying to collect one type of card, makes trading less interesting than it might be. Every player should absolutely ensure that they don't run out of cards, if you do your game's over.

RATING: 7
An entertaining trading/set collection game.  I like the pirate stack and the way it can work for or against you.  In playing cards, the tradeoff is between control and profit in a way I have seldom seen in any other game.  Buying cards with points is also an interesting idea.  I definitely enjoyed my second play more than my first and would like to play it again.

Feb09: Completely mediocre to me.  Just go play bohnanza.

The map was superfluous.  Could have just been a card game with a couple rows of chits to pluck from.

The card play wasn't that interesting.  It was sort of neat to not be able to see what you've already played, but I didn't have a problem hitting all my counts right on the head.

The pirates weren't really pirates at all, and were really theme weak.  They also didn't hurt that much.  I went pirate crazy and lost by a point.

The trading wasn't that interesting.  Heck, they had to encourage trading in this one by giving out points for trading the most.  Lame.  I'd prefer my game to encourage trading naturally.

Having said all this, I'd play it again, but I'm just not that interested or impressed.

Oltremare contains some nice ideas. The core of the game is hand management and trading, but there are other mechanisms on top. The result is that there are various ways of scoring and hence multiple strategies to victory. However, after a couple of games I'm still not convinced that the trading aspect works as well as it could, and I get the impression that the scoring mechanisms within Oltremare may not be well-balanced. Nevertheless, my only major criticism is the lack of practicality and poor aesthetics of the tiny board and counters.

Good little game with a good pace to it while also allowing for some trading. You score a few ways but the big one is collecting and playing sets of cards. There is a board in play but you would hardly know it, you pick up bonuses from it but other than that it is NOT part of the game sadly and seems like an afterthought. Too bad as 'pick up and deliver' or fighting at sea both would have worked well on the board, especially being a pirate game. Worked quite well with 2 but I'm sure like a lot of games will be a little more fun with more. I prefer Bohnanza to this as it is a little more fun.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting one. The luck of the cards is rough since trading is a big part of this game and if you keep getting crappy cards you get double hit because no one will trade with you, so you have no chance at the points for most trades, and you don't have long strings of similar types of goods for more points and you're playing cards that have a lot of bad effects on them. Plus the way that the mid game scoring works is a complete crap shoot and can split your big set in half, really taking a lot of your points away. And if you start near someone else and one player starts off pretty isolated they'll have a much easier time utilizing their movements to get chips. It's still reasonably fun but for a game of this length the random factor is a bit too much for me.

After playing Bohnanza, this game has very similar properties.  The trading aspect is similar.  I however find this game much more enjoyable.  I'd rather buy and sell goods from port to port than sell beans..but that is just me.  

Also, I think that not having to keep my hand in a specific order throughout the game is a huge advantage.  Order only matters with the sold goods deck.  This deck has to have the same goods next to each other when the deck is scored in the middle of the game and at the end.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2016)

Earlier in the year, I played Il Principe (also from game designer Emanuele Ornella), it was a regular game for me so I wasn’t expecting much from Oltre Mare, but I was surprised and I kind of like it! 

As with Il Principe, I found two sets of different rules for the game :/. I have the German edition so I had to trust the better redacted set (Rio Grande Games). I dislike this because the difference between the rules seem important and can affect the game deeply. They also use different names and art for the same tokens. I think the worst redacted ones are from Mind the Move.

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 100 minutes with the full complement of players (that is, Oltre Mare plays very fast for a five player game).

Best with 5 players.

The game components are from ok to good. I like the player´s ships, but sadly they are hard to differentiate on the board. The insert works perfectly with sleeved cards (a rarity for a game this old). The first player token has the art from the cover of Il Principe (I think) and I always like when games are connected, even in the connection is very tenuous. When I bought the game, it came with cool player boards, I think the files are here on BGG.

The theme is, literally, trading in the Mediterranean, but you don’t feel it through the game. I´m neutral toward it.

When I was playing the game, I felt like it was an advanced Bohnanza, both games share many similarities. The decisions needed to play the game are on the light side of the spectrum, but they aren’t obvious. Besides you have to negotiate and trade a lot to win and I enjoyed it. There are hard limits of the amount of cards you can begin your turn with and the amount of cards you can play each turn, those limits are decided by the cards themselves, so choosing how to play your cards is a lot of fun. The pirates mechanism is very good at keeping tension up. I also like the small memory element present in the game (I enjoy memory a lot in my games, but I know most gamers do not).

Bottom line, Oltre mare is a solid 6.0 for me. A game I would play if the mood strikes. It is an advanced Bohnanza (which I prefer) with more meat in it. I will keep in in my game collection for now and I want to play it again!

RATING: 8
I like it a lot. Trading cards with other players is the heart of it (with the objective of building sets of similar cards to garner VPs), but there are some very neat gamey mechanics that mesh together nicely to raise it well above Happy Families. They include variable hand size, dratted pirates, money=VPs (at times you'll need to spend VPs to buy cards or spice up a trade but you'd really rather not), cool models ships sailing around the Med to capture harbour makers that offer game advantages, bonus points for active trading and sailing. Recommended.

RATING: 6
FIRST EDITION REMARKS:  A very playable game, with interesting mechanics and tactics.  The end-game needed a tweak to the rules, though.  I lost a game where I was dominant throughout simply because I got one fewer turn than everyone else at the table, and was unable to execute my final play.  If there were a reasonable way to control the timing of the ending, this wouldn't be such a drawback, but there's not.  

We rewrote how the game ends, allowing for it to extend beyond the exhaustion of the deck.

SECOND EDITION REMARKS:  So the second edition also attempts to fix the endgame  issue, and I have played with the official new rule (which was similar to the house rule we had invented).  The end is still hard to control or calculate given the fact that in a five player game, a deck of 20+ cards can disappear from one players' move to his next.  I'm not sure that I like the modified payout schemes (on the surface the new commodity payouts seem more forgiving. . .).   All in all, just a bit too long for the chaos of a five player game.  Perhaps the rating should be better if playing with four.

The cards, as printed, are much too restrictive.  I own the second edition, so I don't know whether these have been changed, but the hand size limits seem to be set arbitrarily low, the quantity of certain goods seems to be artificially high, and the port awards aren't nearly good enough.

The only aspect of the game which everyone liked was the open 'wheeling and dealing' when trading for commodities.

A game like this should come close to Traders of Genoa in game play and enjoyment... it falls well short.

1st ed. Mind the Move.  A card driven game of trading and set collecting with a great deal of emphasis on accessing each action phase.  A lot going on here from a little box.  The mixed action valuation on each commodity card is very slick.  Other than the mild trading involved, OltreMare feels like a game of multi-player solitaire.

I've enjoyed my playings of this game. It is a negotiation game but the cards provide a lot of information that has to be taken into consideration on your turn.  So your looking to stow your cargo while possibly; battling pirates, collecting more cards (which isn't always a good thing), sailing your ship, or collecting gold. The game has quite a bit going on and keeps me involved.

Serious hand management in this game!  You often hear about hand management in games, but I've never felt quite so much pressure about my cards as in this game.  This is unusually rules heavy and initially difficult to teach for such a simple game, something that seems common of Ornella games (though I haven't yet played Il Principe).  But once you get the hang of it (which isn't difficult), it can be quite fun and quick!  Again, though, very overused and boring theme.

Rating for RGG version.

Game play is the same but components-wise, the new version is definitely superior to the old one, unless shelf space is a problem.  The miniature ships are kind of cool, and the map is big enough to read more easily and pick up the chits on the cities.

Everything just seems higher quality, so for $10 you can't go wrong.

And just like Il Principe, I don't know what to think of this game. Very intertwined mechanics almost to the point of fiddliness. There's a very clever card system where each card contains a number of subtle effects that affect the player's next move. Trading was a bit iffy, free cards were flying around to get Prestige points. I understand why trading is needed, but I would've preferred a more regulated system (like maybe, only trade once a turn).

[Old edition] Map was really small and the chits hard to pick up. Otherwise, I think its a pretty good game, although maybe a bit heavier than it looks.

Mechanically a really beautiful game. Easy to learn and teach but demands some experience from the players before it starts to flow on better. At the beginning huge amounts of downtime are possible, but if you like trading and negotiating this is made for you to learn. Higher rating would be possible, but a play takes a tad too long for that. You're sort of running out of steam and willingness to see everything happen again and again during the closing moments, especially when all the goods have become scarce and negotiating isn't fruitful anymore.

After having played this a number of times, I have decided that I still enjoy this trading game. It's inevitably compared with Bohnanza, in that both involve collecting sets of goods, but while others find this to be a more fiddly game, I think that the added considerations of ducat-points, pirates, cards, and ship movements add to the replay value, and give it a more tactical feel. Rating dropped a rung due to components' lack of clarity (in part due to cute, small size), and the almost-non-functional box it comes in.

The game has a trading flavor similar to Bohnanza, but there is both more and less flexibility due to having a single cargo pile.  There are some incentives and deterrents to trading as well, such as the opportunity to buy cards from the deck and effects on traded cards.  All in all, the theme and complexity lose the silly cuteness factor that endears Bohnanza to certain friends.

I have since traded the game away.

It's a relatively simple euro game that tries to simulate trading goods in the Mediterranean sea. But I don't like it very much.

First most people said the board is useless. It is partially true, it could probably have been replaced with a card mechanic or using a much smaller board.

The second weird thing is that the middle of the game scoring is just annoying because it breaks one of you resource suites (which are already hard to assemble) and makes scoring of prestige tokens asymetric with the scoring of location tokens. Personally, I would remove middle game scoring.

Thirds, there are serious balance issues in this game. Some goods are apparently more valuable because there is less of that good type, but if you want my point of view, they are worth shit, because they allow you to play so few cards that playing them takes so many actions. So you will make much more money trying to assemble a large suit of cards which are worth less, but it the end give you more income more rapidly since there is more copies of each cards and since you can play more cards. At least in bonanza, when you assembled a group of Cocoa bean, you got a large reward, here you get almost nothing.

Fourth, one of the annoying thing about it, is that it's a kind of game where you need to check various elements at the same time, and if you change 1 variable, you need to recalculate all the other elements to make sure it works. This is because, each card played influence: the actions executed, you max hand size for next turn, the number of cards played on the next turn and the combination with cards already played to make series.

There is some similarities with bonanza, but personally I prefer bonanza much better.

RATING: 6
It's an interesting game of managing ducats (VPs), card resources and trading, which only bears some very minor resemblence to Bohnanza (very different game).  Just like the negotiations in Traders of Genoa, bartering might extend the game length by 10-15 mins. but this is a nice medium-weight game involving hand mgt. I was more impression in my first couple of plays than my last few.  

Update:  As I play this a few more times, I realize it had less appeal thing my initial impressions.

Nice plastic, 3-D ship models in the line of Pirates!  Seems a bit overboard for the type of game though...:-)  Typical Ornella game in that the cards play many different roles in the game in well over 5 aspects (immediate scoring/money, delayed scoring set collection, pirates/losing points, drawing more cards, number of actions, and ship movement.  It is always interesting to see how much Ornella interweaves card play into his games.  Another interesting twist is the trading aspect that is also available in this game which throws a bit of a wrench into play.

There's something about the game -- whether, it's the order in which you move around the board and pick up tokens; or the fact that you have to be careful about which cards you bury and in which order -- but the game seems so random and chaotic and yet, so tactical and strategic at the same time. I haven't played it enough to really figure it all out, but I definitely know it rates high.

At first I was worried when I opened the box (The Mind The Move Edition) that I was getting 'too much game', it looked like he was trying to throw in all his ideas at once.  But after a couple of games it is clear that  Ornella (a designer to watch) has made a game where you have to make difficult choices throughout.  The board has been criticized as being superfluous but this ignores the strategical decisions you need to make when moving about the board.  A good game which needs a few more plays to give a fair ranking but should level out around the 7 to 8 mark.

A charming game, which changes a lot depending what kind of players you're playing it with. With  highly competitive players the game can become quite intense, almost up to the level of games like Puerto Rico, even though Oltremare is a significantly simpler game. With a more mellow crowd, the game is still quite entertaining. In both cases, the game manages to keep from becoming repetitive, although you might think otherwise based on the gameplay description. All in all, I like the game and I'm happy I bought it.

AFTER ONE PLAY:

When the rules were being read to us, the gaming group was very excited to play what seemed like a deep game, with lots of skillful trading and negotiation.  Unfortunately, there wasn't enough player interaction, except for the trades, which were usually declined because of the hand-limit or number-of-cards-that-must-be-played limit.  Not to mention the awarding of prestige points to the non-active player involved with a trade.

Nice productin, decent components (with the exception of the terrible ship tokens... not as nice as Pirates of the Spanish Main, and barely distinguishable in terms of color, even for the non-color-challenged).  

I need to try it again for sure, but have a feeling my rating will sink lower even still.  I was guessing my rating was going to be an 8, but the trading sucked dog poo.

Tentative rating after one 3-player game. Oltremare is similar to Bohnanza, with less interaction amongst players, with an elegant action system. The board is not very important as the different harbors let you take somem special-effect counter and nothing else. Could have been implemented better, but still a very clever game. And gorgeous graphics.

Picked Up July 2006

This is an easy game to get in to, tho slightly fiddly. I like it but there didn't seem to be a great need for trading in our game since there are so many goods cards available. Felt like there was something missing but not sure what. It isn't the Settlers replacement I was hoping for, but we need to play it some more. Perhaps because we played with 3. The Bohnanza comparison isn't really accurate. There are some shared elements in the scaled scoring depending on number of cards played but the overall feel is quite different. Plays with 5. I expect this is will be a keeper once we get a better handle on it.

Good with two players, although the trading aspect is a bit subdued. It becomes a very good game with more, but possibly favors the starting player a bit - the new endgame rules in the Amigo version get rid of this problem.

2-5p, 60m.  Predecessor to Il Principe.  Some compare it to Bohnanza, but with a nautical [pirate?] trading theme, and more complex interactions.

Neat little game, have the mind the move version and I love the portability. What an amazing little release. There is tons of game cramed into this box.

I like bidding games and this one is fun. The board doesn't really seem necessary, but it doesn't make the game worse. (Ships move to collect tokens that aid in some way - more movement, more VPs, less pirate stacks etc...) Stack sets of the same type of treasure to increase your score, but also increases your odds of getting pirate cards. I had a very lucky night and did extremely well. A fun balance of luck and some strategy. Not too heavy and seems like a great, but overlooked gateway game.

I can't say there's anything wrong with this game, but the decisions do not vary much. This, in itself, is not an issue. I feel like the game goes on about twice as long as it should for the variation of decisions present.

I almost feels like it's a light game trying to be a medium weight game, but it's artificially doing it.

Only played once.  A great little game.  The box is much smaller than I expected.  If all games were packaged this way I would hate to see how many games I would have in my collection today... lol

Lots of game in a small package.  A really neat blend of many other popular games.  The game may go on just a touch too long if people really drag each trading phase out.

I do wish a few rules would have been a little clearer.

The special power which lets you buy cards for cheaper seems a bit off balance... Buying one or two cards provides a savings.  Buying a third card is the same as the standard price.  Buying a fourth card costs one more than everyone else (4 instead of 3).  I guess you save two dollars in total if you buy four cards but I don't understand why anyone would do this.

Also, I was the last player.  After taking gold, I could only draw one more card in the pirate phase even though I was supposed to take three or six.  How does this get resolved?  Do you get a deal just for being last or should you just subtract the difference from your score?

At any rate I hope to play this again soon.

I've played the Amigo/RGG second edition 12 times. I found it to be an enjoyable game that I look forward to playing again many times. The graphics are a bit on the drab side, but serviceable. Sometimes there's a problem with players confusing goods colors as the cloth, scrolls, and salt are basically three shades of blue, and the grain's pale yellow and pottery's tan are also too close together.  

10/12/10 Caveat: played my first five-player game. Two negatives. First, even though it didn't actually take any longer, it seemed to take twice as long. In a nutshell the downtime got to me. Second, several times two or three players were going for the same goods. And whoever was later in the turn order got screwed. I think I'll stick to 3 & 4 player games from now on. 
03/05/13 Played another five-player game. Same experience - I was the third guy looking for pottery (then silk, then grain) and of course I got screwed every time. 10/29/13 Played another five-player game. I think the only reason I did better this outing was the two newbies did poorly. 
03/31/15 Played a five-player game in 71 minutes. I noticed no appreciable downtime. I think we were lucky we had no slowpokes this time. 
03/08/16 Played a five-player game in 55 minutes.

Game in a Nutshell: Bohnanza on 'roids. Take the same heart of trading, slap on some fluctuating variables that vary according how you manage you hand, and spice it up with actions that need to be played out depending on the cards you lay out.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Out of the box, you can't help but love the cute ships and excellent components all around. The amount of things that is built into each card makes even the most basic card-for-card trade hard to value but most of all interesting. The game itself keeps things fair throughout and will score you based on how you play at any given point. 

Cons: Simply put... the scoring track. The heart of this game and what drives it is the trading. Strip the trading out of it and it's boring, non-interactive and probably rated a 3 out of 10 overall. What the scoring track does is let people know who's winning and shut them out of the trading market because no-one wants to potentially help the leader. So essentially, if you're the one being denied the trading market, it can become a drag. Outside of that, the theme doesn't stand out and things might look dry and mechanical.

Other: Seriously, I'd love to see a blind scoring mechanic here similar to Ra or Tigris and Euphrates. Heck, even Bohnanza, the game most comparable to this, made it hard to track the winner and encourage fair trading beginning to end. Other then that, it's a great fleshed-out trading game and logical step up in weight from trading beans. I think it played nice with three and would love to try with more in hopes that there would be love and cards to go around.

Best Use: For a group that likes the interaction of trade and a nice mix of optimization to keep you thinking.

They took the best part of Bonhanza (zany trading/set collection), stripped out its worst parts (scripted/forced trading), added a layer of strategy and made a game out of it: Oltremare. I like the way each card forces you to decide between several appealing options, the mechanism of trying to keep several cards in your hand vs having several actions to play. However the myriad options means that slower players/deep thinkers will have a ball slowling the game to a crawl, hence my lower score.

10-2006  Excellent pick up and collect game with an interesting scoring system.  Cards are played into a stack scoring points at the end of the game based on grouped commodities (goods) collected (cards in a row).  The goods cards also determine which actions & bonuses available for next turn.  A small sized, well-balanced game with a ton of tough decisions.

8-29-2011 UPDATE: 2nd time through 5 years later and it's not as great as I remember.  Perhaps it was the hard luck that was handed to me or just the lackluster excitement at the table.  Bumped rating down .75.

RATING: 5
Very over-packaged (at least in the newest edition) card game, probably the most severe offender of this trait that I'm aware of. The huge box and large board make you think that the game will involve some kind of significant action sailing around the Mediterranean and making trades at various harbors, but it doesn't. Almost the entire game is played out with a deck of cards no larger than you'd use for a game of Canasta, and is rather abstract and dry given the highly thematic bits, art, and board. 

I was reminded of Hansa while playing Oltre Mare, but I think Hansa pulls off a very similar trick (pairing up sets of like-colored goods, traveling around the seas making trades, tying up long-term victory points and short-term positional improvements in an interesting and interactive way, etc) much much better. Maybe if Oltre Mare didn't advertise itself through the box and board as anything other than a card game, the comparison to the much more robust Hansa wouldn't be so disappointing.

Trade cards with fellow players, then play cards into your cargo space, with the top card dictating how many cards you can hold and play. Cards played determine how much money you earn, how many pirates you get, how many cards you replenish and how many spaces you can move on the board to accumulate harbors. Points are scored for money, sets of cards, negative points for pirates, and majority points for trading and harbors. Though on the lighter side of things, I think this game is worth it's hype from Essen. It's fairly easy to play, encourages trading and it is fun. I have played the first edition and the updated edition; the updated edition does equalize turns for all players before the game ends.

I liked the game when it came out. Now I revisited this game again and... well, it is just too much going on. There are some neat ideas but not well executed.

Trading mechanics is kind of strange because whoever trades with the active player get prestige markers that counts towards some bonus points. so this actually decreases some incentive of trading...

RATING: 5
(2nd edition) Wow, this got old really quick.  Ostensibly, it's a game about trading goods, but that aspect of the rules is barely functional.  Player A's turn might take ten seconds because it's programmed based on the cards in his hand, while Player B's turn might take ten minutes because he desperately needs to trade away cards that nobody wants.  Worst of all, Player C's turn might be just like Player A's, but first he has to wait until Player B finally works something out or just gives up.  I want more compelling negotiations in a game of this nature.

I hate Bohnanza but I like this. I find Bohnanza a game of begging with no real control other than if you can whine loud enough to get sympathy from the other players. Oltremare puts the trading on a more strategic level, while adding needed machanics to add some skill to the proceedings.

You are trying to get multiple groups of cards, the more you get the more points you get. Getting pirates is not as bad as it seems. In the end it seems that if you can get enough cards out without having to pay for them you'll be better off. I think the penalty for buying cards is worse than taking pirates.

RATING: 7
First impression (4 players): It's a game about hand management and trading. You want to have similar products in your trade pile but sometimes you must think about playing "wrong" cards too because of getting good bonuses of playing sets of bonus icons on cards. I like the mechanic how the topmost card in this pile affects your next round quite a lot (hand limit, how many cards you play). A trading game even I liked.

Played many times but only 2 player game. In 2 player game trading becomes obsolete and we do not trade at all, somehow it does not make any sense. But nevertheless, the game is attractive with the right time for that what it offers. Though it inherits some game elements from Bohnanza, but the game play is different. I would play it always, but probably after 5 plays without any break I would suggest some other game.

Great game! This game sat on the shelf unplayed for awhile, simply because it looks rather dull and unassuming. I had read it was similar to Bohnanza, researched it before purchasing and suspected it would be fun to play...and it is! 

A great weeknight medium weight game that is nicely strategic! The mechanics of trading cards is similar to Bohnanza, but unique in it's card design! And moving around the board is simply to collect tokens that give you a special power until you use it! All in all a unique game experience that I feel is different from any other in my collection! Forget about the dull look and title and enjoy playing the game!

RATING: 6.5
Have finally played this, but was only two player, which really didn't help the trading aspects of the game. Maybe if I get the chance to play again with more players, my rating might improve.

Played a 3 player game today. It was better than 2, but the trade aspect of the game wasn't really there again. I can't see how this game encourages trading. You are forced to remove excess cards from your hand & it cost 3 Ducats a card to get more. This being the case, I can't see how players are going to have a large collection of cards in their hand to trade. That might be different in a 5 player game, but I can't see me getting the chance to get 5 players playing this, so I think that it's up for trade.

Have played another 3 player game today. I can see that there is something there, but it really does need 4-5 players & I rarely, if ever, get that number of players together.

A German-style game with trading, hand-management, and set collection. More of a card game with a minor board mechanism. Nice feel to gameplay. A good Light-Medium game for your money. The main strategy is to set up to maximize your tactics through set building, and action symbol compiling. Penalties/costs for buying too much, and having too many cards in your pirate card pile.

Better with 3 or more players. 2 players is just okay. Too long to be just a filler.

Rulebook a little fiddly.

What I like:
- Clever game design, with interwoven mechanisms
- Very portable (Mind-the-Move Edition)

What I don't like:
- Difficult to teach, for its weight
- Seems long for what it is (I would always leave out the wheat)
- Much more fun with trading, but that requires the players to know the game, and will make it even longer

The Mind the Move edition components are quite good.

Apparently the mid-game scoring in the RGG edition includes scoring your cargo, whereas the Mind the Move edition only gives out the Prestige bonus, keeping cash tighter.

I think the BGG weight of 2.5 is about right, although it seems more complex at first.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: A simple card based game where you try and make sets, but also have to manage your hand and your discard stack. Based on the cards you get, you play as many as required and try to keep them in sets by trading (feels a little like Bohnanza). Fairly light without a lot of down time. Maybe good for your non-gamer crowd also.

RATING: 6
A lot of fun to play. Best when played with 4 to 5 players to fully benifit from trading mechanic. Only critisim is that there is no real way to "zing" your opponents other than lying to them about what exactly is on the card you are trading.

RATING: 8
This is an excellent trading/negotiation game, similar to Bohnanza, but a little more in-depth, and without quite as much trading.  On some level this game becomes an exercise in cost analysis, as drawing cards is expensive, but you need them to keep your engine going and to have trade fodder.  The pirates are interesting, as they give you cards that you must pay to draw before the end of the game, or face penalties.  So it really doesn't hurt to get them, but you do want to keep them under control.  Trading on other people's turns gives you a bonus, so you really don't want to trade on your turn unless it's necessary.  I generally don't like free-for-all negotiation games, but I do enjoy Oltre Mare--it doesn't go overboard with the trading, and there are tons of interesting decisions.

RATING: 7
First 2-player trial game was a 7. Took about 1/3 of the game before having a reasonable understanding of how it all works, especially using the numerous pirate actions to advantage (or not disadvantage). The pirate harbour seems to be the place to be for much of the game. Rating might well go up with 3  players as trading will be much more active and competition for harbours more intense. 4-player got uprated to an 8.

It plays slowly because there is so much to think about when using this turn to plan for the next turn. The Prestige points for trading are a bit more chrome than needed and can be a bit fussy to track unless separate chits are used.

Update: Not knowing where a player stands until the final scoring costs a ratings point. This makes playing pretty close to parallel solitaire.

A decent trading/collecting card game. In the original The map distracts from play, the larger map in the 2nd ed worked better. However the boats are hard to tell at a glance I've substituted pawns. 
Did like the negative point concept impacted by what you play and your hand limits. It forces you to trade off turns for actions and points to recover from an over extension.

I really wanted to like this game because the first edition is so compact.

PROS: 
* Stack management is lots of fun
* Trading isn't as straightforward; a particular card you want may have some icons that you don't want. Being allowed to lie about these icons is fun at times.
* Interesting potentials for long-term planning in the form of special powers you may collect throughout the game.

CONS: 
* Very strict hand limits coupled with high card variety. You simply can't perform elaborate stack management operations unless you have the right cards. This in turn limits long term planning.
* The game is way too long for the very sparse decision tree (made sparse by the strict hand limits). If I'm playing a game this long, I want to make a lot of meaningful decisions throughout the game.

Not a bad little game, but I am not sure I like the negotiation element in this game. It's necessary for the game to work, but I feel that there is a lot of information to process. You think you're trading for an olive card - but there's so many other pieces of information on the same card. Considering all of them would be information overload, but it does affect the value of the cards. The board element seems unnecessary. I don't know - I kind of wanted to like it, and I hate to say that it was too complicated, because it really wasn't. Still, seems like there was too much going on.

The most elegant trading game that I have come across. The mechanics work very well and the playing time is max. 1-1,5 h even if there are some trading and negotiations involved. Really nice special power system. There are different strategies you can try to use and it's not all about luck. Good negotiaton skills and well planned actions is the key in winning the game. You can't win on your own. Some lucky/unlucky swings may happen but you can always improve your situation if you are a good negotiator or others just fall for your promises. 4- player game is probably the best. 5-player game tends to end too quickly since the draw deck runs out faster. All in all the gameplay just flows very smoothly and it is always fun to play Oltre Mare.

I'm all for 1) saving paper and cardboard by making cards serve multiple purposes, and 2) saving shelf space by making a game as compact as possible yet still playable.

Rating based on 2 player game. Perhaps with more players it is better, with just 2 of us trading just did not happen. The game was just boring to me. And there seemed no reason at all for the game board, all you do is move and collect the token you land on. The token gives you a small benefit until you move and collect a new token, then the old token is inactive and the new token is active.  It's like they created the board just so it wasn't just a card game.

Basically you're trying to build a stack of resources in sequential sets while avoiding too much piracy, which deducts from your score. There is a map of the Mediterranean to move your ship around to collect special tokens, which honestly seems like an unnecessary addition. The card aspect is enough to make a full game. But I guess they wanted to add more of the flavor of the old Venetian mercantile empire.

Similar to Bohnanza, but with more chrome and complexity. I think most players will feel like they have more control here, but in the end I reckon Bohnanza is less random (if more opaque). Depends how much of a game theory nerd you are.

The board is pretty redundant, though. You could (for example) just use a bag and draw one chit per ship icon, keep one and return the rest. If you're stuck with the same one as your old chit, remove the drawn chit from the game and take the null power.

After a "three-player" solitaire game, I give it a provisional 7.5. A surprising number of interesting mechanisms are in Oltremare. My favorite has to be prestige points, to encourage more active trading: during of the game, prestige points are awarded to every player for every turn in which they trade with the active player. All prestige points are cashed in at midpoint and then game end, where the player with the most points gets 6 ducati (gold/VPs), and second and third places get 3 and 1 ducati respectively. What a great little mechanism to encourage folks who might not normally trade. Anyhow, this is a cute set collection game, in which you create a stack of cards, and score points for "runs" of goods in the same "suit." The stack cannot be altered once cards are placed there. That's the main way you earn points, but there are other ways, and it's possible these other ways will produce more ducati than a good cargo stack. You have to contend with pirates, stock shortages, stock surplus, and ship movement. The ship itself is somewhat unnecessary, as it's only used to give you one of several special powers until the next time you move your ship. The map adds a little flavor and gradually decreases the availability of the "harbor markers" that contain these special powers. With the right cargo, these powers can have a dramatic effect on your score, so I'm not suggesting the harbors be removed but perhaps a whole map isn't necessary to represent these effects. In any case, I'm babbling, it's an interesting game. Strategizing in this game requires you to solve for x, y, and z simultaneously, so every play feels like a balancing act. If I add these three wine casks to my cargo stack it'll pay me the best profit, but then I'll have to put two cards in my pirate stack and discard most of my hand next turn and I'll also have to move my ship which will make me lose my ducati bonus ... but if I play it THIS way (etc). Interesting, definitely worthy of a play with real folk but I suspect there are some issues I haven't unearthed yet.

This is what "Bohn-hansa" (Bean Trader) should have been.  The cards manage to pack a lot of mechanics into a small space, and the trading works wonderfully, despite only having two real resources.

RATING: 6
The king of hand management games.  Appears fussier than it is; most of the systems interlock in interesting ways that are not necessarily obvious on first play.  I am especially impressed that trading is heavily incentivised without resorting to bullying the players into doing it.  I always forget to buy off my pirate stack!  But yes, Virginia, the board /is/ too small in the original edition.

RATING: 7
This was a distinctly pleasant little game.  While the majority of its final scoring is reminiscent of Bohnanza, that is the most significant similarity to that game.  I find that you have much more control, with it being less likely for people to make otherwise silly trades.  In fact, the prestige bonuses for making trades seems to almost encourage trading too much.  There were several times I considered passing up placing a good for the possibility of the prestige points.  All in all, there were quite a few difficult decisions to make.  Granted, it took us a couple of rounds to get the system worked out, but once we did, we were able to run with it.  A lot of fun.

Oltre Mare (Mind the Move small box edition) -- Played three-, four-, and five-player.  I really enjoy this at three and four.

Original small box edition -- While not as slick as the Rio Grande edition, the original edition is still of good quality. The Harbor markers are a bit difficult to tell apart, and it's too easy to accidentally shift the summary card marking your prestige, but those are quibbles. Our games are usually tight -- until the last moment, we can't be sure who will win. Some of the mechanics are reminiscent of Bohnanza (managing card order), Mamma Mia! (remembering cards played to a stack), and even Settlers (trading), but this game has its own feel, and the various mechanics mesh well. I had heard that the board was relatively useless -- I disagree. Part of the board strategy is to take routes which will give you the Harbor marker you need (or to avoid sailing, so you can keep the marker you have), while also trying to ensure other markers are within reach.

[i]Update 28 June 2009:[/i] Finally played a five-player session of Oltre Mare.  Disappointed.  I had hoped that more players would open up more trade opportunities, but that wasn't the case.  More importantly, I felt that each player did not have enough turns for the game's balancing mechanisms to work.  The depletion of the goods deck ends the game.  In a five-player game, the goods deck can diminish rather quickly between turns.

Note to self:  During game-end scoring, cards in the Pirate stack only cost one ducat each.  This Provides some incentive during play to buy cards from your own Pirate stack rather than the goods deck, [i]but only when purchasing cards is [u]required[/u][/i].  Do not purchase them simply to deplete your Pirate stack, as they'll cost more to purchase during play than they will at game-end.  Furthermore, if the cards lost to the Pirate stack were originally obtained not by purchase but by action symbols, then the game-end penalty is the [i]only[/i] cost to the player (and a rather minor one, at that.)

If someone complains that their Pirate stack is huge, take note of how the cards in the stack were initially obtained.  Did the player purchase them?  Then the Pirate stack represents a potentially significant loss.  Did the player gain them through the use of the card symbols?  Then don't be fooled.  The stack actually represents  that player's history of abundance.

Oltre Mare (Rio Grande edition) -- Played three-, four-, and five-player.  I really enjoy this at three and four.

Rio Grande edition -- Beautiful components all around. And some real improvements in a couple areas: Negative markers for when your score drops below zero, and prestige tiles to replace the need to keep a card in place on the original prestige scale. Sadly, there are some flaws as well: the colors of two commodities (Wheat and Pottery) are so close that I had a great deal of trouble telling them apart without fanning my hand enough to see the symbols. To a lesser degree, this was also a problem for Scrolls, Satin, and Salt. This could be corrected by changing the colors or (better yet) by adding a symbol index to the top left corner of each card. Also, the player colors are very hard to discern on the ships' sails. 

Our games are usually tight -- until the last moment, we can't be sure who will win. Some of the mechanics are reminiscent of Bohnanza (managing card order), Mamma Mia!

One of a number of Euro-type games about trading with a serious-looking chap on the box and a rather dull board.

Trading, Hand Management, Set Collection. I really enjoyed this. It pleasantly combines trading (like Settlers of Catan), mandatory set collection (like Bohnanza), and hand/money management to produce a light middleweight game that was pretty fun once we got into it. I can see this being a "gateway +1" game for people who like Settlers; I intend to try it out on some soon to find out!

Traded. Too many games, not enough time.

Nos mai két kereskedős játék után teljesen egyértelmű számomra, hogy ez a része a társasjátékoknak nem tetszik. Ezeknél a játékoknál a meggyőző képesség nagyon sokat jelenthet. Az Oltre Mare pedig erősen kereskedős játék, ha nem is annyira mondjuk, mint a China Town. Bár a játékszabály még serkenti is a játékosokat a cserére, hisz két értékelésnél is számít, ki mennyit kereskedett. A Bohnanzához hasonlítják, nem véletlenül, de azért teljesen más a játék. Egyrészt egy kupacba gyűjtjük az áruinkat, fajtánként egyszerre minél többet másrészt a hajózások is sokat jelentenek a játékban, ami a Bohnanzában nem található meg. A játéknak van memória része is, tudni kell mennyi azonos fajta árut gyűjtöttünk eddig, mennyi és milyen áru van a kalózpaklinkban. Ez a része sem szimpatikus igazán, bár el kell ismerni azért nem olyan nehéz ezeket észben tartani. Ami igazán rontja a játékot a szememben az az, hogy elég egyértelmű a stratégia. Minden körben minél több kártyát játsszunk ki. Még ha sok kalózkártyát is szedünk be, az a játék végén értékelődik is és csak 1-1 mínuszpont jár darabjáért. Bőven több ponthoz jutunk a sok kártya kijátszása által. A játék kivitelezése teljesen rendben van. A játékosok hajóit nehéz csak megkülönböztetni egymástól egyedül ennyi róható fel hibájának e téren. Nem az én játékom az Oltre Mare, de objektíven sem tartom igazán jó játéknak. Ehhez a témához pont elég a kevésbé komoly Bohnanza vagy China Town. Nem tetszett.

This is a really great hand management trading game.  There is certainly a little Bohnanza in that you must play certain cards from your hand and ultimately you want to multiply the point value by matching types.  In addition, you have to try to trade before you ruin the point spread with dud cards.  But really there is so much more game going on here than with Bohnanza (I hate Bohnanza but love this).  There is board movement, controlling pirates, taking advantage of bonuses, and dealing with a variable hand size vs number of cards you can play.    All in all a great game, with clear art and design on the cards.  Wonderful indie release, a must own.

Enjoyable card-driven trading game.  I like that you're trying to make combinations and the trading aspect is the best part of this one.  There is a nice mechanic to encourage trading by giving prestige (and having bonus points based on the most prestige earned).   It is a pretty game and does have a nice balance between decision-making and player interaction.  In fact, I might be ranking this a bit low.

UPDATE: Not so much.  I'm moving this down to a 6, as I find this game to be incredibly frustrating.  It seems that I should like the game more, but I just find it frustrating.

Picked this game up so cheap I was bothered by the rather low ranking on BGG. Have to say I prefer Oltre Mare to Bohnanza, and it really is an under-rated game.

Economic card games are right up my alley and I'd like to play this one again soon, partially because I think I'll like it even more once I delve deeper into the game and also while the rules are still fresh in my head!

If you like Bohnanza, you will probably like this game as it incorporates the card trading of Bohnanza with some board game mechanics.  You are buying/selling/trading commodities but need to keep a balance in the way the cards are played because what you play on one turn influences what you can do on your next turn.  All-in-all and enjoyable game that plays fairly quickly.

A clever trading game that contains hints of both Bohnanza (card scoring) and Mamma Mia (memory element) in it.  I marvel at the card design, where the images are clear and uncluttered, and are organized in the order in which the turn phases occur.  My only nits are that the counters are too small, and some games tend to drag out a bit long, but overall I'm very satisfied with this game.

Played once.  Decently fun light/medium game.  The stuff on the board felt somewhat extraneous and random (all 3 players started in same spot and first player was able to keep 2nd from getting bonuses).  Card collection was kept interesting by balance on cards (hand size, cards playable, and actions).  Is in a range of games that are a little too fiddly and long for the amount of strategy present.

I bought it because it's about renaissance Venice and trading. I like trading games as some luck aspect can be removed by trading (between those with less luck), and in this case, trading with the active player might even give you an additional edge.
Does not play well with less than four people (not because of the mechanics themselves but because it comes down to luck, lacking possible trading partners).

An older title from a designer who never fails to show up on my radar. I've had this game for a couple of years now. I picked it up for a couple of bucks in Essen one year, but I only got around to reading the rules last week.
Like similar titles from it's time (think [thing=8989][/thing]) it has simple, short rules, a limited component set and streamlined game play with enough depth to entertain the strategic player.
I'm not sure how many different strategies there are to explore, but I do think it's a game that can have it's place in my collection fore a while. It's very streamlined and it doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Granted I am dealing with one play but first impressions can also be important.  I felt stuck in a scenario of being behind and every turn only increasing that loss.  I had few cards, no money to purchase more, and no means of reversing my fortune.  If it hits the table again I will give it another try - but I certainly won't be putting it on my wish list yet.

After over a year it hit the table again - I still won't be going out of my way to get it, but this time I felt I had a little more control of the situation.

Still not sure what to think about this game.  The trading seems to ancillary to the card play.  Often, "trading" will come down to players donating cards to get prestige tokens.  If there were fewer ware types, there might be actual competition over commodities, but often the symbols on the cards are just as, if not more important.

There's quite a bit to consider in this card-driven game. Hand management, trading, timing of card play, etc., all require some thought and present some wonderfully agonizing decisions. Very meaty - and good - game in a refreshingly small box. Update: original small-box edition was great on the wallet, but the new Rio Grande Games edition is beautiful! Interestingly, I echo some other folks here who dislike Bohnanza but enjoy Oltre Mare ... the trading is far more balanced here ...

At least with two players, luck can be a very big factor. You can mitigate a lot of it, but then you will need to take time planning and that is boring for everyone else. Would have needed more player interaction to be really good.

Oltre Mare is a clever card game, and then there happens to be this board sitting alongside.  Stacking your own freight deck with like sets is brilliant.

This is the game that I have owned the longest without ever playing.

It was one of the first games I bought when I got into the hobby in 2007 and there it has sat.  I have soloed it three times to get the rules down in preparation for playing, but sadly when the time comes it doesn't make it to the table.  

I do think I'll enjoy it, I like it's portability (I have the original version) so it stays in the collection.  I really do want to play it I just have a harder time getting card games to the table than I do boargames.

Update: I've had this 9 years and still not a single play. I'm 43 years old and I have never seen E.T. Which "record" will fall first?

RATING: 7
Sits pleasingly higher on the complexity scale than Bohnanza, while utilizing enough familiar mechanics to make the latter a good tool for grooming new Oltremare players.  Still, the gameplay is enough to make me pick my company carefully, as the different elements on each card intertwine across one's hand to lace the game's hand management with complexity.  I also think this makes it trickier to teach.  The Amigo version is beautiful, with absolutely top-notch components.

Nice little, quick, light, easy to teach trading game.  I like it with more players as it opens up more possibilities for trading and you can be cunning and get rid of those pirates!

(2 plays) Interesting, though the trading element (at least in my group) seemed rather pedestrian; the card play all interlocks, making things a little interesting, but I'm not convinced there's much strategic depth here. The new production is much better component-wise than the original small box, though I do think they could have made the ship colors more prominent.

RATING: 8
Good mechanics, great components, plays fast. Players need at least one game to get the strategy of the game. It is hand management at its best!

RATING: 7
[thing=13551][/thing] is a set collection game, much like [thing=11][/thing], where the more of a given resource (salt, grain, olive, cloth, and others), more you gain in points. The game also uses hand management and movement for your ship.

There are many things to consider in the game, as every card has 3 informations: the number of cards you can have in your hand at the start of your next turn, the number of cards you will have to play, and also a number of symbols (coin, ship, pirate and card), and the more of a symbol you have in the cards you play in the turn, more of that action takes effect (like: if you play only one coin symbol, you gain 1 coin, but if you play two cards with the symbol, you gain 3, if three cards, you gain 6 coins).

It is a really neat thing - and you surely has to think at least one turn ahead (because the cards you play, and in which order, affects your next turn, as the last card played will say the number of cards you can have in hand and how many cards you will be able to play). The game also has negotiation between players, you can trade cards with other players, to gain more cards of the same type, in order to gain more points.

It appears to be a hard game to learn, but really isn't - once you play it, you will see it is really easy and straightforward - a whole game took us around one hour!

The game bits are good: the card stock is OK and the board does the job. The best part is the ships (which you must assemble) that makes the game looks so much nicer.

I'm glad to have played it and I'm looking forward to play it again.

RATING: 6.5
Fresh trading game, with some cool moving parts. The trading - while not constant - is prevalent and often quite funny. Spotting when an opponent has to trade, discussing the pros and cons of the goods. The board is somewhat incidental, but it also informs decisions and helps to map out a strategy for players. And the design of the card system is just very clever. I'd say this captures the feel of an opportunistic trader rolling around the Mediterranean as much as I'd like a game to.

Something about the look of this game, the box, the components, make me like it, or want to like it. I haven't tried it with more than two players, but I like the way it flows. I'm just not sure that the cards drawn don't make it too luck-based.

Decent game with three, very low trading, unlike Bohnanza...but probably better with more people

This game puzzles me. It looks like it is better, but really, it is just a souped up Bohnanza. I like the continuous stack mechanism and the countback for the pile, but the ports feature feels tacked on to beef up the game. Puzzling

RATING: 7.5
O.K.  I am reeling from my first game.

I had skimmed the setup of the rules, but since we didn't think it was complicated game, we just read the rules aloud, repeating some sections several times to make sure we got it right, and started playing.  This game needs better instructions and a player aid.  I took forever to get the hang of it, but once I did, it was a much meatier game than expected.

I have heard a lot of comparisons to Bohnanza but trading is central to that game and just one minor option among many in Oltremare.  I think people will get more out of the game if they approach it without beans on the brain.

I had some issues with brain lock a couple of times, but I think that was just me being a little dense.  I was evaluating my options much more coherently at the end, so I hope my next play is faster, or that will be another negative.  It definitely gets points off for the tiny board, though.

Seems to be equally liked and hated, and not receiving a lot of plays, lately. Bohnanza comparisons seem to hurt the game rating. Bohnanza being a highly rated favorite; yes, this makes perfect sense. If you don't find this funner than Settlers and Ticket to Ride combined, then you aren't playing it right. [gameid=7709].

A very elegant game, with a few distinct strategies and boat loads of luck.. Semplicemente delizioso! Bravo, Emanuele Ornella!

Certainly brings to mind Bohnanza, which is a favourite of mine.  Oltremare is more complex - more bits, more phases to a turn, more information on the cards.  Deeper, though lacking the elegance of the bean game.   Perhaps less fun, as on the evidence of one play only (with 4) it seems there is less incentive to trade, since players have fewer cards in hand and more reason to make the best of them. Would have been an easier first game with a player aid listing the phases of the turn and the harbour marker usage by phase.

One game with four newbies. It took of course a little bit long, but surely will be faster in the future. The game is rather simple and should work with non-hardcoregamers as well. Someone said that it is the board game version of Bohnanza, but of course there are other mechanics as well.

The Lion tokens (trade tokens) are very easy to forget, they are there to encourage players to trade, but it is too easy to forget to take them.

It's a weird blend of Bohnanza and ... well, SOMEthing.  I'm not sure what else.  But the trading/values/stacks/groups thing reminded me a lot of Uwe's game, just with a bit more strategery involved.  It's intriguing, if a little difficult to judge off of one play.  It was definitely worth the bargain-basement price I paid for it.

Cleverly builds upon the "ordered" collecting and "only with active player" trading of Bohnanza, interleaving collection of several other in-game currencies. Great fun if you want a light-ish trading/negotiation game. Despite moving your ships around on a board, this isn't really a route planning game at all. Subsequent plays have downgraded this significantly, because I think it lasts much too long for what it offers, and the moving about of the bits on the board is likewise too fiddly for what it offers.

More thinky Bohnanza and without the mathy endgame of Chinatown!  I really like the tough decisions the interactions of the symbols cause in your hand management and unlike Bohnanza I never felt like had to make a trade or I was doomed... however it also is a little hard to explain than Bohnanza and is much less portable so it didn't stay in my collection.  Still a solid trading game but I still wish the cool little ships did a little more...

Interesting concepts, but there's just a bit too much going on for my tastes. I think the game could have been streamlined a bit more, and I also feel the board doesn't matter enough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Ironically for a game that should rely heavily on player trading and negotiating (Oltremare even encourage the action by giving out prestige points as a result) there was actually very little of that going on.  People seemed more interested in attempting to draw the cards they need instead of getting them from others.

I like the hand management and the memory element combined with the set collection aspect.  The harbor markers with the special power does add a bit of variety to the game.  However, I think it played just a tad too long to make it enjoyable, especially for 3-players.  The deck would deplete faster with more, but not necessarily make it quicker.  A delimma to be sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think Oltremare is over-hyped.  People who claim that if you draw a bunch of pirates you'll lose are incorrect.  Doesn't matter; the luck of the draw of goods are what counts. Whoever best arranges their Goods stack will win; the other ways of getting points (most harbor tokens, highest Prestige, etc.) at the end of the game seem to just be window dressing.  

Update: Have bumped this up from a 5.5 to a 7 with more playings.  I enjoy the game and those extra points at mid-game or at the end *might* make the difference between winning and losing.  More plays will tell if this is the case.

I love the ships, love the unnecessarily large board, love the balance between actions and hand limits.  

I think trading is too wide-open, causing people to bicker over adding a point or two onto a trade.  I love this game but it feels like it should have spent a few more weeks in development.

Solid, interesting game.  The last time I was playing, someone asked me to describe the game, and I had a really hard time doing so.  You mainly conduct goods into your freight pile in the most optimal order you can while managing your money, cards, and actions as efficiently as possible.  It also really does work with two players:  It didn't feel much different, other than the acceptance that one player is ahead on prestige, so the other can do well to exploit the position, rather than trying to "catch up" in prestige.

Does this take too long for what it is? Even after you learn how to play and let the last played card to be one that lets/forces you to play several cards next round... even if some of them contain pirates.

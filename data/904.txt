I have the German Hasbro Traumfabrik edition with the real stars and directors from the 30s.  This is a very good low-luck auction game about optimizing the tiles you are able to pick up to win the trophies.  The balance of the "money" you spend going to your opponents is a good one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think the game is called Traumfabrik people, which by the way, doesn't translate into Hollywood Blockbuster.  Thanks though for changing the name of my game to something I don't own for the umpteenth time BGG.

Strong themed auctioning game.

Gameplay consists of four rounds of six "visits" to locations/parties to recruit (bid using contracts) actors, directors, camera people, special effecs, etc. in an effort to complete movie scripts.  Awards are allocated each round for best movie in each movie category, and also at the end of the game for best direction, best picture, and worst picture.

Bidding is interesting in that it's a closed money system, where everything you bid is equally distributed amongst the rest of the players.  Gameplay feels light, but of course there is some subtle strategy (it's a Knizia), and for once, the theme is very strong.

There didn't seem like there was much tension in the auctions or movie making, but perhaps it's meant to be lighter auction fare to complement Knizia's more taut auction games. The punny names and titles were also really annoying. I think the original (Traumfabrik) would be a 6 for me, since at least then you could kind of imagine what the movies would be like and the humor would really shine - instead, I'm left feeling like I'm playing some awful amalgamation of Mad Magazine and Entertainment Weekly.

Verdict: Squirt and Smirnoff Ice

111023 Traumfabrik, Hollywood Blockbuster.  Odds are that if I get my hands on it, it may go up, but first play, I liked it a bit.  I think I like auctions quite a bit, so I am wary of rating auction games too much until I've played it more than once!

I'd play it more if it wasn't the ugly parody pics.

Love the movie theme. Great auction game. One of Knizia's best. I'd rather play the german version due the real actor/movie names, but the uberplay one isn't bad either if you like "Miami Vice" pastel colors. I always have to remind myself in the last round that contracts are victory points too.

This is a fine bidding game with a fixed economy and a fun theme. I'm not a large fan of bidding games, but with a closed economy, you have a good feel for when you are in a position to bid high or stay low. There contention over the exposed tiles, scoring, denial and general tactics. So quite good for the space.

RATING: 8
A fun bidding game, now out in an English version, which extended family members and gamers alike are probably going to enjoy.  The theme is very attractive and I think most people would prefer the modern and jokey production chips and film titles to those of the original and much older ones.

In many ways, it's a typical Knizia bidding game.  It's not as simple, quick or cut-throat as High Society, or as deep as Modern Art or Ra, but it sails though the middle of those in a rather entertaining way and has enough going on to make it fit for those who like to ponder each move carefully.  Sure, it's not as much of a gamer's game as any of the above games, but then the theme and mechanics like the Party mean that it hits a different sort of sweet spot.

Not quite up to the level of Medici, Ra and Modern Art, but still a great game.

RATING: 6.8
A lot of fun although somewhat repetitive on future plays. Perfect length but the board is ridiculously oversized - Might work better as a card game as Razzia is to Ra

I like the game but one of our group (Paul) really hates it. I might pick up again in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
On the surface this seems like it will be similar to RA. Having now played it, it feels quite different. Not as good as RA, but still quite good. I believe this will fit very nicely in the casual gamers slot of my collection, alongside Ticket to Ride/ Carcassonne/ etc, due to the accessible theme and gameplay.

At heart, a set collection auction game.  Balanced in that the winning bid money (contracts) is distributed evenly amongst the other players.  Unbalanced in that the first person to choose for the parties (the player with the most actors/actresses) can actively retain that position (e.g., by choosing the actors/actresses at the parties).  Also slightly unbalanced in that the best movie awards are not given for the best movie [i]that year[/i] but for the best movie so far.

A fun game.  Love the movie titles and actor/actress names (played the US version with fake movie & actor/actress names).  Love the point valuations.  (-1 for Keanu Reeves?  Brilliant!)  Would play again, but I think there are better set collection games and/or better auction games.

Studio film making game. Make films by buying through auction all the requirements of a movie (actors, directors, music, effects etc).

Great Knizia auction game. In my opinion, Knizias best-themed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[Hollywood Blockbuster] It's a Knizia auction game. What more do you need to know?
This is an enjoyable game. Like all other Knizia auction games, it creates a good tension over what to bid for and how much to bid for. There's a nice trade off between finishing movies early (for the  5 bonuses) and waiting for the better tiles (for a better scoring movie and the 10 bonuses at the end).

This one is a very easy game for new players to learn because the strategy is not subtle. Unfortunately, that makes me like it a bit less.

I like the Uberplay version. I haven't seen the original but I can't understand complaints about this version. It's nicely produced and the parodied names always produce a few chuckles. It's better produced than either Modern Art or Medici.
We enjoyed it more using poker chips instead of the cardboard contracts.

Hard to say why this game doesn't excite me much.  I own several other Knizia auction games and enjoy them all.  I like the theme, I like the redistribution of the successful bidder's money between the other players. Somehow, the auctions seem to lack the tension I look for.  I think perhaps there are just a few each game where the outcome is really critical.  Usually there is too much stuff still to come and it is too adaptable.  

I used to own Traumfabrik, with the really evocative golden era Hollywood star and director images.

RATING: 7
I have too many auction games and this one is feeling like my least favorite.  It's a likely candidate to be rated down and traded away.

The promise of the game is its theme.  It sounds like a lot of fun to make movies with mixed up parts.  In reality, once the game starts I don't even notice the theme and just see the numbers.  Maybe that's my fault, but the theme feels transparent.

So what's left is a well designed auction game with a few different ideas.  But I don't like it as much as Ra or Modern Art or Vegas Showdown or the many other auction type games I have.

I have only played this will a 3-4 players, so I'm interested in trying it with more to see if it plays differently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Did not like this. Really dry for a theme that you'd think would be exciting. 

It was amusing seeing "Woody Allen" direct direct a big dumb action movie and trying to create a bad movie with "Keanu Reeves" to win a razzie.
But that is where the fun ended. 

Bid, collect sets, take points, repeat. Not fun
Mechanically I did like the fact that all money bid was divvied up between the other players.

RATING: 8
i'm not much of an auction guy, but i dig this game.  the party stuff can be pretty crazy depending on what gets pulled, but if you took that out of the game i think it would suffer greatly.  i love the theme, and i don't mind the german stuff at all.  i'm not completely sure how skill-based it is, but it's good fun.  still has the possibility to be player-sensitive, forcing the only person with money to run up or outbid someone on something they don't particularly want or need for the sake of the game.  luckily, the game doesn't completely collapse in terms of fun if somebody fails to do that.

Nice movie themed auction game.  Light and plays fast.  One of Knizia's most themed games and has the trademark elegance of his later designs.  Some versions come with a CD of music from the movies depicted in the game.  This adds a nice atmosphere to the game play.  Play best with people who know the films and the actors as they can supplement the golden age feel.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

Jópofa könnyed licites játék, kb. Modern Art szint. Tetszik, hogy valódi filmes nevek vannak benne. Maga a szétosztós licit is ötletes. Az egészről süt, hogy Knizia!! A Kac-Kac kukacban pl. visszaköszön a forgatókönyvek értékeinek elvétele...
Kicsit ormótlan a doboz (2000-es).

Ebben nincs nyerő stratégia...? (Elején pénzre ráülni.) Bár ahhoz túl nagy a szerencsefaktor.

Dream Factory is another blend of the Knizia auction gaming goodness.
It has some similarities with Ra (players bid for sets of tiles), but everyone starts with an (equal) amount of money, and when a player wins an auction, the sum he pays is divided among the others: it is a sort of closed circular economy. The skill obviously lies in making other players overbid, to cash back some money, and find the timing to have lots of money in hand when the decisive auctions are held.
The theme is very funny and enjoyable (certainly better than Ra, and great for non-gamers): this is probably the best themed Knizia game I tried!

Very interesting mechanism. A good game to introduce to non gamers as well. The funny names of the movies and stars draw people in. Raising rating for this game now! ARRRGGHHH!!!! Another name changer. I have Hollywood Blockbuster, not the new Dream Factory version. Edit: now we can select versions. That's a good thing.

Excellently themed excellent bidding game that will likely get on the table.    It *even works with two*.  Which astounds me for a bidding game, but it must be the way bidding is paid for and how it occurrs.  Definite keeper.
The movie theme makes it a great conversation game, and the game isn't too heavy to stop conversation cold.  :)   The fact that the winning bidder's bid is passed out to the other players helps to soften the blow of bid loss, and building up actors and directors on movies is something that people seem to like quite a lot.

Just one play so far but brought favourable comparisons to Colosseum, of which I recently endured a five-player game that seemed to lastt forever. 

This is quick-playing and intuitive largely thanks to the elimination of the trading aspect and no real choice when it comes to scripts to be produced.

It's a game with some very interesting mechanisms going on.  With the fact that all the contracts you spend end up in the hands of the other players, and knowing that after you spend a bunch of contracts you'll have to wait a while to be a contender for the good chips again, it really forces you to pick and choose what you want to go in on.  Nice and light and quick, with a few difficult choices tossed in the mix.

One of my favourite Knizia bidding games.  Similar to Ra, but I much prefer this as you get a constant supply of "money" coming in (rather than having to wait until the next round) and you can see what auction items are coming up in advance, allowing for a little more strategic planning.

RATING: 7
You play the head of a studio bidding on directors, actors, cinematography, effects, and production tiles to collect sets to create movies to earn points. You even earn points for awards at the end of the fourth quarter. A  game. A mainstream non-geek theme combined with some pretty straight forward bidding suggests to me that this game would make a pretty good gateway game.

RATING: 5
Maybe I'm not getting it, but this one was not at all fun during my first play.  It went basically like this: one player would bid all their money and win. The next round would be the same with the player with the most money in hand winning, etc...

A very fun little auction game.  I like the way that the routine is broken up every once in a while by the Party spaces as well.  Takes some balancing to know whether to make big movies slowly, or small movies fast.  The goofy puns in some of the names are quite funny, and just add to the humor.  A very good set of mechanics make this an auction game that anyone can enjoy and compete in quite well.

An interesting and fun auction game that gets bogged down in slow and fiddly play.  When I think back on how the game works, it seems like it should be really fun.  However, my experience with the game has been poor.  I'm simply surprised at it's ranking on BGG; Medici is a considerably better (and easier to play) auction game from Knizia than this one, though some may prefer the them of this one.  I've found the people I play with aren't grabbed by the theme of Hollywood Blockbuster anyway.

Another "bid on random junk and try to get sets" game.  I've yet to find one that strongly appealed to me, but this one is fine.

I've played all three editions and I don't know why some people complain about the Überplay edition.  It's bright and colourful and the quality is great -- I wouldn't have guessed it was made in China.

RATING: 6.25
A neat little game with clever mechanics and VERY tight play. The pun movie names are pretty cute.

After one play - This is a VERY unforgiving game, with only four turns and large point-scoring opportunities available after every turn. I am also atrocious at auction games, as they require quick assessment of rapidly-shifting values. I would certainly play it again to 'get it right' but it will never be one of my favourites.

Knizia is clearly an amazing designer, but I really can't get into his games.

Traumfabrik (w/CD) I gave it an 8 on the first playing.  It moves very quick and I haven't played a game with bidding like that.  Very cool.  Also, I love the theme of it (and so did those I played with).  It dropped to a 7 but back up to an 8.  I like better than Ra.

If you're not careful, one person can make a hit movie from the get-go and take over too easily but other than that, I love the game. Fun theme (even if it is pasted. VERY well pasted!) great auction mechanics and plays fairly quick. Just bag it right so setup doesn't take too long.

RATING: 6
An okay auction game.  Depending on the way the tiles enter the game, you could get really screwed.  Also, don't try to save up the bulk of the contracts in the game... there is never a point that you can collect enough contracts to "run the table" and win several auctions in a row.  Lastly, don't spend most of the game trying to make "the worst" movie... you'll probably make it too early and then someone will tie you and take the next lower chip for an even worse movie.

I'm rating a retheme here, the superbly crafted Starship Inter Prize version by Miggor - www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/45514

I'm sure the base game is pretty much the same tho.

Neat auction game where no money leaves the game as everythign you win in bids is split between the othr players. In The Starship Inter Prize, you get to place captains, crew, engines, cargo pods, crew, and weapons on a number of spaceships. You get points for the best ship of each class and points for the total rating of all the items you placed upon it. Nice simple mechanic and a fun game!

Hey, this was even fun as a 2-player game! I don't know why this Knizia auction game sticks out for me, but I've always enjoyed playing this.  I know that I like games that reward a player that is willing to take a risk on a "good" play over players who want to wait for the "perfect" play, yet maintain an advantage for players that can see the true value of certain combinations.  Unfortunately, the satire of the studios, movies and actors will not age well I'm afraid. (but that will only affect the experience in a pretty minor way).

A couple of plays to date and, while clearly a good game (decisions, tension, etc), it didn't really 'grab' me.

I have Traumfabrik (the "parody" nature of the new one turns me off). The original has got an awesome theme, producing Hollywood's greatest hits from yesteryear. The zero-sum bid mechanic keeps everyone in the game; and when combined with the fact that you can see what's coming up in the next series of auctions, you realize you have a whole lot of control of what you're going to be able to bid on the lots that are important to you. However, the game loses a lot with less than 5 players - 4 is OK, but 3 is not recommended.

[b]Hollywood Blockbuster[/b] is a classic Reiner Knizia game with auctioning at it's heart of game play.  It's a very light game and is easy to teach, and the components are fun too - the awards are cardboard cutouts on plastic stands and make people smile when you hand them one.  Game play is quick, even with new players.  20-30 min.

Although this game is easy to teach to non-gamers, it really lacks a "wow" factor.  Cute but really not that overly interesting.

Excellent and fun!  I love German Ebay!!  Oh and mine came with the CD!  A much better and more attractive game than Medici.  The theme sucks you in and keeps you whether or not you win or lose.  Strategy tip:  be sure to get multiple awards for cranking out some early mid-range hits!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is the Knizia auction game that finally took, I think.  We both have been suspicious of Knizia, and auction games (for two, at least) because of Medici vs. Strozzi, but Hollywood Blockbuster is very highly rated, so when I wound up with a copy through a math trade, we were both ready to give it a chance.  And while not a mind-blow, it is quite good.  We laughed a lot at the stupid movie and studio references, and the components are nice - for such a thin theme, you can get into it to a surprising degree.  And the zero-sum nature of the bidding helps make it work, even with two.  I'd recommend this, but think it might be over-rated, at least based on the BGG ranking.

Yeah, couldn't get it played ever - not a horrible game, but there are much better uses of the time.  Perhaps we just don't like most auction games.  I'm blaming Knizia though.

This one hits just the right spot for me.  The recycling of the bids means that there is an upside to losing auctions, which makes it a lighter game (contrasting with the viciousness of Merchants of Amsterdam for instance).  And the theming is simply excellent - the old movies and stars really make the game and produce many memorable incidents.  Still fresh in the mind is Charlton Heston's appearance as a guest star in Bambi - together with the explanation - which was that he was, of course, the b*** who shot Bambi's mom.  Among the many nice features is Knizia's Hitchcock touch of including himself.  Superb stuff.

12 Jan 05: Just played it for the first time and am enthralled. I prefer this one to Ra, though there is a lot to like about that one as well. For me the less abstract character and fun theme is a big boost. More family-friendly than Ra. Now I just have to procure a copy of my own. I'm kicking myself for not having bought a copy from Woolworth (here in Germany) at the bargain price of 5 Euros!!!

BTW, translating and reprinting this for the US market would be a great move. I like the vintage movie theme, but perhaps one with more recent movies would suck in more non-gamers. But then, it seems German-style games have an uphill struggle in getting shelfspace in US stores anyway.

UPDATE: Keeps getting on to the table. Great immersive stuff.

The closed economy the contract splitting mechanic creates a really unique and dynamic auction system. It's one of my favorite single mechanics in any game, ever.

Hollywood Blockbuster. I don't mind the fake titles and actors. I could have done with a little less cheese, but I think they did a pretty decent job with it.

Probably needs some kind of paste-up though - I would love to make a custom version of this - if only I had a whiff of talent. The closed economy auction is very interesting, and the theme works very nicely with the mechanics. High fun factor.

One of my favorite auction games by far, both thematically great and mechanically simple yet effective. Will be a mainstay of my collection.

RATING: 8
I first encountered this game as Traumfabrik, and being a fan of movies was charmed by it. Despite it being in German, we worked out what most of the classic movies were as we played.

In buying my own copy, I decided to get an English Language version. I avoided Hollywood Blockbuster, as it seemed to "jokey" for me, and bought Dream Factory.

I really should like it, as it is the same mechanics, but it isn't the same, for two reasons. The minor reason is the use of non-real names of actors/directors/films in the more recent versions - made necessary, no doubt, due to lawsuits. The major reason is that this worked far better for me with earlier age films, like Casablanca or Vertigo.

So I have traded my copy. Sometime, I may buy an original Traumfabrik, if I can find one.

RATING: 7
2nd favorite Knizia Auction game.  List goes: Modern Art, T-Fab(HB), Medici, Ra.  I enjoy the closed economy and the theme of the game.  Building movies is just fun.  Don't get caught up making the worst movie, it can be your undoing.

Games don't get much more fun than this.  The zero-sum bidding mechanism is fascinating.  I love the planning made possible by seeing upcoming lots.  The math is subtle and mysterious, and you can't beat the theme.  You really feel like you're competing to attract the best talent in Hollywood.  Oozing with atmosphere, great mechanics, and sheer fun.

(A.k.a. Traumfabrik.)  It's a shame this game is (currently) not readily available in the U.S.!  It's a great auction game, and the use of old movies and stars is pretty classy.  Even though I don't watch movies, I think the theme is the kicker for me; I wouldn't buy this game if it were released with all fake movies, most likely.

Enjoyable lighter feeling bidding game. You bid in four rounds. There are a fixed number of contracts (bidding chips) that are equally split between the losers of each auction. In a round all the stuff you bid on is open so you know what is coming up.

There are quite a few pieces to set up, but the gameplay itself moves along quickly.  We have played with 2 or 3 players, and the game plays nicely either way.  It's fine for 2 even though it's largely an auction game.  There aren't many contracts (money) in play, and whoever wins an auction pays the other player, so you must manage your contracts carefully.  The theme is really fun and adds alot to the game.  The rules are easy to learn and the English translation on bgg is very clearly written.

Fun auction game.  More 'fun' than Ra, but a lesser game.  I wonder if the unused contracts at the end of the game are too valuable.  Knizia's got a gift at making games deeper than they seem. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Knizia does it again, this time with a theme that actually helps enhance the enjoyment of the game.  Simple bid mechanics, well-designed components, and a clever choice of vintage films for highlighting (or spoofing) make this a light but still engaging game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a pretty good Knizia auction game, but it certainly didn't grab me as much as something like Ra or even Modern Art.  There don't seem to be as many subtleties to this one as there are with the other two games.  Of Knizia's auction games, this one is on the weaker end of the scale - certainly Ra is worth playing first.  On the whole, though, it's still a pleasant game.  It may also be more straightforward and accessible than the other two, which might be beneficial in the right circumstances.

I think the closed circut economy is really interesting. I have not seen this mechanic in any other game. The theme is a lot of fun as we really enjoy movies. The presentation is pretty cheesy but the gameplay is solid. I am becoming a big fan of auction games.

RATING: 5
Maybe something is wrong with me, but this and Ra don't grab me.  And I'm a Knizia fan. Perhaps I haven't played it enough times to get to the fun part.  Perhaps I won't ever. I can see what works in the game, but it appears not to be for me.

The auction mechanism of this game is both fun and frustrating.  If one of you is obviously better at auctions, then there is not much you can do to win the game.  Nonetheless, it is a fun play.

The auctions for production chips are fun, especially if you and other players want them badly.  (I'll pay anything for Grace Kelly!)

Actually, it's got to be Traumfabrik for real movie buffs!
Can get a little repetitive towards the end of the game, since the auctions are all of the same type. Still, a great auction/bidding game with a great theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game just clicks for me.  I love the theme. I love the simplicity of the rules. The fact that your bids are redistributed to the other players is a wonderful balancing mechanic.  There are competing tensions to complete movies quickly or take your time for high value (or as low as possible)...so its not obvious who has the edge. 

It plays quickly and smoothly, yet the bidding is exciting and holds suprises. The German components are not a significant issue. I wish the movie titles were all in English, but you can figure out most of them without knowing much German, and it doesn't impact gameplay at all.

I still can't quite decide if the parties work. We've played that the winner of the last auction loses all ties when selecting tiles based on number of red bordered tiles you have. I think I'd read that this was the German rule. But it still feels like the rich get richer if they simply select more red tiles. 

The theme sure makes the game work, however. (This capsule is for "Traumfabrik".)

RATING: 7
Traumfabrik is one of the second tier Knizia auction games, however, given that his first tier has the two games that I think are the best in the genre (Modern Art, Ra) that's not exactly a damning indictment.

In this game, players bid for the right to acquire actors, directors, special effects, &c. to finish the film scripts that they have in front of them. All of those elements are depicted on small tiles and are rated in stars based on their skill/popularity/&c. At the beginning of each round, the board is filled with a random assortment of tiles and then players bid for the right to acquire complete lots. Films that are completed are ranked based on the star rating of the tiles used to complete them, and bonus points are given out for the best films each round and in each genre.

The core gimmick of Traumfabrik is the nature of the bidding currency, contracts. The winner of each auction has to redistribute the amount bid evenly to the other players. This creates a rather interesting element in practice, as players have to be wary of flooding the market at the wrong time, or allowing one person to build up too much of a lead in the bidding currency or they can risk being taken to the woodshed in several consecutive auctions.

Though the game has some limitations which limit its appeal for me (primarily the on-a-rail auction where players have no decisions to make about what goes on the block) it still manages to provide a solid, fun, and interesting experience due to the bidding twist. The only real downside to this is that the original game, themed to the golden age of Hollywood, is now rather difficult to find and the garbage Hollywood Blockbuster remake with the caricature theme is much more common. Though I'm not crazy about the game, I've been tempted to do a retheme on this for years based on my own film interests.

OK, the theme is awesome and there is an at least vauge connection to the actual action and mechanics of the game.  And I'll give it credit for forcing me into bizarre suboptimal plays just so I could team up Hitchcock and Karloff in my own version of Vertigo.  But all that coolness isn't enough to support a dull, routine auction game that wears out its welcome a quarter of the way through.  The decisions are mostly obvious and the mechanics are reductions of things that Knizia used before.  There's really no reason to play this unless you're just in love with the theme.  I was, but it's just so damn dull, dated, and uninteresting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The movie making theme is a big plus for me. Underneath that theme is a very good bidding game. Which also requires proper management of what you end up winning be it actors, directors or other people and equipment necessary to produce the movies you are working on. Like most bidding games with a little experience you can have a very close and balanced game. The mechanic of holding the hollywood parties makes having a stable of stars in your studio critical, perhaps a little too critical but that is my only knock on the game. It still compares well with Ra, Modern Art and Medici.

RATING: 2

The original German version of this game is great and would rate a 10 from me. It is a great auction game with a wonderful theme based on old b&w hollywood movies. The old version was loaded with class with it's actual images of real life actors and directors. Also, the component quality was top notch and came with a nice CD of music from the movies. 

Problems rose with copyright issues, so the game has recently been republished by Uberplay in a new version that uses a weak attempt at satire to avoid any legal problems. Unfortunately, the resulting version is extremely sub par. 

The new version is, but a shadow of it's former self. The graphics are horrible with just a nauseating color scheme. The components are flimsy cardboard garbage from China. Worse of all is the pathetic use of, so called satirical names for the actors and directors. Demi Less? Jeeze, talk about ridiculous. Better to come up with completely fictional names.

Shame on Uberplay for publishing this trash. Do yourselves a favor and fire the graphic designer and artist. And shame on you Herr Knizia for allowing your excellent game to be demeaned in such a fashion. It would have been better to let it stay out of print and die a peaceful death.

Do yourself a big favor and fork out the bucks and get yourself a German copy and use paste ups if you don't speak German. You will be glad you did!

[updated 9/19/2010]

Since Uberplay is dead (one could surmise from putting out pieces of shit like Hollywood Blockbuster) I am raising my rating to 2 in celebration! Yes, they have been 6' feet under since '08, but I am a lazy bastard. 

One can hope that Filosofia's edition of the game, Dream Factory will be worthy and I can move the ratings up another notch. I don't hold out much hope based on the images I have seen showing a similarly tepid sense of humor, but I will wait and see.

I like auctions. I also like the zero-sum money. Very few games do the "I need to save my money now, for something I know I'll need later" thing as well as this. Gret balance between the known (normal spaces for the quarter, and other players movies) and unknown (party spaces, future quarters, and future scripts). Some games get boring once I feel like I figured them out a bit (which is not to mastery--I don't play any game that much), but I still enjoy this, even though you can exactly compute how much certain tiles are worth to you (and others).

Outstanding auction game with a great theme.  Like so many of Knizia's games, it really shines after multiple plays, especially if all the players have some experience with this game.  If you can, track down the original edition of Traumfabrik. It is vastly superior to the ridiculous cartoon version that is Hollywood Blockbuster which set a new low for standards on reprints.  Dream Factory is a better attempt, but still falls woefully short of the charm of the original.

This game is not at all what I thought it would be, but was definitely a good time. It's a nice choice if you like auction-style games.

Players bid "contracts" in order to obtain various required resources to complete film scripts - directors, actors, sound, special effects, cinematography, and maybe a guest star.  The first and best films of each type get special awards, so you aim to get the highest quality of films as you can.  But be careful - only COMPLETE films count at the end.

The silly names for actors and scripts are a lot of the fun here. The novelty may wear off after awhile, but for a once-in-awhile pure auction game, this is good, clean fun.

Components: Traumfabrik edition: Great tiles, great artwork. The theme is well-realized and greatly enhances my enjoyment of the game.
Uberplay edition: Artwork is a bit blah. There should be some iconography to distinguish the different placement rules, and to know which stars are actors vs. guest stars (the guest star rules is quite strange).

Experience: An immediate hit with me. The auction is typical, but it is fun to recruit different crew members to fill out my movies, and the variety of tiles and movie requirements ensures that each auction group will have unique values for each player.

Not as much fun playing the Uberplay edition with the fake names.

I like the circulating money, and how bidding someone up benefits me. It can be really tough to complete some pictures.

Very excellent game that is easy to learn and play but offers a nice depth of strategy and interplay.  Played this game with 4 and we didn't have to look at the rules after the first quarter (there are 4 quarters).

I would give this a higher rating if they kept the art style of the original german version, the pastel colors are kind of sickly, but still do the job, and the names of the actors are just silly and not very funny at all.  

I see now they changed the name of this game. The version I have is Hollywood Blockbusters

Don't wait too long, though, other than maybe for that utter piece of crap with Reiner as the guest star!

Fun theme and good gateway game as people can easily relate to it.  Unfortunately I don't like how the total currency (contracts) is fixed and just redistributed throughout the course of the game.  For some reason it really takes away a lot of strategy.  If people bid high, everyone starts bidding high and vice versa.  Given the choice I'd pick Ra over this every time.  For new gamers it'd be a good lead-up to Ra, though.

What is it with Knizia and auction games? He has a knack for making them each different enough, yet all fun. This one has players bidding on tiles to complete a movie in order to collect VPs. Fairly easy and quick to play.

I really enjoy the theme for this game and feel it's a game that works well for family and first-time gamers. The two-player game is not as advanced, but once you get five players vying for the movie chips, it gets very exciting. A light to medium game that just makes me smile when played. I suspect this one will hit the table more often than a lot of other games I own.

It's Dr Reiner Knizia's most thematic game. It is super fun and would get a way bigger scre from me if it had modern day movies and actors. I know there are pastes online, but I hate having to make the job I'd like the company to have done for me.

Date approximative du texte: 2001

Vous incarnez un producteur hollywoodien en quête de gloire qui va tenter de produire les meilleurs films et de rafler le maximum de récompenses.

Préparation
Sur le plateau placez les 4 tuiles grands réalisateurs (dos clair) faces visibles.
A coté du plateau alignez les pions de valeur croissante de 0 à 22 avec les valeur doublées de 8 à 14.
Chaque joueur reçoit 12 contrats vertrag (10 à 5 joueurs, les contrats restants sont retirés du jeu, et un paravent pour les cacher. En fonction du numéro de studio qui figure sur le paravent, le joueur reçoit 3 scénarii. Si il y a moins de 5 joueurs les scénarii qui aurait dût être distribués à ce moment sont retirés définitivement. Les 7 scenarii sans numéro de studio sont posés prés du plateau en une pile face visible.
Placez un des 4 grands réalisateur face visible sur la première case (Hollywood). Piochez et placez des tuiles de production faces visibles sur les autres cases, le nombre de tuile à placer est indiqué. Sur les cases Party, placez faces cachées autant de tuiles qu’il y a de joueurs.

But du jeu : marquer le maximum de points en produisant des films de forte valeur et en récoltant des Oscars. Pour cela il faut compléter par des tuiles de production adéquates les scenarii.

Le jeu
Il se déroule sur quatre manches. A chaque manche les joueurs visitent les uns après les autres différents lieux du plateau où des tuiles de production sont mises aux enchères. A la fin des manches des récompenses sont attribuées.

Les enchères
Elles se font à l’aide des tuiles contrat, le premier joueur annonce sa mise, puis les autres doivent surenchérir ou passer définitivement. Il est interdit de s’endetter et l’enchère se poursuit tant qu’il y a au moins deux enchérisseurs. Le gagnant de l’enchère remporte l’ensemble des tuiles de production du lieu et dépose sa mise au centre du plateau. Le premier joueur prend alors l’ensemble des contrats au centre du plateau et les distribue un par un à tous les joueurs sauf au gagnant de l’enchère. Tout le monde reçoit le même nombre de contrat s’il y a un reliquat il retourne au centre du plateau.
Le gagnant de l’enchère devient le premier joueur pour l’enchère suivante. Il pose alors ses tuiles sur les emplacements de ses scenarii, si une tuile ne l’intéresse pas il la défausse définitivement.

Règles de pose des tuiles de production sur les scénarii
Il faut respecter le type de tuile exigé.
Les tuiles agence agentur peuvent être placées n’importe où sauf sur les emplacements guest star (étoile).
Il est possible de superposer des tuiles tant que le film est inachevé. Sur une tuile agentur il est interdit de superposer autre chose qu’une tuile agentur.
Les emplacement blancs peuvent recevoir tout type de tuile de production. En cas de superposition de tuile sur un emplacement blanc il faut le même type de tuile.
Les tuiles guest stars (acteur dans une étoile) ne sont pas indispensables pour achever un film. Si il ne manque que la guest star, le film est considéré comme terminé.

Les lieux Party
Lorsque les joueurs arrivent sur un lieu party, les tuiles sont retournées faces visibles. Les joueurs choisissent une tuile. Les premiers à choisir sont ceux qui ont le plus d’acteurs (tuiles acteur + guest stars) sur les films achevés ou non. En cas d’égalité c’est la position dans l’ordre du tour qui les départage.
Il n’y a pas d’enchère sur un lieu party et le premier joueur reste le même pour le lieu suivant.

Finir un film
Dés qu’un joueur termine un film il additionne les étoiles sur les tuiles visibles, les étoiles en haut du scénario. Attention il y a un très mauvais acteur ( R. Knizia) en guest star avec une étoile noire qui retire une étoile à la valeur du film.
Il prend alors le jeton valeur qui correspond et s’il est indisponible il prend celui immédiatement disponible de valeur inférieure. S’il y deux jetons de même valeur il prend en priorité le jeton avec un +. Le jeton est posé sur le scénario.
Il tire ensuite le scénario supérieur de la pile tant qu’il y en a.
Un film achevé ne peut plus être modifié.
Il y a trois grandes catégories de film: dramatique, aventure et divertissement repérable au code couleur sur le scénario. Le premier joueur à avoir achevé un film dans une de ces catégorie remporte la récompense de 5 points dans sa catégorie.

Fin de la manche
Quand tous les lieux ont été visités c’est la fin de la manche. A la fin des trois premières manches la récompense du meilleur film est attribué (statuette grise de 5 point) au film de plus forte valeur en cas d’égalité de valeur c’est le film qui à été terminé avant qui l’emporte, c’est à dire celui avec le jeton +. Un même film peut recevoir plusieurs fois cette récompense tant qu’il reste le meilleur.

Fin de la partie
A la fin de la quatrième manche, une récompense de 10 points est attribuée pour le film de plus forte valeur dans chacune des trois catégories. Une récompense de 10 points est attribuée pour le meilleur producteur c’est à dire le joueur qui cumule le plus d’étoiles sur ses tuiles réalisateur pour l’ensemble de ses films. Les tuiles agence ne sont pas comptabilisées, et en cas d’égalité la récompense n’est pas attribuée. Enfin une récompense de 10 points du meilleur nanar va au film de plus faible valeur.
Score final : il faut additionner la valeur des films terminés, les récompenses et les contrats qui restent en main.

Mon opinion
Quelle belle boite de jeu! L’éditeur Hasbro déjà abonné aux succès commerciaux (cluedo, master mind, risk..) ne s’est pas trompé en éditant le jeu de Reiner Knizia. Rien de ce que l’on peut reprocher aux jeux de société allemands n’affecte Traumfabrik ; le thème est original et super bien exploité et il y a une bonne ambiance autour de la table. Le matériel est beau et dans mon édition il y a même un CD des grands standards de musique de film pour parfaire la soirée. On s’y croit!
Il y a peu d’allemand dans les éléments de jeu à part les titres des films qui ont été traduits et c’est un peu dommage car en allemand ils sont moins parlants.
Tout le monde s’amuse et rigole des associations qu’ils font: tiens Marilyn Monroe dans King Kong!
L’ensemble des possibilités est un peu difficile à appréhender, mais il y a pleins de tactiques: faire peu de films mais excellents (stratégie Kubrick) plein de films médiocres (stratégie Bollywood), faire un film nul pour récolter la récompense du nanar (c’est pas si facile et ça c’est la stratégie Max Pecas) faire une course de vitesse au premier tour pour rafler la récompense du premier film dans sa catégorie et du meilleur film pour le tour… Et je ne parle pas des fameux jetons de valeurs de film qui peuvent réservés des surprises: Si mon film vaut 12 et qu’il n’y plus de jeton de 6 à 12 et bien sa valeur est… 5.
Knizia est un auteur talentueux qui décline avec talent le principe des enchères. Avec à son actif des jeux adulés comme Moderne Art, Ra et Medici il est difficile de dire quel est le meilleur. Traumfabrik a pour lui un vrai thème et ne s’adresse pas à un public de spécialistes mais il pêche un peu au niveau du contrôle du jeu surtout à 5 joueurs. En tout cas, il fait partie de ces jeux que je conseille sans restriction car je sais qu’il ne vieillira pas et qu’il peut être joué avec le plus grand nombre.

Still one of my favorite movie-themed games, even if the theme seems to be slapped on a generic auction mechanic at first, but it plays very fluidly and the race to create the best (or worst) picture really means there are hard decisions to make...

This is a great game of bid and bluster, with a fabulous theme and a tight, zero-sum auction.  The Hollywood studio system theme meshes well with the innovative mechanisms, creating an immersive experience seldom seen in Knizia's games.

(Original Traumfabrik edition) One of the best pure set-collecting auction games (and I'm not a big fan of auction games in general), where you collect various elements to produce films that score points.  It uses a cool zero-sum monetary system that lets you win either by putting together a lot of modest films or a small number of high-scoring films (I've even seen it won by a person who completed only one film).  Fantastic theme of Hollywood's Golden Age, with real stars and directors featured on the counters.

A Knizia auction game; lighter than Ra or Modern Art, but perhaps with a broader appeal. Fun, but not very deep, and pretty luck dependent. There is tension and suspense however, so the game is never boring. I love the theme here, which is perhaps unusual for a Knizia game.

RATING: 9
Easy to learn, easy to play. The &#039;money&#039; redistribution mechanism works very well to keep the game balanced. When combined with the fact that the resources up for auction are mostly open this adds a timing element to planning that is quite subtle. Decisions are not usually terribly difficult, which could be seen as a criticism, but this ensures that the game moves along at a good pace and usually plays in under an hour.

My favorite Knizia auction game. This one is great!  Good theme, mechanics.  A must buy for those who like auctions.  Needs a reprint badly.  Finally got the reprint!  Can't wait to play it.

The Uberplay reprint (Hollywood Blockbuster) is a little cheesy in that the 4 star directors and actors have pun names.  But the game is the same and just as fun.  Component quality is excellent.

RATING: 8
Great auction game by Reiner Knizia, themed on Hollywood. Players are studio moguls, trying to hire the best actors, directors, camera men, and so on to complete their movies. Terrific theme featuring real movies, actors and directors - a real who's who of Hollywood. Behind all this there is a terrific game that is quite subtle. One of the best games released in 2000.

The great auction game for beginners... and it is a great way to get people over the fact that many of the great games are only available in German! This is a great, fast-playing little auction game. A little bit of bluff while trying to up the other players' bids, a litle bit of 'what is it worth to me?' factor as each player may need certian tiles over others, and a little bit of min-maxing your own movies. Our preferred auction game with new players. Awesome for getting people into the hobby.

RATING: 9
Hollywood Blockbuster Uberplay edition: When I took out the counter sheets, I was surprised at how thin they were.  They would be fine for a $20 small box game, but this is a $40 big box edition.  Boo to Uberplay for cheaping out on the counters!  

As for the gameplay, this game may replace Medici as my #2 auction game (with #1 being Ra).  I love the dynamics of the economy - there seems to be just the right amount of money in the game.  In this game, it is somewhat easier to evaluate the value of lots than is typical in Knizia auction games, and I enjoy that as a change of pace.  I also like that you can look ahead to some degree.

UPDATE: OK, all that stuff about Hollywood Blockbuster being better than Medici was crazy talk, but HB is still very very good and much better themed.

This is the third of Reiner Knizia's auction games I've played, and enjoyed it quite a lot.  Enjoyed it as much if not a little more than [thing=118][/thing].  I played the Überplay edition, and I found the movie & actor parodies of known actors & titles kept the mood of gameplay light & jovial.  I suspect if I were to play the original "Traumfabrik", the classic films and lack of parody would lower my rank.

Rating is for the "Hollywood Blockbuster" version, not the original Tra-...Tram-...Trafu-...German version. 

I really do not enjoy this game. Do I get the feeling that I'm making a movie? No. I'm filling spots on a piece of cardboard with other pieces of cardboard. I don't necessarily need heavy theme for a game to be enjoyable (see my rating for Tigris and Euphrates), but this one is not complex or deep enough for the pasted on theme to make it a game I want to play.

UPDATE: Played again a decade later with the family. It's not as bad as my prior review would suggest. Decent auction mechanism - I like that "money" gets recycled to those who lost the auction. Upgrade.

I played this game for the first time on July 1st 2005 at a huge gamer meeting at a local school.  Traumfabrik is very enjoyable game. Another good auction/bidding game from Reiner Knizia. Too bad is available only in German and is OOP.

I purchased the reprint. Traumfabrik is something to have for any auction/bidding gamer.

Game isn't too long. It can be played fast and can do as a filler. Played both the German and 
English edition. I prefer the German due to the fact it has the real names, but the game is basically the same.

I simply enjoy the theme of this game. It's quite unique in its genre. Not a lot of games like this. Very original.

Own Hollywood Blockbuster.

Solid auction game that requires you to closely track what players are collecting since many of the bonuses are based on achieving goals before others do.  Timing is critical since scoring tokens run out forcing you to take a lower amount than you planned for.  Update- played Hollywood Blockbuster and thought the names of the actors, directors, and movies were quite funny.  IMO, the new version is not inferior to Traumfabrik.

I was very pleased with how smoothly this game played. It's a fast game for how many auctions occur, and there are some good decisions to be had. Don't take your eyes off the prizes at the end, they help. Hoarding contracts can also pay off too. 

Oh, I don't care for classic films, but I can see how Traumfabrik would have made a better theme.

RATING: 8
A straightforward auction game from Knizia but nothing that blows you away like Ra or Amun-Re. Sadly for the Hollywood Blockbuster version, whatever the appeal the theme would have had has been emasculated by the lame spoof names and artwork. Some of the spoof names are really lame. Raiders of the Lost Biblical Receptacle? How uncreative is that?! My recommendation: stick with Traumfabrik.

[1 play] I played the Traumfabrik version--which seems infinitely preferable, but on the other hand, it's hard to resist the urge to cast films correctly or hire one's favorite actors.

Pretty enjoyable, and no doubt successful as an intro bidding game because of the ease of determining the relative value of the 'goods'.  As such, it feels just the right length - perhaps a bit light for extended repeat play, but some decent interaction may mitigate that.

Good game, seems like an old overlooked classic gem, played this first this year. But you have to know the mechanic and what is important to "win" or at least to be competitive till the end. Experienced players will allways win if they do not support decisions by first/or less experienced players. (Hint: It's important to have "Stars", tiles with red rendering, that you stay competitive in the bidding and ranking of choosing tiles!)

It seems on of the "older" Knizia's which are not well balanced till the deep end, but it's still fun to play and the theme is really good and not often used.
I would recommend a "try" by yourself, its a really nice game, for families with an fresh and unconsumed theme.

I think the inflated ratings on BGG are pretty stale and reflect what people thought when it first came out. It's a fine super-filler but in light of games that have come  since it's just so-so IMO.

A light auction game that casual gamers could grasp. It can be tough to get a handle on auction valuations when playing it cold (since it's tough to tell how much time you have and exactly how the money flows), but if everyone is in the same boat the game can still be fairly balanced.

At this point (2016) I'm not sure when I would ever request this game but I could be convinced to play from time to time.

I enjoy the currency recycling.  A fun bidding game.   Movie titles are groanworthy in an entertaining way.

RATING: 5
The game has an interesting money mechanism that I'd like to figure out the dynamics of. The amount of money in the game is fixed at the start. As you spend money on your films, your opponents get richer, and then you have to wait for them to spend so that you can have money to spend again. It's a matter of looking ahead and deciding when you want your spending cycle peaks to occur. Feels like Ra where you're giving your high bidding token to the winner of the next auction.

RATING: 5
Another Knizia auction game, and despite the nice theme, it's the dullest of the lot. Closed economy, rising bids, passing, winning bid divied up. You bid on chipc for directors, stars, camera etc to complete various films, scoring points for their cumulative value. But the chips come up randomly, so although you can see what's on offer, it's largely luck that you have the money to get the ones you want. A few tweaks but really there is nothing going on here. Nice production, big star names, but no surprise this was picked by Hasbro. My edition Traumfabrik came WITH the CD. woot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Let's see... if you're a fan of movies & Knizia games, is this title worth having?  You BETCHA!  A great combination of the two with a closed income/bidding system.  I don't think the actor tiles are that imbalanced since their true value is normally understood (with experienced players).  Getting a good deal and completing your movie projects timely will also help you along.  Grade: B+

This is a very cool game, I love it.  One of my favorite gateway games - but oh so much more.  Much different than Modern art, although an auction game, this isn't as pure - but the added complexity is so fine.  I like the way currency circulates, when you win a bid, your contracts are divided among the other players, with leftovers staying in the pot.  And the definete amount of production tokens - no doubles.  In fact all of the components have limitations, such as the screenplays.  You have to weigh and balance many things in your strategy.  Very, very interesting & plays fast as well.  The theme definetely integrates beautifully with this game.  I'm glad I got the original, because the new one doesn't sound like it will be as fun with fictional names.  I would recommend this as an early purchase in your collection - seek out the old one on ebay.de.

RATING: 10
The Traumfabrik version is a much better version than the Americanized Hollywood Blockbuster.  The black and white tiles and board invoke the early era of American movies and the board is just the right size for the game.  The play of Hollywood blockbuster is the same, however the board has grown into an unnecessary monstrosity of obnoxiously bright colors.  The tiles follow suit and are much harder to distinguish than the black and white.  Also, while humorous, the fake names take away from the realness of the theme and make it seem more hokey.  And alas, no Reiner.
This game does not require reading, so may be taught to more advanced children.

RATING: 7
Knizia cannot go wrong with auction games.  We find the familiar feeling of needing so many things at the same time as the other players.  The scarcity causes a temporary inflation on the exact things you're looking for.  Decide early if you're trying for one big movie or several smaller ones as either avenues seem to offer a running chance to victory.  Moves along well and is distinct enough from Ra and Modern Art to interest players of the other Knizia classics.

Traumfabrik - This is a very fun game that I don't think is quite a top-tier Knizia. Most similar to RA, but not quite at the same level. It is a little more accessible though, so it's great for new gamers. The theme helps too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
[Auctions, Set Collection, Film, Hollywood] {4P:9, 5P:9} I'm sorry, but the rating for this game is heavily driven by the theme and its marriage to the mechanisms. As a film geek and movie fan, this is home-made heaven. You can make all sorts of sets using the entire history of films, and it will never, ever grow old. I've resisted rating the game because it's heavily theme-driven (the auctions are simple compared to, say, Modern Art), but the entertainment value is quite simply off the charts for me. Give it a year, this might be a 10 - a theme-driven 10, but still. Excuse me, Mister Spielberg is on line two, demanding to know why I cast Jim Carrey to play opposite Monica Bellucci in his remake of Dead Again... :D ***UPDATE: T-Fab is getting regular play at our table, and repeated play is showing that this is far from the simple "auction game on rails" that some make it out to be. There's an interaction going on between The number of tiles in each lot, how many stars those tiles have (and in what mix), the types of tiles, the film projects people have and HOW they're trying to complete them (fast, star power, really bad, just enough to be best in class, best directors). Then there's the timing, which to me is the hallmark of a good Reiner game. There's all kinds of things happening in people's evaluations of where they're going to bid, how much they're going to bid, and where they're going to "rest". The closed economy creates an ebb and flow of financial might between the film companies, so much so that you need to time things right if you want to win more than one lot in a sweeps. It's imperative that you have a ceiling, and a backup plan. I think I know why Reiner put this game "on rails" - if players could identify which lot to put up for auction next, the game would become a little more complex, and a little slower. He went for the faster option since T-Fab's supposed to be a Hasbro mass market game. Anyway, I'm considering this the best $70 I've ever spent, next to the Ravensburger Torres. The theme boosts T-Fab over RA and Modern Art in my book. Its mechanisms are not substantially inferior to the two more well-known games. If this was ever released in a North American English edition, it might well be Reiner's best-regarded auction effort. Outstanding game.

Auction!  Auction!  ANOTHER auction!  If you don't like auction games, steer clear.  I DO like them, and I really enjoy this one.  The bits are beautifully produced, but find a REALLY BIG table to play on.  Actually just play on the floor (if you don't have pets).  It's a funny, clever auction-fest.  It's fun to watch the race for the Worst Movie Award (which can be a SURPRISINGLY helpful 10 points).  I like how the winning bid gets distributed among the losers... nifty mechanic there.

Great auction game with very simple rules and a closed economy. Hire the most talented directors, actors, musicians, etc. for your movies and triumph at the Oscar ceremonies.

Everything you need for producing a movie is auctioned off in various auction rounds. The amount paid by the winner of each round is immediately distributed to all the other players. Each completed movie scores at once, there is a bonus for getting things done fast, and there are of course the Oscars for the best movies in various categories. Will you go cheap and quick, or monumental and slow? And sometimes, it all comes down to who managed to score the worst movie of the game and win the anti-Oscar...

PRO - Good theme.  I think the Uberplay edition has nice components.  Was accessible for family.  

CON - Weird scoring using the film tokens.  The first picture worth 19 points is worth 19 points but the second picture worth 19 points is only worth 17 points?!?  I know it's supposed to add urgency to completing your films before someone else scores the same amount, but no one is tracking anybody's films closely enough to determine that they'd better step up their efforts.  All you know is you're happily adding up your blockbuster picture only to find out you get shortchanged on its worth.

This is the first auction game I have played. As the rules were in German it took a little while to pick up on strategy. I think the most fun was looking at the movies at the end of the game with unlikely actors/directors. I don't know how this game would go on long term replay value. The game itself seemed to have low player interaction. So my rating can only be taken as a preliminary one.

To add my reaction - &quot;we played the wrong game.&quot; We chose between Settlers, Fist of Dragonstones, or Fabrik. Either of the other two would have been more enjoyable. This game could have been developed by any American company (Parker Brothers, Milton Bradley) 30 years ago. Not that different from Masterpiece, etc.

Dream Factory doesn't feel much more than your standard auction game for bits that are worth points. However, it's brilliant mechanic of splitting the bid money (contracts) equally to the non-winning players is so smart and totally makes that game. Otherwise, the rest of it works and doesn't feel tacked on- which makes Dream Factory quite a good auction game. Different film objectives gives players options on where they place their won tokens, so there's a nice sense of control in the game. Anyway- nothing mind blowing but the auction mechanic is unique and makes the game totally worth playing if just for that.

I prefer Ra as an over all auction game, but the theme in Traumfabrik sells the game for me.  I am a fan of old films especially those with Cary Grant.  So when the opportunity arises to remake some classics starring the Welsh actor I can't turn it down. (I can't believe he's only a two star actor - the games single biggest flaw)

UPDATE: I hate that this game is now known as Hollywood Blockbuster.  It sounds as if it is some DVD game slapped with the franchise tag of everyone's favorite video store.  Bring back Traumfabrik, or at least call it dream theatre.

UPDATE: After a couple more plays this game rises for me and really begins to shine on it's own merits. I am now sort of torn between which of Knizia's auction games I prefer.  For now, Ra still gets the nod as it has been the most played, but Traumfabrik is catching up.  

UPDATE:  I still think Traumfabrik is a great title, but I find the five player game a little too chaotic.  I feel this game is best served with three or four.

When I heard about this game I didn't think I would like the theme , and then I noticed it was a Knizia game, tried it, and became instantly fond of the it.  Every game has been a blast; the theme fits purposefully and the faux mocking of hollywood is something I totally dig.  One of my favorites.

Edit - bumped it down a tad since I've never been able to win it...the luck factor in this one is insidious, but still awesome.

Not a very deep game, but fun to make movies with crazy casts.  More strategy to the auction gameplay than first meets the eye.  Much like Ra in its mechanics.  With 5 players, it becomes very difficult to complete a movie, and it's a race to just finish a film rather than a race to complete the best films.

I'm happy I own the German version with names of real actors.

HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER/DREAM FACTORYFrom Tanga on 7-2-07. First game played 9-22-07. I will reserve final judgement for a bit. We had a good time but I think that playing the game while reading the rules and trying to get everyone aware was a little much. We will try again in a couple of weeks and I'm sure rating will change. So for now lets say a 6.5 with the great potential of the rating climbing in the future. Another play with 4 players. Much better understanding of subtleties of game. Increased to 7.5 with further increase possible. Two further plays raises this to 8.0

Made a very fine Disney version, as seen in the Files section. Took it to L.A. in the hopes I could get to play it with my girlfriend's friends we were staying with. Come game night, they opted instead for Apples to Apples. Because of this letdown, I now refuse to ever play Apples to Apples again. 

My rating is based on the 2-player game, which works exceedingly well. But then again, I'm a sucker for closed economy auction games.

Having now played this 3- and 4-player, I put this amongst my favorite auction games. Prefer it at lower player counts.

From a design standpoint, it's not quite as elegant as other Knizia auction games such as Modern Art, Ra, and Medici.

A darn good game, although not quite a "classic" IMO.

Funny auction game on a cinema theme.  Rating not so high becauce a few auction are annoying since only one player needs what's for auction.  It can be frustrating to not have a single actor (or contract) on auction for a whole year (especially the last) when you need one to complete a movie.

RATING: 3
Another auction game.  I've never liked games where auctions are the sole mechanic, however.  Played the german version, where REAL movies and stars from the golden age are used.  This ups the appeal immensely compared to the parody figures used in other editions.  Still as only a bidding game I don't care to play again.  Would probably be a great choice for a family game and especially for film buffs.  

I noted a funny easter egg, where the author included himself as a costar who is worth negative points.  Very funny stuff.

RATING: 7
Great theme; has a lot of potential for humorous situations (casting Marilyn Monroe in Ben-Hur).  The game itself is TOTALLY auction-based, so be warned if that's not your thing.  It's well-balanced and has almost no downtime.  It might lose a lot of its magic on subsequent playings, though.

Another great Knizia game. The closed money bidding system is really interesting, and the theme entices non-gamers to play. Several paths to winning, and the random tile draw makes it different every time. Plus it's just fun to put Yul Brynner in Gone with the Wind.

Enjoyed my first game of this and looking forward to playing again. I like the scoring of the films, similar to Aqua Romana.

Edit: Realised we played slightly wrong the first two games by not adding the stars on the actual screenplays themselves to the total. Not a huge mistake but enough to have possibly changed some decisions and possibly the outcome.

A solid auction game with a good theme (for a Knizia.)  Scoring is simple and fun and the game is very well balanced.  Sometimes feel that your strategy is driven by what movies you have and when your movies come up.  We played with 5, but I think it would work better with less.  Its not a fantastic game, but the theme is unique, the auctions are fun, and its available super cheap thanks to tanga saturation.  This is one game I would love to see hasbro pick up with all of their licenses.

UPDATE---  I have soured on this after playing several other better auction games. It is still a good game but will never compete with games like Ra
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun auction game that seems pretty light-hearted. Some very poorly written rules, but simple enough once you figure it out. Compared to Ra or other such games, chance seems to be a bigger factor. It's fun, but for the amount of stuff to think about, it should be a bit more strategic. Still, a very passable auction game, and a theme that is both unique and fun.

RATING: 6
(UberPlay edition) This is a pretty fun quick game.  I've only played it twice (back-to-back) and with five players, so perhaps my rating would go up once I see how it plays with fewer.  Five seemed to stretch the game to its limit. The parody names are horrible and detract from some of the enjoyment; the star-ratings that were given to the actors and directors have very little correlation to reality (Sean Penn a 1-star actor? Spike Lee a 4-star director?  What universe is this?).  Those two factors make me wish they had just gone with completely made up names instead of the shoddy parodies.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A Reiner Knizia game that I haven't played before!  I think that the theme isn't as pasted-on as most others... this is actually about making movies!  But it's an interesting bidding game, where the total amount of money in the game is fixed.  Technically, the amount of money is countable, but we play with it behind screens like in Modern Art, to avoid over-analysis.

I like this game, and think it could play well and be fun especially for newbies to gaming, since it's simpler than Modern Art, but I don't know if it has the same strategic depths.


Note: The "Hollywood Blockbuster" version isn't as fun as the original "Traumfabrik", because all the names of movies and stars are contorted parodies.  I think it would be more fun to make crazy movies with the real names, like "Casablanca", starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Meg Ryan!

RATING: 7
I'd call it a second-tier Knizia auction game. It certainly has some cool wrinkles- The closed economy with money sort of washing back and forth between players makes for a nice ebb and flow to the game, but timing it so you have the money you need when the lot you want appears is tricky. The various awards to shoot for add to the game, as well as the score chips which bump down the value of your film if they are already taken. I definitely like it, but I don't see it overthrowing Ra or Modern Art any time soon.

A fun and highly thematic auction game.  The auction has an interesting wealth-redistribution mechanism, in that the winning bid is parceled out among the other players.  A bit like Ra in that each lot will have a variable worth to each player, depending upon what they've acquired over the course of the game.

2 - 5 players (best with 4 - 5 players)

Aka Traumfabrik.  I own the Hollywood Blockbuster version which uses spoofy-names of movies and actors.  This is another great Knizia auction game where you are trying to create good movies by winning the necessary pieces (directors, actors, special effects, etc.) through auctions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Dream Factory is one of the best of the various games where players are Producers filling the roles in movies/shoes/operas. 

It's fairly light in tone, but offers some interesting auction angles, because money spent by one player to win a star Director will fill the pockets of those who didn't.

The Knizia auction machine is well oiled here, but this actually has some fun theme, and it's great to also create the next Plan 9 from Outer Space as well as Gone With the Wind.

This edition features real Hollywood actors and actresses as opposed to caricatures of them- this was important to me to support the theme of the whole proceeding; while it may not be as truly money extravagant, or budget pinching as real life, the familiar faces help to make this one more real than say, Modern Art.

Neat auction game of movie making. Not a big auction game fan past Ra, but this was a pretty pleasant surprise. Can play with kids or adults, and can be campy fun with differing strategies to win. Only weakness is the fake star names instead of real names. There would also seem to be enough famous composers to have their names on the sound tiles. Yes, I know they are relatively easy to create yourself, but not having to make any would be nice. Still, great lighter game and some campy fun.

Many of the mechanics are worthy of a 7.5 but in terms of gameplay this does nothing new and in terms of theme it does little to excite.

Very simple mechanics, yet very profound, with a theme that actually works. I really feel like I'm in competition with other players, or "studios", trying to put together my greatest body of film work (or my worst). A wonderful bidding game, similar to Ra and Modern Art, where you can go all out and get something you really want, and have nothing left for subsequent turns, or where you can be very prudent and pick your battles. Aggression is rewarded, but only if the tiles come out right. A nice blend of luck and skill.

This game is pretty awesome.  If you like movies and auction games by knizia, you can't go wrong.  But for some meatier auctioning, go with Ra, Evo or Vegas Showdown.  It is samey after many plays so don't over do it or you'll burn out on it.

So very Knizia-esque, so many ways to score. Players bid on (possibly different) things they need to complete a movie, with the closed economy meaning that you can't possibly win everything, so the only real decision is how to time being rich enough to get what you really need. Lighter than most Knizias, fun even.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Including this in the auction "trilogy" makes a great deal of sense--like Ra and Modern Art, there is an interesting twist on what happens to the money bid (in this case, it is distributed among all the losers), and like those two and Medici, you bid for lots which make the tiles in them better or worse.  It also has a feature I very much like in an auction game--the value of a lot is different for different players, so it is much harder to pin down the exact "correct" bid for something.  Add in an extremely accessible and amusing theme, and this game has a lot going for it, though it is perhaps the lightest of the four.  It's just a lot of fun. (2 plays)

A simple auction system is combined with Movie industry themes. The movie theme is mainly focused on the eary ages of cinema and classic movies. The game mechanism is quite simple.

Don't forget to play the nostalgic movie original sound tracks while you are playing the game.

Whilst i liked the core mechanic of the game, i can't stand the half baked satirical humour of the theme - mocking different celebrity names. Not funny, and just stupid. I would have preferred fake films and actors, then you could have at least added a little flavour in by making up what your film was about. If this game gets reskinned (played the most recent print - the US edition starring Pete Smackson and other thinly veiled celebrities) i'd give it another go, but until then, the crappy humour is enough to turn me off what was an otherwise interesting game.

This is an excellent game with a great theme. My favorite auction game just ahead of Medici. I find it shocking that Hasbro has never printed this game here in the states. As with most auction games, it takes a few turns to determine what people will bid, especially with new players. Some luck with the tile draws and when/where they show up but it's balanced nicely. ADVICE: go for the awards.  I was looking forward to the new edition until I found out they will only be caricatures of recent celebrities. It's a real shame that they couldn't pull the licenses together to do a real updated version and get this game into TRU and Walmarts. It couldn't help but sell well!  Having now seen the new version, I'm even more satisfied with the original.  I just care for the bright colors, fake names, and drawings.

Very nice bits, the movie star pics and board lend a lot to it.  Make sure you paste on English movie translations and studio graphics (posted here)--people like to know what movies they're making, and it's cool to see the MGM lion or Fox icon on your little board!  Good basic auction game, could be strategically deeper (e.g. stars/directors shouldn't count the same no matter what kind of movie they're in).  Not too complex, and very playable.  Pretty bits, and a LOT of THEME FEEL for a Knizia game (his stuff is usually soooo dry it hurts).

All good, light fun, and the CD adds a lot to the mood too. Two plays on the trot is one too many though - this is a game that seems to work best as a quick hit and then move on to something else.

A good game. A nice theme and fun to play. It's great fun to try and create both great pictures and a true dog of a show. I played this at Atlanta Fest with a set that had been re-themed to game design. A great idea which made it very fun.

When the "Personal Recommendations" feature of BGG was first introduced, I ran it and this game came up first (i.e. Hollywood Blockbuster).  It happened to be on sale on Tanga at that very moment, and I had a coupon from the old level system, so I bought it.  When I got it to the table, it turned out to be a decent auction game.

I like the bidding mechanic in this game where once you win a bid, you must split what you bid amongst the players you were bidding against. It's also fun to see what movies come out and what actors/directors you attach to them. I prefer TFab although the spoof names in Hollywood Blockbuster can be funny. A good game to introduce to nongamers.

A fun and accessible auction game for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Like any auction game, you need to play a few times to really appreciate the value of any specific piece and non-gamers will likely not grasp it - hence, it can be "unfair".

I own, and strongly prefer, the Traumbfabrik edition (with CD); despite this, I'm thrilled this new edition has been released. 

The theme is right up my alley from my Independent film/TV production days. I absolutely love it. I do wish it was in English, but the paste ups here on the 'Geek are very nice. 

I like the old films best myself as it seems to have more flavor to me compared to generic/made up names. 

For me, the theme alone carries this one far.

RATING: 7
Yes this game is oozing theme and it is a nice auction game. What I don't like about it is the way the parties work (the player with the most actors has first choice of tiles at the parties). It seems that taking the most actors away from a player is difficult. And with there being 8 parties in the game I find that advantage too great. I'm willing to play the game but there are other auction games I enjoy more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light, family-oriented auction game. Too light to compete with Knizia's best (Ra, Amun-Re, and Modern Art), but much more accessible and suitable for those outside of the gaming hobby. It is fun and mildly challenging to complete your film with the oddball sets of talents and qualities you may acquire. In my experience, completing many bad to mediocre films rather than working to formulate good films is the more sure path to victory.

I played the Hollywood Blockbuster version, which has some production issues and could be funnier than it is. If playing the Dream Factory version raises the fun factor significantly, I could easily bump this game up a point.

Is it just me or does the theme here seem really erratic? I think HB wants to be funny but it's like Napolean Dynamite (which I hated but some love) just plain stupid. 

Allow me to elaborate.

The theme spends all of it's energy on funny names for the actors and films but then throws random stars at people with little consistency. For example; Forest Gump makes sense with 4 stars but Shawshank Redemption makes no sense at 2 stars. Tarintino is given 4 stars as a director and yet his most famous film, Pulp Fiction, is given only 2 stars. 

If you're are going to make it a mocking theme then do it right. Give all the critically successful films/actors low stars and all the crappy blockbusters films/actors high stars. Or you could do it the other way around. It feels like the design team had little to no knowledge of the film industry.

Good comedians understand what they're making fun of and are often times fans of the subjects they belittle. The feeling I get here is of someone who doesn't understand their own material but is just repeating something funny they once heard.

Everyone complains that Reiner games lack theme. Well now we know why. The game itself is merely okay but I dock it for its horrible mishandling of theme pasting.

My all-time favorite of all the games from the profilic German game designer, Reiner Knizia.  I've got to believe it's one of his favorites, too, since he put himself in the game as a -1 guest star!  The game oozes with theme, unlike its closest cousin, the very dry Ra.  I like the way the parties and the auction mechanics work, with the vertrags recirculated among the losing bidders.  I enjoy this game each and every time I play it, win or lose, and find myself always excited the moment the lot with the Marilyn Monroe tile comes up for bid!

Ohmigod!  A Knizia game where the theme actually enters the game play!
Players try to assemble elements of movies by "buying" them in auctions.
Different movies may require different mixes of actors, music, SFX, cinematography.
Each one will have from -1 to 4 stars which contribute to the value of the movie.
Players get points for raw movie value, for best in genre, for best mid-game movie, for best directors, and for worst movie.
If you like Ra, you'll probably like this - but it isn't duplicative either.

RATING: 8
One from the heyday of auction games and Knizia. Lots of movie components are auctioned consecutively with two ‘parties’, i.e. hidden free tiles thrown in each of the four turns. Awards for the first movies, the best movies, best director etc. add different scoring dimensions in best Knizia manner. Quick-playing, important decisions, simple structure and surprisingly thematic. I really liked it although I came in last by a large distance in my first game with less than half the points of the winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Had fun playing the game, but this may have been the worst component moment I've ever experienced. I paid $60 for 200 little cardboard counters, a simple black pouch, and a small board. Even the trophies are just cardboard and a stand. Most disappointing box opening ever! But still a fun game, and I'm glad I got the one with recent stars.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'd heard good things about this game, and I agree with them.  A lot of fun (although the corny names might fall flat after a while) and challenging.  I think it will take several plays to see what things are good and bad to take, and money management.  A fixed pool of money is good and bad, as it does aid counters, and things do eventually even out.

Another fun auction game for my collection. The theme is really strong, but I believe the game is tough competitively for newcomers. The core mechanics are simple enough, but the distribution of the tiles for which you bid is a hidden factor unless you've played the game a lot. Experienced players will have a big advantage in determining appropriate levels of bids. To me this just isn't as elegant of a game as Modern Art or Medici.

I thought that it would be missing something with only 3, but it ended up being very tense and amusing.  Definitely a better game with 4 or 5 players, though.

RATING: 5
Caveat: based on less than 10 plays. I want to love this game but I see flaws. The main problem is that early auctions are critical. If you gain few stars your choices at parties are limited and this can reinforce itself. It is an element that makes sense in terms of flavour but that can impede game play. The auction system seems insufficient to balance the advantages of early stars as it often makes sense to spend all early contracts on them. Every time I have played there have been players who can't wait for the game to end because they are unable to complete their initial 3 movies while the early leaders are reinforced with extra films to complete. This is a shame because the use of a closed economy is intriguing and with small tweaks could balance the powerful early game. A potential solution is to increase the number of contracts. Another idea is to have party priority determined by stars in unfinished movies (after the movie is finished you are yesterday's news). The latter creates a disincentive to finish an early movie unless you can win a best film award from it and this reduces the probability of a runaway leader. No matter how good a theme is (and this one is great), a lengthy strategy game must be solid technically and avoid glaring weaknesses to make me want to purchase it.

RATING: 7
Hollywood Blockbuster Version.  My first impression was that I could hardlly open the box, maybe it was just my copy, but that thing is AIR TIGHT.  I wouldn't complain, but this will continue to be a problem, and I might have to split a spine in order to easily open the box...seriously it took two people to work it open.  Anyways, the whole game has a plastic appearance and pastel colors.  After getting into the box, my second impression was the board being much larger than it needed to be (which is a nuisance when you have to deal with an escalating number of films you're producing).  Then I had to figure out on another particular token which was the 6 and which was a 9 because they looked the exact same.  After Chris informed me, I drew a line under both numbers to avoid confusion.  Then there was the manual....it did a good job explaining the rules once you finally figured out the proper page order...it was a fold out sheet whose order was completely whack...so I drew page numbers in on it.

Once I got past all this frustration, playing the game was easy and on the light side.  Possibly comparable to Knizia's Ra, but not as deep.  Some people don't care for the fudged actor names (Leondard DiCupaJoe) and movie names (Lord of the Bling), but that's not a problem for me...and paste ups are now readily available. 

The closed economy lets you easily bid high, because you know you'll likely get the contracts all back in one of the following bids.  Whenever someone wins a bid, they evenly distribute their bidded contracts to the other players.  This alleviates limited decisions and resources...while at the same time passing on who can command the resources; providing for a much more forgiving, newby-friendly game.

My main complaint is HB's oversized board (3 times larger than necessary)...it proved to be a problem.  I ran out of places to put my films, and had to turn them sideways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game has a major flaw in that, if a player manages to get a huge movie early on, you may as well stop playing, as they can just keep scoring bonuses for that film over and over. On the other hand, it left me with the urge to play again, so it can't be all bad.

After a second game, I have to say I like the aspect of trying to fill in the slots on your screenplay, but it really isn't the best auction game out there.

Another Knizia auction game, more than competent but one more than I need. Curiously, the theme bothers me - rather the flavor. Perhaps because of Show Manager, I feel that The Feel is really missing here, especially as this is one I wanted to (and did) trot out with the not-so-much-gamer-as-game-for-a-try in-laws.

RATING: 6
In some ways, the recent edition's parodied actors and film names are less interesting than the classic films and actors of Traumfabrik.  The icon for special effects is also a little questionable.

The game itself is still pretty enjoyable with a nice zero-sum economy and a not-immediately-obvious focus on winning awards.  There's a decent dose of luck, and the gameplay does change a bit as the number of players varies.

RATING: 7.5
[2007.Dec.18] This auction-based gateway game by Reiner Knizia has an easy-to-digest theme and is made to played by the masses. As one might expect, the good Doktor knows how to prescribe just the right dosage of game: enough for the gamers to feel like they're not wasting their time and light enough for the non-gamers to stay at the table. This is a Knizia classic through-and-through. Players bid against one-another to hire the best (or worst) directors, actors, and special effects shops (to name a few categories) to create the best films in the game. Will your film get an Oscar or a Razzie? Play Hollywood Blockbuster and find out.

An essential Knizia auction game.  Dripping with a theme (rare for this designer) that's both novel and has mass appeal.  Faster and lighter than Ra (the other big Knizia auction game) with nice strategy and impressive accessibility.  A must have game to play with family and more casual crowd.  Simple rules and quick games make this a must have.  I have the Filosofia edition which has awesome color art.  I'm glad I got this and that I went for the latest version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Traumfabrik or Fabrik der Traume, I think, are the best editions to get (they use actual film titles & actors names since there's no copyright enfringement in Europe).  An excellent auction game and it's usually extremely "entertaining" to play.  The theme is the Golden Age of Hollywood and it is one of my favorite for games and themes.  An underrated game IMO as there are several subtle strategies involved, things to watch out for and it scales well for 3 thru 5.  Adding to it's underratedness is the fact that if 1st and 2nd place has a 10pt difference, that's close b/c that means there was one large award (10pts) or two small awards (5pts each) between each player's end score.  Also, it can be won by hoarding all the contracts (which are VPs) and making only 2 or 3 films (not primary strategy), or you can win by making a bunch of lousy/mediocre films in volume.  Getting awards is important and if split up evenly amongst several players, end score can be very close.  The nuances lies in understanding how to win awards by being vigilant of who is trying to win at what genre/categories of each type of film and knowing who's holding lots of contracts.  Again, IMO underrated b/c of many aspects.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy all of Knizia's auction games.  Reminds me a bit of Showmanager/Atlantic Star in that one seeks to complete higher level movies in three different categories and bonus awards are also provided for the first movie made of each type as well as other awards.  Six auctions and two parties make up 1/4 of the game for a total of 24 auctions and 8 parties.  Only completed movies count in the scoring.

RATING: 7
Rating is for Traumfabrik, not the chintzy re-make "Hollywood Blockbuster", which I'd not be interested in playing, purely for aesthetic reasons.

This is a good, straightforward auction game with multiple paths to victory and where you have to watch your priorities.

It doesn't have the multi-dimensional juggling of Ra, nor the web of interdependencies of Modern Art.  But it's more streamlined and accessible than those two, and its theme trumps both.  

My one beef with the production is I wish they'd picked actual directors for the 3, 2, 1, and 0 star director chips, as they did with all the other actors.  How fun it would be to bid on Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, and Ed Wood!  Seems to me a major, needless mistake.

RATING: 5
As a movie buff I thought this game would be a good way to connect two of my passions - gaming & movies. I hesitated getting the Hollywood Blockbuster edition because of all the "fake" actors/directors. After looking at scans of the tiles I concluded the new names were clever puns of famous people. Finally, I liked the idea that if you win an auction you pay the winning bid to your opponents. Very clever.

In the end, however, it all fell flat. I must be missing something because I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It is an auction game where the theme seems to get in the way. Paying the bid to the other players is clever as is the star payout system. Stars are somewhat unique. If I score a 10, then you score a 10, you must take the next lowest instead (i.e., a 9 in this example). Neither of these mechanisms were clever enough to mask the confusing way movies are made in the game.

Jan 2005, from Ludotopia.com. Excellent game! After the first play, we immediately wanted to design the tiles for Asia movies!

Now we used the paste-on from BGG. The 3 players games was much much better than the 2 players games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like most Knizia games this is fairly abstract. However, the closed economy of paying your winning bid to the other players, with this the only way to earn revenue adds additional interaction and consideration of when you should call it quits: you can indirectly control who wins or loses bids later down the line. The awards for making movies first or best in a category also helps to add at least a tid bit of theme to the game, and causes decisions of timing when to do what, as you can't just hoard up and put all the final pieces at the end of the game. Getting directors and actors early seems to be very important and I think should be advised to new players beforehand.

Knizia is at it again but this time players compete as movie producers.  You must bid for all the necessary component to complete your film and win the most awards.  Fast and entertaining.  Not sure I like it as much as Knizia's other auction game (Modern Art) but the subject matter is appealing.

Reiner Knizia set collection game where you are trying to put on movies.  You gather actors, actresses, scripts, special effects, directors, etc. to put on the best movie you can.  You gain these through auctions, but there is a closed economy so the money goes to other players.

Of all Knizia's classical auction games, this one is probably the lightest but also the most popular one. With 3 different prints you can never go wrong with this game!

I love this auction game.  It's a little bit too long to be considered a filler, but the theme is FANTASTIC.  One of the people in my gaming group got a copy that was re-skinned so that all the actors have the actual picture and name of the actor instead of the stupid pun names.  Dana Carvey being worth negative points is sooo hilarious to me.

Argh.  It always seems to come down to the parties.  Last time I played, my scripts only had room for 3 actors, making it impossible to keep up with the actor race. 

I also don't like how easy it becomes to make a bad movie toward the end, as the lower tiles get taken up and a 6 becomes a 2...

I suck at bidding games--I'm so cheap I can't even spend pretend money, so I never take the risk, which means I never get a big win.

Nice enough game, especially as a gateway game.  There's just something that feels "missing" for me here though.  I really like other Knizia games a whole lot, but this one just feels "emptier."  I keep meaning to do new paste-ups of contemporary Hollywood types, thinking that might do the trick, but I never get around to it.

Game in a Nutshell: Build a movie cast by auctioning for the different parts. When a person wins an auction, all the others split the spoils and continue playing. Awards are given for 'Best' films.

Played as: 4,5 player

Pros: Fun theme. Simple auction mechanic makes the game really easy to jump into and leaves the primary focus on the building aspect of the game (often the the most satisfactory and fun part of any game). The trophy stands are nice, as well as all components, and feel good enough when won someone might feel like giving an awards speech. I think best of all though is the excellent economic structure that never allows anyone to feel high and dry as money is constantly trickling your way.

Cons: There's nothing groundbreaking-ly original here. Just a plain-jane game with some pretty cardboard art. The auctions intensity lessens as players fill their filmstrips up and it becomes obvious what few things each player needs to finish their films. Really, overall, it felt like the least interactive auction game I've played so far and pretty hard to keep peoples focus with.

Other: Probably an over-rated game. There's not enough going on in the game outside the auction and even that wasn't done all the interestingly. RA is by far the definitive auction game as far as I'm concerned and the only thing this game offers over that is theme.

Best Use: An easy, light family-friendly for four or five when theme can sell to a crowd more-so then fancy mechanics.

RATING: 7
A Knizia one. At first I was quite excited with this (likely in part because I'm a big movie fan), but then it felt "explored" quicker than I would have thought at first. Still, likely the first choice if I should bring something to the table for non-gamers who are not into plastic monsters and furniture (hello, nephew!). If they can take this, next step is Dominion.

By the way, it's in some ways even more fun if you just put the crew chips face down on all fields, and not just the parties. It's highly unlikely that you will score a perfect movie this way since you cannot plan exactly, but on the other hand it prevents AP which is not the worst for the target group. In essence, it moves from resource management to risk management a bit.

RATING: 7
Middleweight bidding game; I'd put it in the same category as Modern Art and Ra altough it doesn't have much in common with either. I like the way money is redistributed, however I find that to do well, you have to keep track of the open spots on every player's movies as well as each uncompleted movie's running total, which can create a lot of downtime. The first party comes in too early, often times the player who "wins" it will have the most guest stars/actors for the rest of the game.

Good gateway auctioner with a fun theme.  Although it's fairly light it still provides tough competition for experienced players.  Traumfabrik contains better stars than the new version.  If they came out with an indy film version (Von Trier, Cronenburg, Mifune, etc.) I'd be stoked.  UPDATE: knocking off a 1/2 point.  Would rather play other Knizia auction games.

Hollywood Blockbuster: a so-so Knizia game based around group bidding.  I'm none too good at this sort of Knizia mechanic, and the game was slightly more miss than hit for me.  I wouldn't consider buying it -- very much for folks who enjoy that sort of bidding aspect.

Quick bidding game.  Quite Kinizian with a slapped on theme, but the production of the pieces do create a flavor of filming.  Play with five to get the tension that keeps the game enjoyable.

The punny names sank this otherwise accessible and potentially popular theme. The game itself fell flat. We found [boardgame=12589][/boardgame] much easier to get into, and its theme was even more fun.

UPDATE: Just played this again, and it's not bad. In fact, I'm surprised I don't like it more. Perhaps the theme is too accessible for the game you're actually playing, which is quite dry. Had this been about developing agriculture in Mesopotamia, it probably would have been a hit for me.

Played the German version, which has the real actors, directors and movie titles. Not a bad game, kind of fun to make alternate history movies. Still it is a collection/auction game with a Hollywood theme.  Might be a nice way to get non-gamers into these kinds of games.  I don't think the American version with the made-up titles, etc would be quite as fun.

RATING: 8
The theme and the auction mechanisms work really well together to make a game that should appeal to a wide variety of gaming tastes, including non-gamers. For example, the struggle for the worst film is hilarious but it also requires good planning. Owners could customise the game to include actors and films from a number of eras. I'd love to see one done of 70s films. The only problems is that there are SO many actors who would qualify for the -1 star!
As such, this is my choice to use as a gateway game because it introduces a light auction system and point-scoring mechanisms that are so prevalent in many eurogames, but the theme is attractive enough for casual or non-gamers to relate to.
> Updated to a 9. I've had good success in using this as a gateway game.

Cool theme, but a little too simple for me. Sort of feels like the training wheels version of Ra, and I would much rather just play Ra if given the choice. I kind of dislike the shared contract pool also, though I'll admit it works pretty well. That all being said, this is perhaps Knizia's most thematic design. The silly combinations of stars and movies that come out of this game is mildly entertaining, but it felt more like window dressing than anything else.

A thematic auction game with close economic system. The decisions-making and tension it brings are sufficient for a light-medium game. The theme appeals to a lot of the gamers as well.

RATING: 6
Originally callued Traumfabrik, this game by Knizia is based on where one bids for directors, actors, cameras, specials effects tokens to complete movies. The neat mechanic is that the winning bid is split up evenly among the players. This game was republished as Dream Factory, and then Hollywood Blockbuster, which speaks for it's popularity. 

Whoever has the most actor points gets to pick first at the party, wherby in actor point order players choose tokens from the party pool. VPs awarded for first completed color movies, largest movies, largest director points, worst movie. Interesting mechanic where the winning bid is divided up amongst the other players. A lot of it is risk, since the party pool is hidden, if one bids high to get first pick there, there maybe nothing worthwhile. 

When this game game first came out, it was a neat trying to produce movies with different requirements. It had an easy theme that is easy to grasp, and the movie names and actors are known, and are humorous. However after repeated playings, this game seems to have gotten old, since there is luck in what is at the party. Sometimes you get caught in a bidding war with someone who is out of the game, and the party adds an uncertainty element. If people overbid, you can't win by hoarding contracts, though you might win another bid cheaply. 

I think the things you have to decide on is do you finish movies quickly to get more movies and the associated first movie points, or do you produce blockbuster movies to get the big movie points. 

Nowadays, I would prefer to play another game with more strategic depth.

I really like auction games, and I liked the party mechanic in this where you can recruit stars based on how good you are at the moment. I've only played once, but it was a lot of fun, though I didn't know any of the directors. I kind of wish it was a theme more relateable to me (I don't like movies that much and hardly know any actors names). I dislike actors a bit as well because I like references in games I own to have non-ending longevity/universal longevity (EX: if I have a kid in 20 years, he wont know the actors names so he won't get the same enjoyment someone nowadays might. This is an issue I have with games like Times Up and Cards against Humanity, which have very "pop" references)

Gameplay wise, I love that your opponents' contracts are given to you if they win a bid - it keeps the money system closed, and it powers up the players who dont get certain items. The edition I played was German so I didn't know the names either (I think it was called Traumfabrik) but I liked the pictures and thematic tokens shaped like contracts. That was neat.

Plays: 1

Have a Disney PNP version I've played twice at 3/5p. It's not as good as my first time but okay ish. I think sometimes an advantage can pile up a bit but I do like there are at least two approaches. The theme is fun but the novelty of the auction sadly wore off. Still enjoyable but not a top game atm or anymore. I still believe auction games are self balancing though.

Yes, even though it is another auction game that revolves around set collection, the theme of making movies and gathering actors, special effects, directors, music and other stuff, is appealing.  I like how the board looks and the tiles.  It is pretty good.

I don't like the limited amount of movie scripts.  It's sort of a timer element that if you take too long working your initial set, you might miss out on extra ones with faster opponents taking them.  I would have rather seen a bigger number of scripts.

Hollywood Blockbuster edition.  Movie 'A' needs a director, special FX guy, actor, actress, and a random spot. The game is essentially just bidding over and over on various sets of tiles you need to complete the different movies you are making.  While there was some strategy involved it felt kind of...incomplete as a game.  The scoring was rough with the awards, and how everyone gets constant influx of cash was weird to me.

I thought the game was rather bland.

After one play it seems like this is a decent auction game. With all of the knowledge of what the future auctions are, you can make some planned decisions. However, the importance of having actors to get the best items at parties can make the game feel unbalanced.

(I own Hollywood Blockbuster-edition)

It's a good auction game with a movie theme. Money system is interesting as bids are divided evenly between your opponents. You have to make some tight decisions since it's very hard to get just those things you need. Scoring is quite unforgiven as if the movie isn't completed then you get nothing out of it. On the other hand even some not-so-good movies can give you quite a lot of points in the form of awards. Especially fun is the battle for "the worst movie" award. Works very well with 4 or 5 players.

I really want to like this game as it has a great theme and a nice "look".  It just seems to fail to entertain new players more often than not, so I really wonder why I need this in my collection.    

A warning:  Don't ever play this game with anything less than 4 players.  It falls flat with 2 or 3.

RATING: 7
Possibly the least convincing of Knizia's auction games, but that's still head-and-shoulders above anything else. My main issue is with the timing of the game: it seems about half a round too long and too many players are left to idle at the end (although, it has to be said, the wealth distribution mechanic helps enormously with this). But the auction elements are sterling stuff, and the characterisation of the game is second to none: proof that Knizia does theme in his own delicate but intuitive way.

An auction game and a very good one.  I love the closed economy and I love how the production chips will vary from game to game and location to location.  I have the Uberplay version and it seems to be slightly... over produced.  This ties Ra as my favorite auction game.

A Knizia classic. A simple ruleset (with exceptions for chrome) and emergent play properties. The closed economy is the unique point here, and it's a good Knizia mechanic. The game has a tendency to tell a story, whether it's the indie studio that put out one big hit and could never quite follow it up properly, or the AAA movie house with 3 movies stuck in development hell.

Better than Ra for me, though both are excellently designed.

RATING: 5
It’s like a grown up Don. Place 7 or so auction groups face up on the board, auction off the first, spread the winning bid around the other players, auction, auction, auction, auction, auction, auction. Mid way thru, and at the end of the round, 5 face-down tiles are revealed and each player gets to choose one in order of who’s won the most ‘star actor’ tiles so far.

The problem with the spread-the-winnings mechanism is that it accentuates luck. In our 5 player game you knew you could only compete in 1 or 2 auctions in a round. If 2 auctions you want are spread apart, you might have a chance at winning them. If they’re close together, you’ve got buckleys on the second as the other players will be cashed up with the winnings from the previous bids they didn’t win, whereas you’ll be cashed down. And if there’s one auction you absolutely want to win and save up your cash for ... and get beaten by one point by someone else saving up for it ... huge frustration factor. It seemed to happen regularly. Then where do you go for this round?

There’s potential for interesting auction decisions. But it seemed frustrating and pointless to an extent and there was none of the interesting auction psychology that you usually get in such games. One of the reasons was that usually half of the players were not able to compete in any given auction making the auctions relatively dull ... 2 players stepping it up step by step. And it was just relentless dull auction after dull auction. I’m singing in the rain, but I’m singing the blues.

A clever little auction game that has a great theme, who doesn't dream of making their own movies, and getting awards for their efforts.

This has everything I like: strategic choices, consistent narrative theme, good graphic design (I have the German Traumfabrik version), very tough auction valuation, and subtle scoring.  It has a wonderful zero-sum monetary system that defies clear analysis (i.e. there are frequent painfully difficult choices). My girlfriend seems to have found the secret to it quickly on our first game and won by a very wide margin.

This is an excellent medium weight Knizia, up there with RA. It feels a lot like RA in fact (although it is different in bidding, set collection, and currency mechanics, that is to say everything). But it has that same wild feeling of badly wanting some chit and scheming to acquire it while hoping it won't break your bank account.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This auction game is about trying to create various "movies" composed of various actors and other features.  The bidding happens in lots, and each person's movies need different parts, so people will value different lots differently.  It's really good to complete your movies early so you can hit the early bonuses, but at the same time, you want to make them as good as possible, which may take longer.  I do like the light-hearted theme, too.

2/21/10: Wow, I really didn't like this game at all.  I played the new Rio Grande version.  The names aren't funny.  I was hoping for Mad-level humor, and I didn't even get Cracked-level humor.  More importantly, the game was just boring to me.  I like auctions fine (and I actually really like Ra), but the way you use the rewards from the auction just didn't appeal to me at all.  And the scoring sytem with the trophies for various movies also felt incredibly weak and made the game blander than it should've been.

Actually a really good auctioning game. Theme is different and catching - it's not always easy to find proper equipment for filmmaking.

Definitely will play again. With playtime squeezed to 45 min... this would be rated eight!

RATING: 7
Fun Knizia auction game. It's the most 'pure auction' among his games that I've played: in Ra the fight for position is most important, Modern Art is about shaping the market to fit your hand, but in Dream Factory it's all about knowing how much you want to bid at each spot. When do you keep back, and when do you fight over it.

This makes Dream Factory not as good as the other games, but it's certainly not boring. Creating movies, figuring out a plan, and fighting the others over tiles - or backing off and making a new plan - are a lot of fun.

The rules aren't very difficult, the game doesn't last too long, it's easy to see what you want to be doing, you're never out of the race only because you bid too much or not enough, and even if you're dead last you've still created some movies and made a bunch of points. I can certainly recommend Dream Factory as a lighter, easier auction game.

Plus, the Traumfabrik version is beautiful and even comes with a soundtrack on cd. Awesome!

Humour of the game is dependent on knowledge of stars and movies portrayed. Scores are fractured making status foggy, so lacks any competitive tension for those who don&#039;t discern.

[Note:  I've only played the German version "Traumfabrik", not the American version yet.]

This is a game with a very intersting theme and rather novel auction mechanics. A fun game to play, which at the same time posed some tough decision making and rewards short- and long-term planning. The auctions and the tiles that come up during "party" auctions create a somewhat loose game condition that is difficult in which to have lots of control. So, you just try the best you can to win best tiles you can.

A very entertaining game overall.
I'm hoping to play the new 2006 English version to see if removing the famous actor names is detrating from the game compared to the original game.

Played the Traumfabrik version and was surprised how simple this game actually is. At its heart, it is nothing but a tile collecting game with an auction mechanic. Yet, theme theme makes it more exciting than your average farmer fare. I still think the game could have done with a bit more interaction but I suppose with more plays, the players will start looking out for each others' productions to be to a higher extent, hoping to grab the film awards first and ending up with the best film in the respective genres. Definitely a little gem when played with film fans.

Full of tough decisions and multiple paths to victory, just what I like in a game.  Players interact by taking the resources the other players are trying to get.  I could wish for a little more direct interaction, along the lines of Boomtown though.  Unfortunately it felt a little too 'random' in the effect of what was available when, and how it fit into the cards you drew.  I didn't feel like I had much control over anything that happened in the game, yet I took 2nd of 4 players, almost winning. Overall, an interesting game that I'll give another try before I decide whether I like it or not.

Wow, a Knizia game with a REAL theme! This one is good - great fun having Marilyn Monroe starring in a SFX-ladden "Grapes of Wrath" directed by Hitchcock. The english version sounds disappointing with its parody of stars. 

It's also a typical Knizia bidding game, although more straightforward than Ra or Modern Art. Just plain old open bidding. It makes for a good game, but it does lack some of the former's tactical flavour (perhaps because it was a mainstream release?). While fun now, I'd question its long-term replayability.

However without the theme it would be a bland auction game lacking the tension of Ra or the psychology of Modern Art, and even with it is not thrilling.  The auction of mixed lots means that luck can play a substantial role, a bit like Medici.  In a way I think more could have been done with the theme - have the actors appear in multiple movies with their star rating slowly changing - then you could really crow when Jane Russell gets to steal the Oscar from Ingrid Bergman!

The movie theme fits well here and the length of the game seems right on target.  There's a good, solid game here that non-gamers can approach due to the familiar subject matter and funny "movies" that result.  I have the consistent problem of accumulating money and never spending it - gotta' work on that.  Fun game that I'm looking forward to playing again soon!

This game looks like a light part game and plays more like an auction abstract.  Theme could really be anything although I'm not sure there is an optimal theme to make sense with the mechanics.  That being said it's a good auction game that is easy to learn and has good interesting decisions throughout.  There is a nice mix of tactics and strategy as you can't lose sight of either because both have there share of rewards.  Good game that is almost a filler with experience players.

RATING: 7
 From a technical standpoint, the game is only above average, in my book.  Figuring out the value of the auction lots is fun, but that's all you do for the ENTIRE game.  There are about four/five different strategies that you can employ.  Once you've explored them all, every game is the same thing over and over again--one player focuses on actors, one focuses on quick production, one on quality production, one on being frugal with money. 

 But traumfabrik is special, and goes beyond the normal game for two reasons:  1. the theme is BEYOND perfect, and still the rules are very simple!  it feels very much like you're there making movie magic happen from the business end.  2.  Unlike many other auction games, this is an easy one for new players to pick up.  Most auction games require knowing the percent of different types of things in the bag that are up for auction.  In traumfabrik  you get to see what's coming up for the next quarter of the game, so that kind of tedious knowledge is not necessary.  Also, it's easy to determine the 'base' value for a particular auction (each star you see up for auction should be worth roughly (very roughly) one contract), and new players can bid at least in the right ballpark without knowing too much about the game.

 Finally, I should note that this is very much a strategic game--almost no tactics.  You will never hear anyone say 'ohhh that was really clever of you.' Instead, you'll hear, "damn you, why did you make me spend so much for this lousy music score??"

Interesting game. Light on rules and fun to play. I enjoy this, but I have yet to decide if there is actual skill in winning. I think luck and some good bluffing is all you need. Still, it's fun each time we play so I give it a thumbs up. Works well for family games.

Quality Knizia auction game. I like that money never leaves or is added to the game- it simply shifts around from player to player. Knowing that high bids will aid your opponents creates additional elements to think about while bidding. Balancing out wanting to finish movies quickly for awards in the current round with the patience to put on a high quality product is always an interesting dilemma.

One of my favorite auction games.  I love how the losers received the winning bid divided evenly - really encourages you to push up bids, not just to make your opponent waste money, but to earn yourself more money.  And it's also great that it is a closed system - no money in or out.  The theme also works really well and makes it much more interesting than most other auction games where the units you're bidding for are pretty meaningless.  Many of the puns are pretty bad, but it's great to make funny combinations - Superdude starring the voice of guest star Christopher Walken.  We joke there should be more -1 star actors.

I really enjoyed this.  With the uberplay version, jokes abound and the general atmosphere is light hearted which may help a family game overcome the bidding aspect for an enjoyable evening.

My kind of game through-and-through, another great entry from Knizia (my favorite designer).

It reminds me of Ra, though it is not quite so good as that. I'd boost the rating by one if I was at a table full of people looking carefully at everyone's boards and really making smart bids (like my game group does when playing Ra).

I suppose you could damn this by saying (and this is one of MY favorite lines): "why don't we just play...XXX." Ra, in this case. Fair enough. So this is just for when you want to mix it up a bit, go a tiny bit lighter and enjoy the theme.

Normally an auction game is not my type, but this one is exceptionally good. The theme is interesting, producing movies and hiring stars and contesting for Oscar. The cash-flow system is unique: we play with a certain amount of money and there's no way of injecting additional cash into the game. The money only flows within players. And we can also sense humour of the designer. Greatly done.

Another auction mechanic in Traum I liked are auction mechanics where you spend victory points (ie. money) to earn victory points (ie. stars). Most auctions have an annoying mechanic where you convert Resource A to Resource B, and only Resource B grants you victory points. It's annoying because you need to be familiar with the resource structure of the game to make a proper bid.

And Traumfabrik's closed auction system is *nice*. I have a tendency to hoard money in games with money, but this paid off in the late-game, when I could blow cash to get those bonus points I wanted, yet up the bidding to force others to pay more money for the bonus points *they* needed. And, when they paid for it, they filled my coffers. With victory points. Muhahahaah.

Fun, light game, recommended even for those who hate auction games (like me!).

A pure auction game of pure genius! Each round 6 different sets of items are auctioned off, with the winner evenly distributing the money he paid to the other players. The items go in "movies" that are trying to be completed for points. Each item is rated 1-3 (with a few 4 rated Directors), with the rating being how many VP's its worth. Each player starts with 3 movies he/she is trying to complete, with each movie calling for different elements, such as a director and 2 actors, or Director, Actor, Special Effects, and Music, etc. Only lasting 4 rounds, its an intense, yet fun, action packed game!

I thought it was Chris Lawson's website where I saw this one, and that it was supposed to make the game more balanced....but I have been frustrated in finding that again."

Plays nicely. The board looks dull, but the possibility of casting famous and beloved movies with totally different actors and directors, underline it with a cheap score and cheesy special effects is a big part of the fun. It is therefore necessary to have (or make it yourself with the data provided here) the version with the name plates of the real actors/directors. The CD with music from Hollywood's Golden Age is a great extra, and - funny enough - often has run through, when the game has just ended. I just wonder, if I will ever get more than the "Oscar" for the worst movie...?
Gateway game.

After one play with 5 players I don't think this game is very good at that number. The economy runs in a way that generally players just get $2 per auction, which feels like it takes too long to regain funds. I like the game, the theme is cute, the board is superfluous, but I want to play with 3.

The parody names are crap as well. I'm not at all interested in this, thank god I've got the original Traumfabrik!

Very fun. I don't often like auction games after the first play, but I did like this one. I felt like I knew where I was relative to other people at most times, and I felt like I always knew around how much to bid (very rare for my 1st time with a new auction game!) The theme is great! Wish they had bothered to get some licenses and made the game as pretty as Traumfabrik.

----------

Lowered rating from 8 to 7 after 3rd play. All 3 plays have been with 5 players, and I don't like it. Too many films to keep track of, and you win fewer auctions (makes the counter mix in each loot more luck-based, but does force you to place your chips carefully).

My first game experience with the GSG crew and it was excellent.  I've never played a true auction game and this was an excellent one.  Great interaction that has a bit of a poker feel to it.  I also liked the closed economy - whatever money you bid gets divvied up among the other players.  Very neat!

On a 2nd play, this goes further up.  I really like the theme and it's just a whole lot of fun.  Another key fact is that it isn't overly long (75-90 mins or so).

Traumfabrik is one of the numerous Knizia auction games; he seems to have developed the definitive sense of how to do these right, and this one is done right. Like Ra (also Knizia) and many other new auction games, the basic system is always: tiles flipped up in groups, worth differing amounts to each player as the game progresses, earlier rounds score less than later rounds but are crucial to building a good base, and the tokens used to bid with are recycled back into play and worth points in their own right.

All in all, after spending some time figuring it all out, it was a lot of fun. However, like Ra, it must be played sparingly. Not top tier, but not everything can be, can it?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fairly simple game where players bid on various movie elements (actors, directors, soundtracks etc.) to complete screenplays and try to outdo rival studios in terms of ratings. The twist is that the game functions on a closed economy, so the winning player divides his bid among the other players.

An important aspect to note is that completing a highly rated movie early is very valuable, and the player who does so can possibly end up as a runaway leader. To prevent this, other players must be shrewd enough to make that player pay a premium price for the winning bid, thereby making it difficult for him to win future auctions. 

There are two minor problems with this game: the first is that the game feels a little repetitive, since it's the same style of auction round after round, with the only difference being the rating values up for grabs. Secondly, the last round in the game can be anticlimactic if most players have already finished their movies, or the components they need are not turning up.

The wacky Hollywood theme fits the light nature of this game well, although you could really swap the theme around. Dream Factory is not the strongest or most dynamic of the big box auction games available, but fares well as a gateway to more complex auctions.

[6 plays] In our first 4 player game with Brad and Kerri, everyone picked up on the rules quite easily and we launched into our first game without problems. Very fun amd fast moving. I now know why Traumfabrik was so well respected. Similarities to RA, but different enough to accomodate both games in my collection. Theme and less complexities here may be more inviting to casual gamers than RA.

Having no experience with the original version, I enjoyed Uberplay's production of the game and am very glad to have it.

UPDATE: The 2 player game works OK, although there are definitely better casual 2 player games. The psychology of not wanting to give up too much buying power is interesting.

Most recent plays 12-25-09 with Barb and Davis clan.

Own the version with the CD.

A VERY VERY light Kniza auction game. Well, he did design it for Hasbro.

It's the golden age of the american studio film days and players are heads of studios trying to bid for actors, directors, effects and music to complete various films.

Points for films are tallied according to the 'stars' on each of the chips that are used in the making of the film.

Additionally, there are extra awards to best films in each genre and to the best overall direction as well as the worst film.

Players who nab at least 2 of the best film of each round and one of the other final bonuses will do well to win.

Reiner Kniza has a guest star as a -1 guest star. Use him to make your dud film and get an extra 10 points at the end!

I've only played this once, but it is a solid bidding game.  I also found the parody of Hollywood to be rather funny.  I guess the latter part will wear off in time, but for now this is a very enjoyable game.  It also strikes me as being a good gateway game since the rules are relatively simple and the theme is fun.

Auction. One 5p game so far. Enjoyed it - solid auction game. I thought it would be a lot easier to explain than RA but I'm not so sure... there was some confusion over just which production chips were which. But once you get going, there aren't any twists in gameplay (like some tiles being discarded each epoch in RA). Humorous theme is definitely more accessible than RA, though.

Finally traded after it never got a second play.

This game combines many elements of others I've seen, such as Aqua Romana in which completing early can possibly reward you with more points. The bidding is 'interesting' in that you have a limited number of contracts, and when you spend them they are split between the other players. I quite liked this element, although I was very unsure of how much to bid. Probably not one I'll clamour for, but I won't mind playing if its on the table.

Steaming Turd of a game, Knizia's worst in my honest opinion.
Game cosists of 4 rounds of bidding on various uninteresting tiles that lose the comedy value very quickly. Then you have to place said won tiles onto movie boards. When you finish a movie board you score the movie.

Knizia egyik licitálós játéka. A játékosok filmeket készítenek, amihez az eszközöket különböző fajtájú liciteken keresztül szerzik meg. Sokféleképpen szerezhető pont, fontos a gyorsaság, de a jó film készítése is. A szép kivitellel kicsit bele is lehet élnie magát a játékosoknak a filmkészítésbe. Tetszett a megoldás, hogy nyerő licit elosztásra kerül a többi játékos között. Nagyon hasonló a Modern Arthoz, de a tematikussága miatt itt kicsit jobb élményt adott.

The theme of making movies is great (and very underused). Knizia's implementation here works well, although I find it very difficult to catch up in this game if I start to fall behind (because of how important actors are to the party spaces and how difficult it is to get more actors when you pick last at the parties). A good game to play with the family.

With it's new treatment, I anticipate looking back on this game in 40 years the way I look back at the 1960's edition of Clue. Stylish, but soon to be dated!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
In many ways this game is a better version of RA (Bidding on random flipped tiles, without knowing what the next set will be, trying to fulfill certain conditions to score, etc), lacking only the ingenuity of the bidding tokens.  

The theme is certainly better, but overall it felt a bit lackluster initially, but that is because I played it with 5 players the first time and never felt in control (and couldn't see what others were going for).  Over time I've discovered that the game has a much higher replayablility level than Ra. I feel that this game gives some direct sets of goals that you can shape by good gameplay.

Traumfabrik relies on the ability to drive the price up for auctions in order to make money back. This usualy works out for the best as two or three players are always looking to win what is in the pot.  And if you aren't interested, then this is where fancy talking comes in handy.

Certainly, this can be a frustrating games, especially when you have 3 pictures to close and no directors come up in the round. But, most things even out as you go, certainly much more than Ra.

After multiple plays and years of coming back to this game I'll say without a doubt that it demands to hit the table every few months.  While it just doesn't have the grace and elegence of Medici, I feel that it has a higher fun factor and is one of the best newbie intro games around.  Clean and intuitive. 

I do have to say that giving Burt Lancaster a 1 and Jimmy Stewart a 2 is pretty whack.
(This game drops to a 3 with 5 players)

(Traumfabrik.) Doesn't hit the table that often, but it does have staying power, and I always enjoy it. Although it is that rare beast among Knizia games, one with a three-dimensional theme, still the wire-frame shows through, and I'm sometimes left wishing there were a bit more texture. For instance, as much fun as it is to cast Cary Grant in On the Waterfront ("I could have been a contender, darling"), the miscasting has no impact on the value of the movie. Nonetheless the mechanics and scoring work well: in typical Reiner fashion, you are given complementary and even conflicting ways to get points -- for example, finishing movies quickly to get First Picture award (and another screenplay) vs. trying to maximize quality.

I've only played two-player, and although I'm sure it works much better with more, my wife and I have had fun with it. EDIT: Played with four and it was much better. I'm not sure how I came in second instead of last, but it was a good tense game. EDIT: After another play, it seems as if awards is the way to go, not quantity of movies.EDIT: It's dropped significantly as I compare it to other auction games I have that I'd much rather play. However, it works very well with my father-in-law and his s.o. as they are huge movie buffs.

Played only twice with more than six years between the two games, so my rating may change. Traumfabrik is a good auction game as only Knizia can design them. Money is sometimes tight, but you don't need to worry too much about it, as the economy is closed. It's more important to decide what you should be bidding on to enhance your final score. And it plays in less than an hour.

RATING: 6
Hollywood Blockbuster has a lot in common with Ra, but I like it far less. Both are Knizia bidding games, played in rounds, where you collect various types of counters and score them as groups. But Ra is more concise, and creates a lot more angst due to not knowing when the round will end. It also gives you that decision point each turn - do you call Ra or draw. HB just has auction after auction, and plods on to the finish. I know which one I'll be playing in future.

RATING: 7
[Hasbro 'Traumfabrik' 2000 Edition with CD] {Film-making; auction, set collection; optimal 5p} An interesting auction game with a strong movie-making theme. (Knizia has created a thematic auction game.) It's similar to RA in some aspects: closed economy, each bid collects a set of tile, etc but it's unique because you can allocate the tiles to different films. If RA uses horizontal collection, Traumfabrik uses vertical collection, instead. Decisions are agonizing in Traumfabrik because a player has to compete both for films, the best and the first film.

Continual bidding is very important because contract is only a tool to collect the materials for a film.  In addition, a player should get some actors and guess stars so that he could choose good tile in a party. Traumfabrik is multi-faceted and allows strategies such as going for more films, or the best/worst films. Besides, it's quite important to complete more films because the score is constrained by the players' available films. (without film, players can't get score.) I think the worst film is only good at middle to late game. 

Traumfabrik is very great with a group of strong or experienced players. In this case, the competition is very strong and very interactive. It's bad that it's OOP.

[Update] The new edition from Uberplay isn't attractive - I don't like fictitious names. The style of the bits is too comedic. I will stick to Traumfabrik.

After years still a good game, but only very solid. Nothing really special. Strong theme for Knizia. Like the cd with music to the game.

You must watch out for the actors. If you fall behind, it will be hard to come back and without actors it will be very hard to complete the movies that you want to finish.

If you have no money you will have fast similar amount than the other players, because when you win a bid you don`t pay to the bank, you pay to all other players.

Always a fun game. Auctioning at it's core, but the theme does an excellent job of distracting you that it. You end up considering that you need a good director or you won't be able to win an award with this movie instead of just getting "abstract commodity A" to complete "abstract project B".

Getting actors early seems important. Parties can keep you riding a nice wave when you can start grabbing a bunch of good actors and the guest stars at the parties.

I am partial to interesting auction mechanics - I rate RA as one of my absolute favorites - and Traumfabrik is a game that is easily accessible to people due to its theme.  People like envisioning what the classic movies would be like if remade with other actors/actresses, and that keeps the game light and fun.

It is probably 50% theme, and only 50% gameplay, but I really like this game.  Simple rules, and it plays fast.  It is also, after Razzia!, one of the best auction games for new players.  Too bad it is OOP (and after seeing some of the new actors, I'm glad I picked the original up when I got the chance).

Yet another excellent bidding game from Knizia.  I really like how the bidding works in this game.  Everyone has slightly different goals.  The goods are available to see and plan around.  And the winning bid gets split between the other players.  I really like this game, and I don't think it would be redundant to have this, Ra, and Modern Art all in the collection.

Upgraded rating. This game improves with repeated play and familiarity, and becomes exceedingy fun and balanced when all players are experienced with the mechanics. Many possible strategies and paths to victory. I like the original Traumfabrik edition far better than Hollywood Blockbuster, which I would rate a 6 at best. The Traumfabrik  edition vs. Hollywood Blockbuster (like Showmanager vs. Atlantic Star) is absolute proof that components and theme do matter in a game.

RATING: 8
Very accessible and enjoyable auction game since everybody likes movies. There are definitely several different strategies that work, so if one strategy gets thwarted early on, one can adapt and pursue a different one. Played once 2-player and three times with five. 2-players is so-so, but with more people, this one is a winner.

RATING: 6
With its accessible pop-culture theme, Hollywood Blockbuster seems like it would be Knizia's best auction game.  But it lacks the 1-bid tension of Ra or the bid variety of Modern Art.  Hollywood Blockbuster has the same bland auctions going round and round.  The generic movie titles and actors are a sanitized metaphor for the experience.

Ah Traumfabrik (the version I have), one of the best marriages of theme and game mechanics I have in my collection.  Traumfabrik is an auction/bidding game where the players are movie produces and attempt to score the most points by assembling directors, stars, music, fx in various combinations.  I suspect the Hollywood Blockbuster version may use generic stars instead of the famous real stars that were in the german version, so for an extra treat, download the star tile files here on BGG and make your own.  If you're looking for something that's not heavy but can have difficult decisions and is great to play with friends, give HB a look.

On Uberplay's Hollywood Blockbuster: Why do people love the old-timely movies so much better? I think the unlicensed, parody names of "modern" movies makes this one more relevant to a lot of people.

Lots of people I know don't think it is as funny to put Boris Karloff in a musical as it is to put Keanau in any movie.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Gah!  What is it with this game that makes me cringe in disgust.  It would seem to be a fun themed game of Hollywood movie making, but it just doesn't elevate with me.  Must be those damn parties, as I see all the stars go off with other players, while I'm stuck talking with a nerdy, board game playing special effects flunkie and a dork with a boom box who calls himself a movie scorer.

Although if I would just win one game of this...

I thought I would prefer Traumfabrik with its Golden Era stars and real-life film names, but now I'm thinking I want to keep Traumfabrik [b]and[/b] keep my copy of Hollywood Blockbuster. Both games have a lot of factors that make them great for new gamers - the theme is fun and the goals are intuitive, the payouts on auctions keep everyone in the game, and there is a pleasant tension between going for the early scores and banking on the big payoffs later.  There is a fair amount of luck in what comes up when, but the auctions give you some opportunity to mitigate chance, so both new and experienced gamers can enjoy.  HB gets the edge for newer gamers, though, with English components and goofy actor puns and artwork taking the edge off for those worried about "strategy games".

Along with Lord of the Rings, Knizia's most thematic game. Great game to introduce non-gamers to the world of Designer games. The past-ups are remarkable- no one noticed they were not part of the original game, and they enhance gameplay, IMO. Also download the superb rules translation. It looks just like the original rules, complete with identical graphics, only in English.

Ahhh a Knizia auction.   Fun theme.  THe new edition is incredibly overproduced, but in a fun way.  Played quite differently than I had in my head.  I'm a sucker for Knizia auctions, so this rating can only rise from here.  I'm sure there is depth... I just can't find it right now.  My final scores also reflect this.  I really really want to like this more, but so far so good is more of my reaction.   Tried with three, and I think thats the way to learn the insides of the game.  Its alot easier to get back into the bidding because the payouts from the other players are alot bigger . So its up to an 8 right now, could go back down to a 7 or keep rising.

I had the Hollywood Blockbuster version. I think I would have enjoyed the original, German version more. The other players enjoyed it. One of them is convinced that it would make a fairly decent gateway game because everyone loves movies and the funny stars should appeal to non-gamers. I'm not so sure. It felt to me that it was not any more strategic or tactical than an older movie making themed game (MovieMaker) I grew up on in the 80's. I will give this one a few more chances to convince me.

Hollywood Blockbuster version


Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents. These all get placed on players' film-strips, to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors, but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors, even worst film.

The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts as money, and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.

I played this at Origins 05.  Being relatively new to Euro Games means that I have played many of these game in reverse.  People who have been doing this for a while played this game years ago when every third game wasn't an auction game.  Me, I just played it, and this is the third game.  I liked it a fair amount, but one play did not reveal anything to make it stand out.  It's kind of unfair, but that's the frame of reference I have to work with.

Update: Rating reflects multiple plays now.  Some nice subtlties, but not too heavy.  It doesn't make you feel like you are making movies, but it is well themed non-the-less.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A quite unique auction game in that there is a fixed pool of money: winning bids are distributed evenly to the other players and there is no source of income in the game. In consequence, the game is all about planning ahead over the course of the round, knowing what you should win and for how much, and when it is and isn't okay to have money. The new Uberplay version is a bit of an eyesore and the jokey star names are just embarrassing.

RATING: 8
(sigh) With only the 2 of us, this game is a "challenge" to play.  I've come up with probably a half-dozen variants to try and make it play better with only two.  That's the problem with auction games I suspect.  It's a testament to Knizia (and the theme) that we keep plugging away!  Our current favorite variant uses UNO cards with the card distribution from Knizia's "Palazzo" to bid on Locations, and we don't use the Contracts at all.  I think it works better because you don't "know" how much money the other player has, which you always did with the 2p rules as-written.  Have to write up our Variant and post it someday.

An entertaining theme on an auction game, and the closed economy seems to make the game easier to play than some other auction games like Modern Art. It's quite entertaining going for the worst film. My only concern is whether the replayability is there once the novelty of the films wears out.

I'm tempted to retheme it with actual actor/film/director names and possibly change the other film elements (replace special effects with locations, replace sound with theme songs, cameras with props)

Funny, I guess. There are a lot of games that are better mechanically but the effort put into the caricatures makes this game more fun than your average game. Will not be fun if played too often, but I see myself playing this every now and then and will probably enjoy it. Especially suitable for play with inexperienced/casual gamers as it has laughs and very simple gameplay and rules. Will not stand up to the scrutiny of several plays as the core mechanics are too simple/poor and luck is a major factor.

Any interesting auction game.  Couldn't help but think of For Sale while I was playing.  It's more involved than For Sale.  I'm not usually a fan of bidding games but I found this one enjoyable.  The bidding is 0 sum in that your bid goes to you competitors.  Your competeing for various components of a movie.  Points are awarded for completed films and bonuses are given to first film and best film in each category. Also overall best film, worst film and best directors.UPDATE: Played the German Edition Traumfabrik.  It's much more aesthetically pleasing and much better themed.  I as many other BGGers would prefer to own the German edition.

I wasn't even looking at this game seriously until I got it in a trade for a game that I really didn't care for.  Now that I've played it, I'm kicking myself for not looking at it sooner.  Great simple fast game for new players with enough meat on it to satisfy the grizzled gamers.  I have the Hollywood Blockbuster edition, and I find that the theme and silly puns on the names are great for drawing in casual gamers.  Knizia really pulled off a coup with this very auction game, as it is simple, accessible, and replayable.

I like the game, especially the auction mechanism where the winning bid is distributed among the other players. I have almost exclusively played this with 5 and found it great at that scale, but I also hear that with 3 it is very good (although surely different in feel). 

Fabrik der Traume is a unique, very enjoyable game, and it gets extra points for being a very good gateway game.

Excellent theme, and I love the mechanic of bidding using only a fixed amount of cash for the entire game.  It can be frustrating, though, in part because the parties seem to dictate a "rich get richer" mechanism, and also because the quantity vs. quality approach seems to be THE game-winning strategy.  It seems like every time I play this game, I change its rating.

This is typical Knizia auction fare, reminiscent of High Society, but with a much more interesting theme, that of producing movies. The film titles of the screenplays players are building are all fairly groan worthy puns, but there are quite a bit of fun moments in the fantasy casting of these movies. Clint Eastwood as Forrest Gump? Quentin Tarentino directing Groundhog Day? This sort of thing makes for a lot of funny dialogue as players (especially film buffs) take their turns in what would otherwise be a pretty dry experience.

It does feel a little over produced, as I'm sure this could have been sold as straight up card game in a small box, if they had wanted to do so. That's a pretty minor quibble though, as all in all it's a fast playing and solid entry in the Knizia portfolio.

Lights, camera, action...

Finally played it. Loved it. Fun, quick, and movie themed! What's not to love?

3/25/05 - Update: Although I really like this game a lot, there can be big problems if the actor situation is unbalanced in the beginning and sets up a very lucrative Party on turn one - which in turn snowballs and creates a run away victory.

8/16/05 - Ixne the above remark. I discovered that I was playing wrong. Need to keep the tiles turned upside down until proceeding to auction them. That makes for a much tighter and balanced game.

Hmm..played again,  the auction was better.  Turns out still have a rule wrong - the contracts are worth VP at the end!   Likely would make the bidding much more tense.

A very simple to play auction game that works by recycling the money from the player who spent it to the other players. Film industry theme works. More of a filler than a main game but well worth playing.

I'm excited to give the Disney expansion found on here in the files section a try.  I think more non-gamers will be open to this game with a different theme like that.  I just want to make the pieces as professional looking as possible.

I like some of the idea behind this game: a closed-economy auction system, some set-collection/point maximization engine, the "Hollywood studio" theme. Overall, I think the game was just lacking a little in terms of player interaction. I think its a solid game that just isn't my style.

Really neat little auction game. Relatively easy to teach and people like winning trophies (even if they don't win the whole game)

Really like this one.

RATING: 6
The auction mechanism (where the high bid gets distributed amongst those who didn't win) is brilliant.
But the game feels repetitive to me: there was no real sense of advancement throughout the game. Just repeat the same actions over and over.
Also, there was perhaps a little too much luck involved for a game of this type. ("I just needed a Sound tile to finish my movie and, well, none of them showed up on the board.")

simple rules, real fun !
if u love cinema this is a must, if u don't know old movies this (and some curiosity) is the place from where to start. if u don't like auction games, try this one: it is simple , fast and fun. Giving out prizes at the end of the game is so great, expecially if u want to act out as the enterteiner.

We are producers of cheesy movies in a pure auction game to create the highest value scripts. Manage your movie budget. Do you want a big name director? Star power in your casting? How much CGI in your special effects? Are you going to pay for original writing or turn a quick buck on a popular re-hash re-make. My first introduction to this theme in gaming. Making movies, who doesn't love movies? Can't believe this is an overlooked genre.

Every Knizia auction game has been a hit with me and this is no exception.  It is not easy to get what you want, and the gameplay is brilliant.  I would love to make up a custom version of the game someday, with names & pictures.

I enjoy the game. It's hard to get a feel for how many contracts to pay for each star for the different number of players. Sometimes really crappy sets go for amazing amounts of money for the first film or best film of a round boosts. The end game bonuses really make a huge difference, keep an eye on them!! Sometimes people get caught up trying for the worst film when you could get more points having the best green (or something similar)

Overall it's a nice game that plays fairly quickly.

I'm a cinemaphile, and this is still one of my least favorite auction games ever.

I should be able to put my finger on why that is, but that would necessitate my playing this game again - which I absolutely don't want to do.  How's that for moronic paradox.

Played 10+ times (with 3 to 5 players, mainly 4). Probably my favourite (almost) pure auction game, for some reason I am not sure I get. It might be the redistribution of winning bids. The theme (even though I have not seen half of the movies) probably helps a bit too.

Knizia game, check.  Top 100, check.  Auction game, check.  Great theme, check.  I was completely prepared to fall in love with this one and then something happened...I actually got to play the game.  The auction mechanic was nothing special.  I never felt any real tension and the whole game just sort of plodded along.  Maybe the theme is doing a lot for other people, but I just didn't care about it enough to make me change my opinion on the game itself.  Maybe I'm missing something, but if ever someone was predisposed to like something, it was me prior to playing this.

RATING: 9
Great bidding/auction game with zero sum money in play -- winning bid payments get paid out to the other players. Felt a bit cramped with very few elements available to fulfill movies, so luck of the draw (especially for the party spaces) could really impact your ability to be competitive and complete a few films. A bit of "surging" in the games where a large bid may keep you out out of a few rounds as your resources are now in the hands of the other players, so you really, really need to time your moves well. Still, an interesting bidding system which I enjoy far more than Ra or Medici. FAR PREFER TRAUMFABRIK version over the Hollywood Blockbuster version - that's the only version I'm interested in via trade.

I'm just not a big fan of auction games, especially if it is the only driving mechanic.  Traumfabrik has a great theme, but all it comes down to is upbidding others while holding onto your contracts so you can spend big on the sets that really matters.  Quick, harmless but rather boring.  Personally I'd prefer Showmanager over this any day.

Lovely theme, great zero-sum bidding game.  Don't let anybody tell you that actors are the only way to win; I won my first game by one point and I had the least number of actors on the table.  I like that you can see what's coming up in future auctions.

Nothing great here, but nothing bad either.  This is basically a pure auction game with some unusual mechanics for wealth distribution.  Clearly this game was made before the developer started cranking out as many games as he could create as it has a little something going for it.

Game could easily become "dated" as the entirety is basically one big inside joke using things like "Steven Spellman" as directors and the like.  Not that this would detract from the game, but part of the value is the humor which would grow stale with age.

After 10+ Plays: I love the closed economy, the balance between completing films early and making them the best, the competition for actor tiles for first choice in the parties, and the theme and graphics (only in the original German version).  I think this one is really at its best with 5, and I don't think it works well at all with 3.

04/20/06 - Rating 6 (after 2 plays):  This game is a whole lot of saying the following:  "I bid this".  You will hear this same exact phrase about 140 times during any given game of Traumfabrik.  There are much more compelling auction games available, and the theme doesn't save it because a) the game is in German, and b) the theme is too abstract to get into the movie feel of the game.  I love you Reiner, but not for Traumfabrik.

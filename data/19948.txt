- Very simplistic; Won't scratch that strategic itch for most the time.


Why it's previously-owned:
Way too fiddly and long for what is a very elementary game.
This got donated to the local high school game club where a few members seemed to enjoy it.

I played this because a friend made me.  Yes, he's still my friend.  There was rum involved.  I was told this would enhance gameplay.  It made it survivable.  I won't play this again.  Unless there's rum - then all bets are off.

Quick, fun, a good dose of luck but not so much that good play doesn't overwhelm it -- a nice themey pirate game.  Under-rated, I think.  Well, the ship wrangling takes forever and seems like a giant waste when playing with two...

Surprisingly low luck:  I've yet to win a game, after five or six, and my wife's margins are huge.  It's actually very much about probabilistic efficiency, while having buckets o' dice.


Hey!  I won one.  Almost.  Well, she won on rum tiebreaker.  Next game I got clobbered -- the old "no coins" trap.

RATING: 7
A wonderfully silly but enjoyable pirate game. Use your pirates to collect things round the town, scoring points and then one huge punchup to decide who gets the beds. Not for the serious gamer as luck plays a huge part in the game. Definately good for dragging out every pirate impression and cliche.

In spite of the fact that it's called RUM and Pirates, this is truly the ultimate beer and pretzels game: a lot of fun, but one major luck fest. Very well themed (in a fantasy pirate sort of way...although, at times, it felt like playing Bang), with the exception of the graphics on the board: I thought the board had a sci-fi look to it. Space pirates, perhaps? I think this would be a great game for the under 12 y.o. set.

{4 plays, 3-5 players} More fun than good, I think I like it best with 5 (and am curious about the 2-player game).  Yeah, another player can just hand someone a sweet set-up, but for some reason, it doesn't bother me as much here.  Maybe because I like all the bits and the various things you can do.  I can see us all getting tired of this one down the line... maybe.  It's light, fluffy fun with cool pieces.  How can you not enjoy that?

*** UPDATE - May 2007 ***

Wow, what was I thinking "best with 5"?  NEVER play this wonderful game with five.  Never.  Well, unless all five players are Rum & Pirates veterans who know what they're getting into.  But do NOT teach new players this game with the full five.  The downtime will kill it for them.  That said, I'm still liking this one a year later.  And yeah, there's a *lot* of die rolling... and I don't care.

RATING: 7
This game is a lot of fun, actually! Everyone around the table shouting out the scorpion tallies, inviting people to the pub for drinking contests, just generally laughing and having a good time. I like this game, not least because of that enjoyment factor. It's a very light game with a lot of die rolling, but there's nothing wrong with that as long as everyone's into it!

One of the odd ducks in the Alea big box series.  Game play is very light.  Strategy is questionable.  Fun is moderate.  Production is well done though.  At times, you may find the play less well thought out than the component holders.  If you are expecting a deep game, look elsewhere in the series.  If you want some light pirate fun, this might work.  Might work better when you provide your own rum too.

First Game: 6-11-07
Leah and I played it for the very first time with Taylor and Justin, which taught us the game.  It is a pretty interesting game.  It is nice and simple but with quite a few things to think about.  It is one of those games that you gotta watch where you place the captain so that player to your left will not benefit from it.  There is quite a bit of luck with the treasure as you can lose points for no fault of your own.  I got 5 of 7 scorpions this game and none of them I took the treasure.  That was 10 points lost from just poor luck.  Also with 4 players the game certainly overstays its welcome.  I think this would play a lot better when played with only 2-3 players as you can do a bit more planning because you can kind of predict where your opponents will go. I will certainly give it another try if played with 2 or 3 players to see if it is a better experience.

R&P is definitely not a bad game, but I think it's:

Enjoyable, but light area control/set collection/dice rolling hybrid sort of game. I enjoy this game quite a bit. I think the components are top notch (love the counter tray) and the multiple paths to VPs make for an interesting game as well. The only negative I have with the game is the luck factor seems to determine the winner in every game. Still fun though.

Great game for the kids. Lots of chrome, fantastic theme but with some tactical and strategic play as well as luck. Everyone gets the chance to fight the city guard, find treasure maps, go to the pub or rendevous with their 'pirate bride' (yeah, bride for a night, fixed prices). 

This one keeps growing on me and the artwork helps, who know that pirates slept under blankets with a shark design, or on pillows with pictures of turtles?

RATING: 7
A tatical game of garnering up points and working to leave the others in a position to not be able to.  It has luck of die and chaos (I would imagine with more players).  There is more going on than I expected.  Yes, there are dice but like other Feld games (Burgandy) you can acquire ways to mitigate those rolls.  The board is variable to push the game in different directions. I enjoyed this much more than I expeted with the reviews.

This game is VERY Feld-like.  Especially playing other games of his, you can see it.  

So, more than meets the eye, you can be creative and fly by the seat of your pants, timing is big.  I expect my rating to go up.  I definatly want to play this again.

Even as a beer and pretzels game Rum and Pirates fails.  The game is just too long with a depressing lack of anything resembling an interesting decision or even that elusive "fun factor" that can sometimes redeem a game.  Dry as your average Euro without any of those delicious decisions that keep us coming back to the genre.

RATING: 5
Your pirates roam the streets of Tortuga (or whereever) in their never-ending search for a good, piratey time. This involves "findin'" gold, treasure, rum, and swashbuckling paraphenalia; pressin' new mates into yer hearty crew; mixin' it up with the night watches; arrangin' a rendezvous with yer sweetheart; drinkin' the other waisters under the table; and then wrangling with 'em for the choices spots on the ship to sleep it off. Doing all these things earns you points. Being a bit lucky in where you are when your turn comes around and in throwing dice when required earns you considerably more points. While perhaps forgetable for more serious gamers, there is still plenty of fun-- and a reasonable balance of luck and skill-- for casual gamers and social gatherings, too. (And if pirate games are your bag, bump the rating up a point or two.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Lots of luck with a fair number of ways to mitigate luck.  It's wise to get extra pirates from the unemployment office early in the game (more pirates = more turns = more points earned).  Hard to tell who is the leader since there are lots of -2 scorpion chips that get distributed.  Rulebook is a bit lengthy, but once you know how to play, it's pretty easy & straight-forward.  This is mainly a game of tactics, but it is nothing special.

Yuck, didn't like this at all. Where to start? Theme - appears to have lots of this, hooks, parrots, eye patches etc, but it's all very superficial, you're just moving around collecting stuff, no real 'pirate' feel at all. Game play, tedious and luck driven - if this game ran about 20 minutes then it would be bearable, but 5 rounds ... and the 'combat' mechanic of die rolling is pretty bad too, can take ages I'd have preferred a mechanic where one roll resolves it. All in all it wasn't fun ...

We played now the 5 rounds of Rum & Ehre combined with 5 rounds of Buccaneer ship-card game(from S.Dorra) as an expansion. Works well as an thematic add-on for a day phase of the game. We start with the city phase and the hunt for the tiles at evening. 
Then they go for the best places to sleep and when your crew have slept well, they sail for plunder the Merchantman, galleons and fleute´s at sea. In one round at sea all players have to plunder the 3 ships. For forther interest, see my explanation at Buccaneer.

Rating based on one play (4-player).  Cute enough, and has more meaningful decisions than apparent at first glance, but didn't quite gell for me.

In a 5 player game, the margin between first and last place was easily the result of one die roll during the game. Why waste 90 minutes when one roll can determine the winner?

Feld has some excellent games like In the Year of the Dragon, Macao and The Name of the Rose. I guess "Sh't Happens" even to great authors.

6/7/06 - if you were expecting a deep strategic game because this comes from Alea then you might be disappointed. However, to me, this is a lot of fun. Admittedly though, you may be faced with very little or no choice when it is your turn - but this happens infrequently and not enough to spoil anything for me. And the die does not have a huge impact on anything - if you are a terrible roller then grab some rum to mitigate your awful rolling. I'm glad to own this game.

Amusing little pirate romp through a town.  I like the many different ways of earning victory points and the strategy around moving the captain to benefit yourself without leaving a "gift" for your left-hand neighbor.  It is easy enough that it should be fun with older kids too.

This was very well-received at game night in a 5-player game. Definitely a keeper. Along with Roma, these early lighter Feld designs are great "gateway" games for mixed crowds. They also stand up well with more experienced gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
UPDATE: Rum & Pirates has held up well to repeat play (I'm up to ~5 plays), and I've always enjoyed it. Definitely play 4 rounds instead of the alotted 5 though with more than 3 players; it seems cutting one round doesn't have much unbalancing impact on the game, and 5 rounds is definitely too long.  Unless you become a Rum & Pirates fanatic, it's unlikely anyone will ever gain enough experience with the game to make 5 rounds play quickly enough to not feel too long. Rum & Pirates will never be a regular, but I think it'll enjoy its spot in my collection for some time to come.
---
Call it an 8 for a high fun factor with the right folks for a couple games, but probably not quite a long-term keeper, so ding it to a 7 for replayability. It's a light game, but it's in a nice spot in that it's chaotic and you get to roll dice in fun ways, but each turn you feel like you are making real decisions with meaningful implications. There are some nice choices on the risks, and the game is quite flavorful. Seems like a good one for mixed company (adults and older kids), which is a category that is often a problem, so that's nice. Still, significantly the lightest of the alea big-box stuff, and many BGGers will be lukewarm. One non-trivial downside is that unfortunately, the game isn't scaled terribly well. The 5-player version unquestionably takes too long (the no-brainer answer seems like it is to play ony 4 rounds with 5). The game wants to be 60-75 minutes or so. There might also be a slight disconnect in that it perhaps encourages a little bit too much analysis for people prone to that sort of thing. Another issue is replayability. I think most light-hearted gamers will get a kick out of it for a few games, but I see it having a hard time hitting the table after that.

This is another interesting candidate for using a d7 to replace the d6.

While there's not a heck of a lot of strategy here, it's still quite a bit of fun!  The fights for sleeping places, rolling to avoid the scorpion treasures, and vying for drinks at the pub were all fun game elements.  The game weight makes it very suitable for families, and overall is a light, fun game that I'd highly suggest if I was in the mood for such a game.

Fun game = definitely not to be taken seriously.  Likely would be a good game to play with non-gamers.  Easy to explain and play.  Though it is light it is good for a light game because there are decisions to make and it feels like your decisions have consequences.

There are not many games that you know you like after just one play. But rum and pirates is so much fun I would gladly play it at anytime. You can beat up the local guards, recruit more pirates to your crew, find treasure maps, have secret rendevous, chill out in the taverns, earn some gold or rum and then wrangle for the best places to sleep on the boat. And when your go is done shout Avast so the next player knows you have finished. Brilliant. 10 Plays.

Tried this one today.  The rules are not bad at all, but the rulebook is looong, and very unnecessarily so.  Once you learn the thing, the rules aren't bad and it doesn't take long to play and it's reasonably fun.  It's definitely in the light and pleasant category, so very atypical for Alea.  You roam around the board with pirates and land on spaces that allow you to get or try to get points.  A fair amount of dice rolling, but a perfectly pleasant short game.  Nothing stellar.

This is an experience game with some gamer type decisions thrown in. If that doesn't sound like something that you would enjoy, then there is no need to try the game out. If you're looking for a somewhat gamey pirate themed title, and don't mind significant luck, then this is a good choice though.

In this game players are a gang of pirates, following the leader around to various spots in town. Most of the spots on the board generate victory points in different ways including collecting map pieces, collecting pirate gear (i.e.: eye patches), collecting treasure, collecting...experiences with the local ladies, and my personal favourite, winning drinking contests. Most of these things are simple "spend your guy, take the chit" moves, but there are significant random elements involved in the chits you pull. There are also contests that are strictly dice driven such as the drinking contests, and the end of round fight over prime sleeping spots on the ship.

I liked this game, but do not walk into it expecting a heavy game. It's not, it's a very well-themed game with a lot of random elements. This game does have interesting decisions though, and it is gamey enough to be inaccessible to the extreme casual set, at least that would be my conjecture. I like this sort of thing every so often though, and I quite enjoyed it. By far the best pirate game I have played.

Dice, miniatures and a counter tray. Everything a grognard wants!

RATING: 7
Fun victory point collection game. The game comes with some nice plastic pirate figures, a modular game board, and tons of victory point chits. There are a lot of ways to get points in this one, so the the avenues to victory or not very limited. It has the randomness of a die that may turn people off (not me). While the theme is pretty pasted on, it does seem to lend itself to pirates carousing.

An issue I do have is with the length of the game. It just seems to go on for a turn or so too long.

The game came with a really nice and well designed rack to hold all of the counters. I wish more games would come with things like this.

A couple plays now and I really liked this. I really like the tension of doing "more stuff" verses being faced with running out of pirates for the battle on the ship, and having to head to the ship earlier rather than later, which is a tie-losing situation for the battle for the sleeping quarters. I really like the battle. Yes, it's a dice fest. But unlike such things as Pirate's Cove, it's simple and straight forward, and does a really nice job of not deviating too far from expectations going into it. And everyone has full control over their pirate strength and position going into that battle. It's just fun.

Played once to great success.  My initial thought was that the going drinking portion of the game was a hoot, but generally speaking it felt like a bunch of mini-games stuck together, a la Nintendo Mario Bros. style.  Still, I think about this game every now and again.  I'd like to play again, so that's got to be a sign of something good, huh?  Bought this to add to my Alea big box collection.

Components: The tile case is awesome, keeping everything snuggly in place between games. The pirate pawns are great as well. There are so many tiles, we had to be patient in trying to identify them correctly. I love the randomly-generated town map.

Experience: More fun and strategic than I thought it would be. There are so many great choices in which direction to take the captain in town, and whether to pay for an extra turn and/or passage through a dark alley. The various intersection types all seem desirable at different points, and their perceived value fluctuates. Money is very important, especially to ensure I can participate in pub crawls.

The wrangle is hugely cumbersome, and not very interesting. Next time, we'll probably just throw all the ship pirates into a bag, and draw out the winner (we can spend our barrels to redraw, maybe). It's a lot of dice rolling for just a very few points.

Lighter than one might expect from Alea, but still good fun.  You have to decide how you're going to earn your points, given the changing landscape and the varying costs (path lengths to your next scoring opportunity).  You also need to consider how the die is going to bounce.

Okay - after one (two player) play, so take this rating with a view towards future revision of opinion... I know that popular opinion has already deemed this as an "unworthy Alea" game. While this may be true - Rum and Pirates is certainly not a game to be mentioned in the same breath as Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence or Louis XIV, Rum and Pirates is not a bad game. I found that it worked fairly well as a two player game, though I can see that the clutter of pieces on the board would certainly be more interesting with larger numbers of players. Despite the large number of die rolls, it is possible to devise strategy, plan ahead and reap benefits from your opponent's position.

Again - I suspect that my feelings about the game may change with repeated play, but right now, I am happy with the game and look forward to trying it again.

I enjoy some dice-rolling but the whole 'bedwrangling' mechanic just dragged on. 

We were laughing about it and there was some excitement... but it's not a game I'd want to play again for a few years.

The bed-wrangling bit kinda feels like War probably does(the largely deterministic card game, which I've never actually played).

Wonderfully themed, interesting resource management game thoroughly pervaded by randomness. Players use their main resource (pirates) to get some new resources (money, which allow for some nifty tricks, and rum, which allows some rerolls) and victory points. Each of the five turns is divided in two parts: one which is based on tactical placement of the pirates (movement of the captain), one one strongly based on dice rolls. 

Materials are quite good, and the game qualifies for a funny ultra-light gamer's game. (?)

RATING: 6
Players represent a Pirate crew in port, lurching around town picking up pirate points.  At the end of the turn (day), they head back to the ship to sleep it off.  Players take turns to move the pirate captain piece around the board, representing a map of a town.  The town is divided into alleys and intersections, and moving the captain means filling the trail behind him with your limited supply of pirate influence.  Reaching an intersection allows you to take the associated action there - gain equipment, money, die re-rolls, etc.  At the end of the day, when players choose or must pass, they head back to the ship for a die roll contest for the best sleeping position.  It's all about picking up points as efficiently as possible, and while some will howl that this is a Alea game, it's actually pretty good!  Don't expect Ra or Puerto Rico, and you may like this.  Felt a little long, but should speed up.

There's a bit of fun to be had here and some clever set collection elements. However the overwrought "wrangle" mechanic just takes too long for what it accomplishes and causes me to lower my score by a point. 

The same wrangle mechanic is also semi-broken, imo, as it actually encourages players to wait until the last minute to place pirates on the boat. Since later players win tied rolls, there isn't much reason to go on to the boat until after the other players. This certainly changes the strategy, and not necessarily in a good way. I have to wonder if the rules are not in error regarding this point - rolling for wrangles should start at the *bottom* rather than the top, and proceed upwards. Alternatively, start from the top (as printed) but award ties to the first player to roll. Thus a roll of 6 becomes unbeatable, giving players a very real incentive (a 1 in 6 automatic win) to go for the boat first. Maybe I'm just totally missing something regarding the wrangle...

I'd have preferred player screens to the flag tiles, as fitting your loot under the tiles gets fiddly.

One final minor gripe is that the loot tiles themselves get fiddly - especially because you have to randomize and draw from so many different piles.  Cards would have been much better.

Overall, I enjoy this one despite my minor gripes. The theme and artwork are a perfect fit for the game. The gameplay is fairly light and fun, and the game ends just before wearing out its welcome.

Played my first game of Rum & Pirates. It was an OK game. Something I would play again, but probably won't buy.

*UPDATE*

I played a couple more times. Rating went up. It's better than I first thought. It's a non-gamers game. Anybody can play Rum & Pirate. I even bought a copy. Go figure.

Rum & Pirate is quite enjoyable. Most important I think in Rum & Pirate is to get extra man early on to go longer in the later rounds of the game. I love the pub fighting especially when there are 3 or 4 of the same color at the same time. Tough luck if you got no money to join in when it happens.

*UPDATE*
Played a lot in a short period of time. Did an over dose of Rum & Pirates. Don`t won`t to play it again any time soon. 

SOLD MY COPY.

I'm not sure why people don't enjoy this game. Maybe if it wasn't in the Alea line and people didn't have expectations of a strategist's game, it would be regarded for what it is - a family game that is themed on pirates. No, it doesn't cover the usual pirate themes of sailing, pludering and pillaging, but to me that's a positive. I modify the rules somewhat so that each player gets one gold stipend every turn. That gets more people deciding whether or not to play more pirates or go for the best hammock. It also allows for more use of secret passages.

Played 1 time (5 players). As the 'teacher' set the game up, I was already rather unimpressed by the general presentation: cheap board tiles, muddy indistinct artwork, and the feeling this game would be derivative and simplistic. Sadly, there were no surprises that evening. On your turn move the Captain pirate to a new intersection and claim prize tile the intersection depicts. Tiles are either point chips, or special ability chips. The one interesting part of the game was deciding how many pirates to save to send to the ship and to try and send them at an opportune time to maximze your odds of winning...well, more point chips. The pirates go to the ship and then we have an interesting, but not all that inspiriing dice roll-off, at the end of which some players get more point chips. I am not saying there are some tactics here, but there are just so manny better games these days. Too random, simple, and long for gamers, too convoluted for casual gamers.

Light tactical game that has more thought than initially perceived but also offers up a lot of risk for reward situations.  Rum & Pirates' main decisions come from the movement of the captain - where to go, how to block?  Anyone hating the luck of a dice roll will without doubt turn away from this game, and miss out on the fun.  The modular board, plus the player interaction make this have more replayablility than most have suggested.  A wonderful game.

I've bumped this up to an "8" after about 5 plays.  It is quite fun!!!  I find this game similar to "Hansa" in several ways:  (1) All players use the same game piece on the main board; (2) on your turn, you move the main piece from where the last player left it; (3) the reward at each destination is randomly introduced but is know before you go there (4) you must manage the number of spaces that you move the shared game-piece based on the amount of resources you have in hand.  However, the game adds a luck element (for at least two of the rewards random tile draws or  die rolls determine the degree of benefit) and also 5 rounds of play that are separated by a "intermission" activity that gives the game some rhythm and variety.  It's a light, fun game.  Nice theme.  It has a generous dollop of luck and a bit of strategy.   A great gateway game.

With Rum and Pirates and Winds of Plunder both arriving in 2006, we now finally have our first two good pirate-themed games (with apologies the excellent but very un-pirate-y feeling Cartagena and the reasonably good but equally un-pirate-y Corsari).  Rum & Pirates hasn't been getting the best reviews, probably because of its unexpectedly light feel and the very prominent role of the treacherous dice.  This is leaning heavily toward the family game category, but it's probably a bit overwrought for that style of game, making it a better choice as a light and atmospheric game for gamers.  There's no actual piracy in this game, but it does create a vivid feeling of pirate recreation at a seedy Carribean port town.  It's very high on the luck-o-meter, but there's a lot of opportunity for smart tactical play, and the game more often than not gives you something to ponder.  If you demand a game in which good play guarantees a good chance to win, this is probably not the game for you.  I strongly recommend adding some extra dice to the box so that each player has his/her own.  I also recommend restricting the game to 2-4 players.

This is a great game with 1 big flaw. The components are excellent and most of the mechanics are great. You leave trails of plastic pirates all accross town as you find maps and drink rum and lots of other very thematic actions.

There is one mechanic I don't like and that is that you can send pirates to the "ship" to find a sleeping spot. You then line up all the pirates from the 2 or 3 people that put pieces in and have them roll against each other and then move to the other side of the mast then back again. Lots of individual roll-offs really slow this game down and don't add much to the experience in my opinion. I might put in a house rule that whoever has the most pirates in the match wins the best bunk etc. and forget all the rolling and re-rolling, although that makes rum useless I guess. 
I will probably just trade this away and not play it anymore despite it otherwise being one of my favorites of the Alea line.
I consider this an ALMOST-HIT, or a NEAR-MISS ...something like that.

Two plays with four, two with five. Some might find it too long or too rules heavy considering that it's a light game with a fair amount of randomness, but I've actually had a good deal of fun with this one. Good for gamers who like a little more luck and theme than your standard euro. The only problem with it is it goes on a little long considering how light it is, but that's easily fixed by reducing the number of rounds from five to four.

Gdy po długich rejsach i grabieży pirat wraca do swojej tajnej bazy aby odpocząć i się trochę rozerwać, można zadać sobie pytanie. Czego potrzebuje pirat? Przepaski na oko, drewnianej nogi, haka zamiast ręki, kapelusza czy papugi nie ma problemu w grze to jest a dokładnie płytki z tymi akcesoriami które można zakupić na polu ze sklepem dla piratów. Pieniędzy oczywiście można je dostać na specjalnych polach z pieniędzmi. Pirat kocha skrzynie ze skarbami nie ma sprawy są też skrzynie a nawet skrzynie ze skorpionami które mogą dotkliwie pokąsać (zabierając punkty zwycięstwa). A może pojedyneczk z grupą strażników proszę bardzo i to do wyboru czy to będzie duża grupa strażników (i dużo punktów) czy też mała (mało punktów i pieniążek). Włócząc się po mieście można też zbierać mapy skarbów. A co robi pirat pod koniec dnia a no oczywiście idzie do baru i nawet zaprasza innych piratów (i to nic, że muszą mu oni za to zapłacić po monecie). A gdy dzień się kończy piraci wszczynają awanturę o miejsce do spania a jest o co walczyć bo spać można w wygodniutkim śpiworze, mniej wygodnym hamaku lun na masie z lin. 
 Teraz należy się czytelnikowi małe wyjaśnienie powyższy opis dotyczy bardziej klimatu gry ale klimatu opartego na mechanice. Gra jest tak naprawdę eurogrą ze sporą dawka losowości wynikającą z rzutów kostką ale jest to euro z prawdziwym klimatem . Tutaj czuje się prawdziwych piratów. Dodając do tego bardzo klimatyczne figurki piratów wykorzystywane w dość ciekawej mechanice ruchu oraz modułową planszę składającą się z 9 kwadratowych płytek które można ze sobą zestawiać w sposób dowolny w kwadrat o wymiarach 3x3, dostajemy bardzo fajną i wciągającą grę. Jest to gra stosunkowo prosta ale i tak zmusza do myślenia. Więc jeśli ktoś nie jest śmiertelnie uczulony na losowość to gorąco polecam.
 Muszę też dodać, że gra bardzo dobrze działa na 2 osoby (grywamy z córką i jest świetnie).

I would try this again.  It's a very lucky game, but there are some really nice parts about it as well.  I think the way you move a shared "captain" piece around is a very cool way to divy up action points amongst players, and make certain choices present themselves at random costs.

My beef is that there is a lot going on that makes the main mechanic I like and want to try and optimize matters as much as rolling lucky, or hoping that the guy to your right doesn't just run you into some very crappy choices.

First played this on Feb 6th 2007.  With all the pieces and length of the rules, it seems like a complicated game, however it's not really.  Most actions are simple to do, just need a lot of explaination.  After a game you should have a pretty good idea of how to play.  It's all about victory points and how to get them faster than everyone else.  I'd play this again, however there are other games that I'm interested in right now.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game, but it requires just enough brain-stretching.

Don't play it if you are in a mood for something complex and truly demanding, but rather when you look for something of moderate length, on the lighter side and with some randomness added.

Decent game - and charming for many ;)

EDIT: After several plays I'm satiated.  And my tolerance level for lighter games is lower now...

Wow, this has to be the simplest and lamest Alea game to date. It's not terrible but it pales in comparison to the majority of other Alea big box games and is slightly worse than Mammoth Hunters and 5th Av.

Rum & Pirates could be a decent filler game, but it goes on way too long for a game that can turn on random rolls of the dice or the whims of other players. It is certainly my least favorite Stefan Feld design of the ones that I've encountered.

I think I'm biased against the pirate theme because I've played so many bad pirate games, but it's hard to tell which is the chicken and which is the egg here.  (Or maybe it's because the Johnny Depp-inspired fetishizing of pirates makes me a little ill, since I don't care to see murderers and rapists glorified in Disney movies.  And yes, I know the authorities they fought against were no better.)  

I'm just not interested in any of the decisions in this game, and probably won't ever play again.  I can forgive this game since Feld also gave us Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon.

Played a couple of times now... a very nice addition to the alea big box set of games.  Not too difficult, but not that easy either.

Lots of interesting choices each and every turn, with just the right amount of luck to keep everyone in the game until the very end.

The last game five player game we played was decided by only 5 points separating high and low score... you can't get much closer!

This could well become one of my favourite alea titles.

Good game.  Has some strategy involved in where you want the captin to go to get the best points out of a tile.  The wrangling for sleeping position is a little fiddly but plays out ok.  If you don't mind a game that is dice driven with some decision making involved as well then this is a game for you.

RATING: 5
A light game where you send pirates around the board to pick up victory points. Some are just gained while others require dice rolls or having a certain number of your pirates remaining. There is definitely enough dice rolling that I think the person who rolls better will win.

The pirate pieces are nice.

It's a light game with less strategy than most, but it's a fun light game. Plays a little long for a filler, but that's easily enough remedied by just reducing the number of rounds.

RATING: 7
It's a light, breezy game with a healthy dose of luck, but your decisions are meaningful.  I never felt that the random-luck elements reduce you to the roll of a spectator as it does in some games that are out there.  As a light game, this game begs to be played in an hour or less, which after my one play, I think it usually should.  If games started lasting much more than that, I think my rating would drop significantly.

又名海盜逛大街，是個充滿歡樂及機運的骰子桌遊，個人覺得算是富有代入感的家庭遊戲，遊戲以加勒比海海盜為背景。玩家扮演著回到岸上休息的海盜，隨著船長在港口的大街小巷閒逛。玩家驅使船長穿梭於小巷，四處打鬥、豪飲，收集蘭姆酒及名聲。每天完結前，玩家還要回到海盜船上爭奪床位以求舒適的一晚。

RATING: 6
Plays a bit like "Wildlife Adventure for Juniors".  As in WA/Expedition, players are extending the end of an existing path to get to key locations on the board.  But in R&P, there's only one expedition, and no secret locations.  Instead, players just get to point-scoring places.  The scoring itself is straightforward to the point of mundane.  Still, it can absolutely be a good family game, and a good rum & pretzels game.

All the problems with this game have already been articulated.  Why was this released under the Alea brand instead of Ravensburger, where it more clearly belongs?

The game itself is kind of fun, but too rules-intensive given how much of the game rides on dice rolling.

Nice insert for the chits though.

RATING: 6
An extremely luck-heavy pirate game. Its certainly very thematic, reminiscent of Monkey Island (someone else mentioned that) and its fun as a no-brainer dicefest. The problem is that there's no way to win unless you're lucky (be it tile-drawing or dice rolling). Some challenges (like the scorpion) were great for getting everyone involved, others (rendevouz & pirate shop) didn't work so well. 

Wrangling is a slow painful process that doesn't make any sense. It took up too much time, and everyone grew bored with it.

Components must be mentioned. Superb plastic holder for the tiles (even with a cover to stop the pieces from shifting around). Cardboard was a little thin, but the plastic pirates were nice. I wished they had included a player aid even though the rules were quite simple.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are some good ideas here - managing your pirate group and the trade-off with the bunks at the end of the day. Some of the mechanics strike me as strange though. I don't understand the purpose of the dice roll to 20 or so - that could have been done in a more strategically interesting way (I guess some people might like the nearly chance lottery element - it doesn't do anything for me). I have never really been into pirate themes so that doesn't help for me either.

First play of this game proved to be quite entertaining, although doing so on Halloween with our FLGS owner wearing a pirate hat prolly didn't hurt.  While certainly not a brainburner, the action is quick enough, and the decisions are difficult enough to make this game hit the table regularly.  I had read many comment that were lukewarm on this game, I can only assume they disliked the randomness of the dice.  If you like games with elements of luck, instead of logic puzzles masquerading as games, I think you will enjoy this game quite a bit.

First played at Jenn's house fall '07

A lot of luck in this game, supposedly offset by the hidden victory points, but I think that adds to the luck/surprise factor at the end, when the winner is discovered and no one really knew they were winning.  I like seeing the stream of pirates though that show where the captain was moved to each round.

Excellent lightweight game with numerous ways to obtain victory points. Simple well thought out movement system with a few twists to keep every game interesting.

I don't know why but there is something fascinating about this game. Still, it's not perfect, it need a few rule adjustment. The first thing is that you always lack of money so getting 2 gold when starting a new round should be interesting. The bedroll fight takes too much time and are just too much random. By the way, the pirate placement mechanic is really nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game was surprisingly good and definitely underrated.  It's fun and has a little strategy.  It's sort of like a Mario Party game in that it has a lot of fun little "mini games" and things to work for.  You also get all kinds of piratey things like a peg leg or a parrot.

The ship part of the game is really annoying, if that part weren't in the game it would be much better.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels like a lengthy lightweight game, and usually that's not a great combo.  I was surprised this was a big box Alea game b/c it's on the lower end of the complexity scale.  There are lots of ways to score so that might add to the learning curve which makes it longer.  Not difficult, just slightly lengthy.  It especially helps cut down on game time if all players have their own personal six-sided die to roll (instead of sharing just one) because this speeds up the game greatly.  If this game was an hour long, it would be perfect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The second play grew on me.  I find the pirate movement mechanic quite interesting in what is otherwise a relatively simple set collection game.  

FIRST IMPRESSION: Definitely the easiest game of all the Alea series, its not a bad game if played quickly.  Still, it will never be a classic nor one I will seek to play often.

There's Rum, there's Pirates, there's a crapload of dice rolling. Some of the mechanics are interesting like the pubs where you opt in to take a chance of a payout.

Plastic minis in an Alea game? This is definitely no Puerto Rice or Princes of Florence, but as a Pirate-themed family game, it's quite good.

This means that even though there's quite a bit of luck involved, there are still plenty of interesting decisions to be made to keep a gamer happy.

Fun little game for sure.  I only played it once with 2 players.  The whole end-round thing with a dummy player is a tad convoluted with 2 players, but still fun.  The game kind of feels like you're at a carnival going from attraction to attraction.  Different spots offer different benefits, some of which are like little mini-games.  Like having little dice roll-offs to see who gets the points, or stuck with the negative points, or choosing a tile to draw hoping you have more men than the number on the tile.  Anyway, pretty fun.

Interesting take on the light-weight genre by Alea, both atypical for the line and very different from the approaches other publishers (e.g. HiG) took in the past. While Thurn und Taxis for example tries to retain a fairly complex system with a minimal ruleset, everything in here is rather straightfoward, even a bit simplistic (the movement, the handling of the luck factor etc.), though the game has twelve pages of rules. For example, if you are rolling _the_ die (just one), you're always just trying to roll higher than the previous player. That's it. No hidden complexity, no tactical masquerade (cum grano salis).

Not sure what to make of it at this point. But, hey, how many german games come with a counter tray (that even has a lid)? That's just cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A Feld game that deserves more recognition than it receives. It's nothing earth-shattering, but I also don't think it should be swept under the rug. "Quaint" would be a good word to describe it. One that you can pull off the shelf throughout the years and have a nice time playing. I think the problem a lot of people will make with this game is to either overestimate it or underestimate it. Approach it like a classic card game. If you don't apply any brain-power to it, you'll feel like nothing is in your control, and if you apply too much, the game won't give you much in return. The sweet spot would be a "medium-level" of brain power where you think about your turn for maybe 20 or so seconds. There are a few cool moves you can pull off if you're paying attention. My big tip for the whole "sleep wrangling" part of the game would be: Have one player know exactly how the "sleep wrangling" aspect works. It has a good idea behind it, but it's pretty clunky. So having everyone just follow along with one player narrating helps speed things up.

Game in a Nutshell: Lead your Captain around to different areas in order to gain cardboard tokens that score you points in different way.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: Some really quality bits, especially the pirate figures and tile organizer. The actual gameplay is very simple to explain and shouldn't take too long to get going and teach along the way.

Cons: The game boils down to a simple tactical abstract with some straight forward "let's see who can roll the highest number" dice roll-offs and turns it into a game that at half the length would be too long for what it is. One simple player aid or quick-reference would have helped newbies with all the symbols. 

Other: I don't believe I got the best explanation of the game before my one play. It took me the whole game just to remember what symbols meant what. That said, even the best explanation probably wouldn't have changed the fact that this just isn't that good.

Best Use: Really, just cannibalize the pirate dudes to flesh out a cooler game.

Kind of feels like the family version of Trajan. It also gave me a similar feel to Five Tribes with moving the pirate captain around, even though it isn't similar at all. I didn't feel like this did anything Trajan didn't already do in a better way, so I ended up getting rid of it. If you want a family-friendly Feld game though, this is probably your best option. It's simple enough that most people can play and enjoy it, but still has some interesting decisions.

Surprisingly random for an Alea.  I'm sure there are important decisions to be made here, but overall it feels like an odd abstract resource game with a very tacked on pirate theme and good dose of dice.

Bumped up to a seven.  Still undecided on if I like it going five rounds - four rounds feels a bit better.

No one would ever mistake this for Feld's best. Quite different from the brand everyone today's crazy about, but perhaps this title helped him develop his ideas, particularly around innovations of dice. As it stands, there isn't enough in this game to recommend it for the table; the trope of using a die to determine the outcome of a conflict comes across as an especially tired one.

You need to move the captain around the city to pick up items to score victory points. There are many different ways to get points, but some will be better at different times. A fun, light semi-abstract game.

Like Hansa, your game is pretty much driven by where the person before you left you and what's feasibly economic to pick up. Turns here at least are quick although the choices aren't that hard or interesting. There's fun in the fluffy dice-off's and the luck in the pick-ups. There's way too much fluff to sustain the idea over multiple rounds and then into repeat plays, but it's some decent fun for the occasional pullout for variety - although the difficulty in re-remembering how all the different types of scores work tends to then limit how often it comes out. But when played, enjoyed in an Africa type of way.

haha! Now is this a fun game or what? That's what pirates do! They go around, drink a lot in bars, they grab some gold, befriend new sinister fellas, find coins on the street, buy themselves shiny new hooks or wooden legs and after a hard day of pirateering they slap one another in the faces for the best sleeping spots on their ship!!

Fun indeed! Unusually light-hearted for a Alea game but nevertheless an excellent addition to every collection!

Only one complaint! The colours! There's some seriously bad colour selection...

An instant hit with every type of board gamer!
- Easy to teach and easy to learn. Plays fairly quickly and is fun till the end!

A gift from my good friend Jason.  Thanks, Dub!  This game has the distinct honor of being the first Stefan Feld game in my collection.

An underrated Feld game for sure!  This is a great game!  It's lighter than many of his games, and yes, it uses a die that brings luck into the game.  And it's still great!  I really enjoy making the decision as to which intersection to move the pirate captain to.  The specific actions of each intersection type are very different and all play out in a fun way.  Many paths to victory.  Pick a strategy (or don't) and have fun collecting all those wonderful tokens!

RATING: 6
Even though this is far lighter than the other games in the Alea series, I still enjoyed it.  It's a mesh of interesting mechanics, but overall is pretty light and has a lot of luck.  There's also a (very) limited amount of hosing that can be done, and there is a LOT of dice rolling.  (Most fun, though, are the treasure rolls.) It's fun, but it's not strategic on the level of Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, Ra, Taj Mahal, or Traders of Genoa.  It also takes about a half-hour too long, and can drag a bit.  Rating based on one play.

On a marketing note, this one refuses to fit a niche.  It's not really all that strategic, making it an easy "meh" for gamers, but, what's worse, it isn't easily grasp-able by the Yahtzee! and Monopoly crowd, as the mix of cleverness and variable ideas, though simple to a gamer, are far from intuitive.

Silly euro with some light play. It seems that when given any option to take an extra pirate it would be very silly not to take it when in the earlier game. A lead on pirates will certainly give a large advantage. In a two player game moving from the outside of the board seems totally unnecessary. Seems the kind of game that works better with more players.

This is a super light route building game, where players get cute little pirate meeples that they lay down behind the path of the red action pawn that players move around the board to collect tiles of different point values when they land on an intersection space. A few of the tile collection methods require die rolls, which feels a little uncomfortable among the other mechanisms in the game. Still, the game is pretty fun for what it is, however I don't think I need to own this.

This is based on only a few plays, but I think this will be most fun when players want to sit around saying, "Argh!" and, "Avast there, me matey!"  If that mood is there, this game should suit it admirably.  It's light and plays quickly.  The wrangling for a bed is a little fiddly and occasionally when rolling for a high VP tavern, the game can get a little tedious.  The components are top notch, especially the chit tray with a snap on lid!

Surprisingly fiddly for a such a simple game.  And the tile used to "hide" your points is way too small.  At the end of the game it's balancing precariously on top of a pile of chits.

The dice are used brilliantly to add chaotic bluster to what would have otherwise been a very dry game.  

One game I played I and another player had 4 pirates in the wrangle, the other 2 players only had one, yet I was the first player eliminated.  And I wasn't even the first player to put my pirates in the ship!  In some games this would have been disappointing.  But in Rum and Pirates, it's fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much better than expected! It's a roll-and-move game without using dice to move, but it has dice anyway!

Your typical roll-and-move game (on a board with branching paths) involves moving from one location to another (which location depends on circumstance or strategy). However, many times, you end up landing on a space that allows you to do nothing.

Not so with Rum & Pirates; you always get to do something -- you always land on an interesting space. Even if you can't move because you're blocked off, there's still something to do (contribute your leftover movement points -- in the form of pirates -- to an end-of-the-round fight for points).

Second thing going for this is the variety of things you can do. Your typical roll-and-move game only offers drawing from an event deck of cards. Here, many events involve playing stupid luck-fest games with a single die.

That said, it is a total luck fest of a game. Interesting tactical options, but I'm afraid that those would get stale after repeated plays. It's a kind of game that keeps you busy, but not mentally.

It needs a little bit more "cuthroat" action such as rolling to win the pubs (the best bit) rather than just jumping on spaces and collecting chits. Very light and it seems out of place in the Alea series. Good diversion and some simple, tactical decisions makes it a fairly fun kids game, but there's going to be a lot of collectors looking to continue with their sequence of Alea games who will be totally underwhelmed by this. 

I've had a game in which the other three players refused to keep playing after one turn, while we ripped through a second game with another group featuring loads of laughs and taunting. But I still got bored before it finished.

One good mechanic, and the rest is a tedious dice-fest. The good mechanic is placing your pirates in the streets of the town to lead the captain to the place you want to visit (the action you want to take). For everything else, you roll dice.

Unique mechanics. Players deploy their pirate band along routes in a town, visiting various locations to collect tiles, money, maps, rum, treasure, etc. (all ultimately leading to VPs). Not as light as it may seem on first glance, as the are plenty of difficult decisions and tradeoffs to be made, including where to lead your band (considering the next player will start where you end up), when to push your luck (with dice and in brawls), when to pay for an extra move, when to send your remaining pirates to bed for extra points, etc. Alea big box family.

Not a bad game. Nothing breathtaking in complexity. Different strategies to gain points. A kind of Tower mechanic from Trader of Genoa for movement. And of course, it is actually fun and not taxing on the brain.  I can see why it is not considered the best of Alea bigbox series, but for what it is it is fun. Takes about an hour, slightly more with beginners. Easy to teach. Lots of rolling dice to throw random in at every try, but because of this, and the way it is done (humorous usually), it is fun to play. If you are looking for the next Puerto Rico, try elesewhere. This game is less about the depth, and more about the fun. Though some unique mechanics are in the game, they do not hold the game together compared to the jovial attitudes when playing. Played with 2 and 5, worked best with 5, but do-able as 2; still the same fun in either mode. You are never out of the running it seems. Scores are tight.

There are a lot of fun elements to this tactical game.   It tends to be impossible to keep track of you opponent's scores, so it becomes easy to just concentrate on good decisions during your turn.

Derrière un énième jeu de pirates (Um Ruhm & Ehre est sorti en plein milieu d'une grande mode sur ce thème) se cache en fait une sorte de compilation de jeux de dés... On place des pirates dans les rues, et à chaque carrefour se cache un petit jeu de dés généralement plutôt rigolo, et ce jusqu'à la grande baston finale, toujours résolue aux dés.

À force de lancers, la chance a tendance à s'équilibrer au cours de la partie, et on obtient un petit jeu sympathique. Malheureusement, les règles sont du coup assez longues : il faut décrire chaque petit jeu de dés, ce qui lui empêche de se voir appliquer un label « familial » qui sied d'ailleurs assez peu à Alea.

Un jeu au cul entre deux chaises, qui du coup se retrouve avec une note entre deux chaises...

I enjoy the ride. The game plays with very little downtime and keeps you occupied. Visiting the pub and having the other players hand you money seems to be the key here. Less money for them and more for you means more choice. Combine it with adding to your stock of pirates at the beginning of the game and you should be in a strong position. It's a fun ride and the die rolls being plentiful it all evens out in the end - which is how a dice rolling game should be. Quite fun. As a new game with inexperienced players it runs a tad too long, but it rates a seven if playing only four rounds where we can get it to under an hour. Holds a strong place in my collection as a closer or near closer where you don't want to think too much.

Lightish family game about on par with Ra or Adel Verpflichtet as far as weight and strategy goes. Reasonably luck dependent but lots of opportunity for making smart decisions and probability. Because there can be multiple options on any given movement, the game so far has taken a bit longer to play than it feels like it should (mild AP, though now that the group is familiar with the game, this is less of an issue.) Overall I like this game, it's mechanics are novel and unique (to me) and good for all ages. Plus you can break out all your pirate jokes, quotes and voices when you play. As long as you aren't expecting Taj Mahal/Puerto Rico/PoF you will probaby enjoy it. Oh it has the 'best bits container evar!" A die for each player helps speed things up a little...just be mindful of those with rerolls.

Ignore the "Alea" and the size of the box or you will be underwhelmed - this game shouldn't really be grouped in the same 'collection' as Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico. Having said that, Rum and Pirates is a fun little romp through a pirate town, and to be fair to Alea, they do rate it a 2/10 for complexity. You can plan ahead a small amount, but you're basically reacting to what your opponent has done or rolling dice (which can be controlled somewhat by rum!). If you get into the piratey theme you can really enjoy yourself. Just don't expect a gamers game!

RATING: 4.5
Got it to complete the Alea large bookcase series! RGG english edition. The game is a light fluffy affair: players move a string of pirates (from their supply) across paths on the 9 mapboards. Special squares activate different actions (money, wares, missions, treasure maps, etc) and the end of each round is marked with a huge dice battle for sleeping spaces on the ship. After 5 rounds, the pirate who has collected the most 'honour' points wins.

Rules are simple, the components are the usual Alea quality (passable but not great). The tile holder is a brilliant conception though. Points for that. If only more games had a similar way of organising counters.

Update: Sure, there are laughs to be had but the game, as a beer and pretzels affair, outlasts its welcome. There are wild swings with the die rolling and it just gets tedious after awhile. The 'wrangling' is a load of nonsense and this is a blemish on the somewhat outstanding Alea bookcase series. It's better suited as a Ravensburger box (Think San Marco). Disappointing.

RATING: 2
Without a doubt this has the coolest inserts in any game I've played.  I mean talk about functional.  It seperates and displays, pulling it off in such tight quarters.  Quite impressive, the insert even comes with its own lid.  How cool is that?

Oh and those Plastic Figs of Tom Selleck in a pirate outfit, wow!

Ok, that's about the best that I can come up with that is positive about this game.  

When people were knocking this game, I felt I'd try to give it a chance and make up my own mind.  Here is a case where I should have actually listened to people that I trust.  I put off buying this hoping to find a good deal, and it turns out that no deal was good enough.  When I started reading through the rules I kept asking myself if I was reading them correctly, the game felt totally arbitrary.  I like risk management games, and this was Alea's take on it so I just expected this to be balanced and put aside all assumptions  (even from my initial disappointment) to give this a real go.  I love experience games, and I love designs that focus on theme, but I didn't find either here, just random points.  I knew this was going to be random, but I at least thought this would be fun.  I'm just not seeing what other people are in this. As I said, it is Alea, I don't always enjoy their games, but I certainly hadn't played one that I didn't respect.  That has certainly changed now.

I don't mind random games if they are silly light and quick.  I don't mind chaotic games if they are lively and interactive.  What I have no tolerance for are chaos heavy games thrown wild by a ton of random elements spread out overly long and drudgingly plodding.  Unlike Hansa, where much of the intriguing part of the game lies in where you leave the other players to do the least amount of damage, this game only offers options to score some points for yourself and a ton for other players, or do nothing worthwhile with your turn, all this fencing is thrown out the window as the point swing on some of the draws are so dramatically different that there is no sense in trying to actually make any real "decisions".  If people hate the newbie giving points to others in Puerto Rico, this game will drive those same people over their boiling point.  Money is so tight in this game that you often don't have any real options to move anyway.

Then there is the ever irritating Wrangling phase.  Could anyone have found a way to make this any longer, more tedious and less enjoyable? I think the answer would be no.  Especially considering how the prize for winning is petty compared to what can be picked up randomly or at least arbitrarily on the board.

It seems that the risk reward for the spaces just don't make sense to me.  The all or nothing aspect of some of these spaces remind me of how irritated I was with instant death holes in Super Mario Brothers.  I wanted that Pacman dying sound to go off when you draw two hook tiles, or loosing to an army, or missing the pub sign rolls.  If you love losing your turn this game is for you!  Cue the Trombones! Waaa-waaa-waaa-waaa-a-a-a-a-ah

All this would be passable if it were only two rounds, but five rounds of this crap is asking too much from people.  Who is this game for?  Too many rules for families, and nothing here for gamers.  

Stefan Feld is batting zero for two with me.  I just don't understand why Alea published this?

RATING: 6
The rules take a LONG time to go through - there are many different icons to learn - but it's really a pretty straightforward game.

The board shows a map of town with streets of various lengths connecting intersections marked with icons. A captain token starts on the board and will be moved from turn to turn. The game has 5 rounds. Each round players take turns until everyone has passed. On your turn, you have 3 options:
- Pass (costs 1 gold)
- Move captain (C). Players move C from intersection to intersection by placing their tokens on each step of the street between intersections. C can also be moved off board via an alley (costs 1 gold if there were other routes open) and back onto the board via another alley. The icon at the intersection denotes a specific type of event (e.g., get a gold, get part of a treasure map, etc.) ... many ways to earn VP.
- Place all their remaining tokens onto the ship (ending participation this round) to fight for bed space (3 tokens worth VP)
After your action, you may take extra actions (1 gold/action).

After all players are done, there is a fight for bed space amongst all players with tokens on the ship. This, and many of the intersection spaces, is resolved by dice-rolling; lots of dice rolling! Rum barrels, obtained at certain intersections, can be turned in to earn up to 2 re-rolls.

At the end of the round, pass the starting player token and repeat. At the end of 5 rounds, whoever has the most VP wins!

It's actually not a bad game. It's on the light side of things, but it plays reasonably quickly and there is definitely some tactical play going on. Rating could go up a bit....

Far too fiddly for such a light game.  Everyone kept asking what certain spaces mean, not a good sign for a simple game with so much luck.  As a result, you have a game that's kind of fun but won't have much appeal for hardcore gamers and is too complicated for casuals.  Blimey!

Absolutely funny and cleverly designed game! It feels like a family game (which, in fact it could be), but it doesn't mean it is bad game. It incorporates a lot of interesting concepts like pirate chains and clever end of turn system. Use of the dice is not making the game more random than a deck of cards or other randomized tokens. Some mechanics could be a bit better developed but I'm aware that it could make too rigid. Strongly recommended for playing with kids.

Much better than the lengthy rules would suggest.  The tile tray is a fantastic player aid but the game should have also included screens to conceal each player's chits.  Yes there is a lot of dice-rolling but getting the most pirates onto the ship after everyone else has boarded (and hoarding a few barrels of rum) goes a long way in overcoming a bad roll.

Another excellent game from Alea.  There is a bunch of dice-rolling in this one, but it seems to work out pretty well.  It adds some strategy to the "going to bed" phase, some tension to the scorpion, and plenty of humor.  The choices on where to go, conserving pirates, and considering what the players after you need make for a fun game.

A somewhat light-weight family game that will turn off some hard-core gamers, especially those with expectations of something meatier, as is usually the case in the Alea line. The choices often are a only a shade away from being overly obvious, but the game is fun. There are a ton of bonus chips (some 200 or so), which is inherently a bit fiddly, but the games comes with a nice device for sorting them. The game is a bit too lengthy, perhaps, but the good outweighs the bad here.

I have seen comments that it is to game-y for non-gamers, but not game-y enough for gamers.

I am a gamer and have now played this with casual gamers and kids (9 years old).  I disagree that it is too game-y for non-gamers.  I find that the game is just right as a gateway/kids game. 

While it is not a gamers game, it has enough interesting decisions to keep a gamer involved. 

So I think this is a great gateway game as it has enough luck to keep everyone involved, but the game does reward good decisions.

The game scales well from 2-5, suitable for a wide range of ages and anyone from kids to geeks can enjoy it.

My biggest complaint is that it may need to be shortened by a round or two as it does drag a little if you do not play quickly.  The upside is that this is easy to do without adversly affecting the game in the least. 

Bottom line:  This game is a bit fiddly and luck dependent, but it is definitely fun.

Update:  Rating goes down from 7 to 6.5.  I keep finding myself avoiding this because of the long playtime and long setup time.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

Surprised how much I enjoyed this.  Could be because I wasn't expecting much, but it seemed to have all of the flavors of games I really enjoy.  Group think, playing off of the players, relative values.  There are so many random factors it almost has to balance themselves out by the end of the game.  I hope  I get to play this enough to solidify my ranking, but I have a hunch this will wallow in unplayed land based off lukewarm reception by others playing.  Time will tell.  The left/right binding does seem a bit extreme in this game.  I think it would have gone over better if it was not part of the esteemed big box alea line.  It does not fit into that line, but it seems to be quite a solid game.  With the vapor trails left by the captain, it seems Rudiger Dorn may have designed it.  Thats not the case, however.

Rum & Pirates barely exceeded my rather low expectations. It’s number 10 in the Alea big box series, completing the trilogy of widely panned Alea big box games (i.e., Mammoth Hunters, Fifth Avenue, Rum & Pirates), which came between the more widely praised Puerto Rico (#7) and Notre Dame (#11) on either end of this trilogy. Rum & Pirates (known in German as Um Ru(h)m und Ehre, which I gather is a pun on the word honor or some such thing) is a fairly simple game of using your limited supply of pirate figures to move the captain figure around the board to reach various places that give you the chance to score a few victory points. The downfall is the complication that comes from having countless different types of places to score victory points in myriad different ways, but all of the ways are effectively the same in that they simply involve rolling dice against your opponents. There are pubs and supply tables and treasure maps and such, but whether you move the captain to one or the other, in the end you’ll simply be rolling dice to try to take chits worth a few victory points. I suppose most board games could be boiled down to sound this inane, but Rum & Pirates felt particularly aimless. The additional downside of the game is that you play five independent rounds that don’t build on each other and simply serve to add artificial length to the game. This is similar to the repetitive rounds of Powerboats that simply make the game take more time without creating any sort of arc to the game play. There’s no Act 3 climax or Act 5 denouement to speak of, there’s simply Act 1, then reset, then Act 1 again, ad nauseam.

RATING: 7
(1 play) A *lot* of dice-rolling and luck on tile-drawing. But, it's a better game than that probably makes you think it is. There is enough randomness that I think the luck will balance out fairly well more often than not, and there are plenty of choices, both tactical and strategic, for players to take calculated risks with. I do wish they had streamlined the rolling a bit -- there are a lot of cases where player A rolls, then player B rolls, then compare, because of the way the reroll rules work. 

I can definitely see having fun with this with non-gamers. For best use each player should probably have a small box to roll his die in (I can't believe they only supplied one! Even though strictly speaking that's all you need, passing the die around the table would get really unwieldy), because there's plenty of stuff to knock over.  More likely to drop on replay than go up unless my impressions about the choices hold up.

[thing=19948][/thing] is a light game in which players spend their pirates in order to got to places and do actions, and offers plenty of dice rolls to go along. It has a high tactical factor and impact of luck built in, but did give some control over to the players, as some actions are resolved without dice, and those that are, give a little edge for those that first go there. [thing=19948][/thing] was made this way in order to make it work both for more serious gamers as well as for family nights with the kids.

[thing=19948][/thing] isn't all that easy to explain, due to the several different effects of locations, however, once learned, the pace of it is quick, with fast resolution of most turns, except for a few that may demand a number of die rolls. Only the last phase of each round, when the players fight for the best beds in the ship, can take a little longer, but it still isn't long, as there is no tie (but there can be some re-rolls).

It has some progression, with the possible increasing of pirates, romances and treasure maps. There is good level of replay value due to the random set up of the island tiles, and also because of the random nature of the tokens draw.

Overall, [thing=19948][/thing] isn't a great game and sure won't please everyone, mostly due to the amount of luck it carries, however, it is efficient in what it purposes to be: a light entertainment, but still giving decisions to be made by the players.

I am surprised there are not more comments on the length of this game... We played a five player game with a regular Gaming group, and it nearly took 4 hours.  With a box time of 60-75 minutes.  Not sure that is possible in any since of the word, unless you are really experienced, paying no attention to strategic initiatives..  etc. etc.  Lots of Luck with Dice Rolling and random draws, Rum Helps to re-roll, but still Luck is relevant.  Although not boring, and fun, it is a bit repetitive, and if players are not invested, could really drag.  Anyway,  Good for the Alea collection, looks cool during play, and does follow the theme.  

With all of this said, if I am investing 4 hours into a game, it will be something else.

The theme is of course very good, but the colors of the pirates are quite confusing, some colors are very close to each other. Also the treasure maps have very close colors in them. Lots of cardboard chips in a container, which is not simpliest one to use with big fingers.

Hm.  There's a good bit in this game that is against it, right off the bat, for me.  I'm not wild about games that are designed to be played in a way so as to keep the player to your left from being set up for a great move; I don't like games that leave a lot each turn up to the roll of the die; and I don't like games with good plans that can be spoiled by someone else choosing to break the normal rules.  I have to credit the designer with attempting to include some mechanisms to alleviate some of that chaos and randomness, but it's not enough for me.

I've only just realized this is a Feld game, and it has Pirates.  Double bonus.  Saw this at Essen in 06 when it first came out and only gave it cursory attention.  Finally picked up a copy and hope to get more play in with it to discover his hidden subtleties.

This is a fun game, a bit luck driven (dice driven ;)) but fun!!

I really enjoyed this one.  It's definitely more of a family game than a "gamer's game."  There is a lot of dice rolling, so there is a fair amount of luck.  However, the strategy shines through the luck.

I'm pretty sure that this one will get a lot of playing time over the years.

Hey - even my daughter likes it, so it will hit the table again.

Lots of different scoring options. There is luck when you have to roll the die (which is NOT the main mechanic), but the rum barrels help out in this case. Maybe not what the internet community expects from a big box Alea, but I don't care. It's a fun family game that can be enjoyed by gamers. I like the game.

Movement and collection for rum and renown amongst fellow freebooters along the modular back alley streets of the pirate village. Drinking, gambling, wenching and fighting for a good spot to sleep it off.  Luck of the dice and tactical positioning around the communally moved captain pawn.  A light hearted and lightish game especially for Mr. Feld.

Played this twice in one night but really didn't feel the urge again. This is more of a family style game but then it has some complex bits like the bunking rules that make it fiddly.

in some ways this reminds me of Merchants of Venus and all those movement dice.  But whereas in MoV the gameplay evolves through various phases (as the board is explored and the goods cup worked) in this game those elements are lacking. Still a good game as it's not like your usual fare.

Played at a convention and every single aspect of it I disliked.  Uninteresting mechanics, trite theme and generally insipid gameplay

I have been enjoying rum & pirates a whole lot.  It is simple to grasp, but gives enough choices to make you feel involved.  Most people I introduce it to enjoy it and are willing to play more than once.

Good fun but you need a full compliment of players to make it shine.  Easy to teach - concept should be easily picked up by casual gamers or non gamers... good for small party.

wacky set-collection from Feld using pirate figures to create routes to different kinds of scoring tiles... then you have an attritional dice fight over the end of round scoring tiles... the tiles all have different set collection rules and functions... fun!

Interesting little game. I like this game. I don't get to play it as much as I have in the past.

RATING: 6.5
A rather entertaining light-hearted title with a neat board movement that's actually filled with meaningful decisions.  Rum & Pirates is really just a collection game with lots of randomness thrown in, which I don't necessarily mind here.  Don't take it too seriously and I think you should be able to discover a charming thing or two.

After 1 Play: If a game is going to be silly and fun, it should be simple enough to jump right into.  If its going to have lots of little fiddly rules and pieces, there better be enough strategy to justify them.  This game is very light, and yet has so many rules you can't just sit back and enjoy the ride.  In addition the art is garish and unappealing, which was really a surprise coming from an Alea game.

This one is a rather light & fun game. Sadly the rules are a bit too much to explain before the game starts (compared to it's depth). Another draw-back is the repeating rounds. Nothing changes and you do the same stuff over and over again without a change of pace or a change of the tension...
Anyway, overall an enjoyable light game.

12/19/07 - First impression not stellar.  Certainly not bad, but I don't recall feeling like it really mattered too much what I chose to do on my turn.  We'll see what comes of our next game...  ......

141217 Cute speed game, works fairly well 2P, especially with my variant where both players have the top card visible along with a middle card.  Whoever blurts out the symbol between their own card and the middle card, and the symbol between the opponent's card and the middle card, gets the symbol.

Absolutely manic and hilarious matching game. Every card has a number of shapes, words and objects on them and each and every card have only ONE symbol in common - sometimes the images are different sizes which will make you scream out occasionally after staring at your card for nearly one earth minute "There is no bloody way these cards have ANYTHING the same!!!!". Simple but genius.

It sounds easy to spot two similar shapes on two cards, but actually the game is harder than you think. On some occasions it can take several seconds which feels like an eternity in this game.

To be honest, this game does not offer any greater depth or meaningful decisions. It is just a simple test of speed. But it is fun and the game allows for several different play modes which adds some artificial variety to the game.

This is essentially Catch the Match. Sure there are several different ways to play but they are essentially all the same. But this is a fun exercise and I could easily see playing this (or Catch the Match) with a table full of people. One advantage over Catch the Match is that there are 50+ cards instead of the few that are in Catch the Match. I used to rate this as a [Children's Game] but changed that since the game works just as well and in the same circumstances with adults as with kids. It's fast and fun.

I don't typically like speed games, and most of the proposed ways of playing Spot It are definitely speed games.  Yet, I found it to be a lot of fun particularly with kids.  There's just something about the human mind at any age that can struggle to locate the matches on these cards.  The design of the cards is brilliant in the way they move around, and re-size the different images in order to throw you off.  I got more enjoyment out of playing this silly little game than I have had with some of the most highly-lauded designer games.  If you have any kids, getting them a copy of Spot It is a no-brainer, and they even have themed copies now so you can get one that will interest your family.

It’s difficult to think a better party game than Dobble/Spot It, whose every feature perfectly fits the role: it’s easy to teach and understand, it’s quick to play and it’s full of variants slightly changing its gameplay, thus suiting every taste. Moreover, it’s easily transportable, since its tin box is compact and resistent enough to be put everywhere without breaking.

Outside parties Dobble can still be enjoyable but doesn’t shine as much.

Es un microjuego tipo party-game. Me recuerda mucho al jungle, pero sin violencia. Es un conjunto de cartas en cada una de las cuales hay una colección de símbolos. Cada carta tiene un símbolo en común con el resto. Admite 5 modalidades de juego. 
Solo he probado una en la que tienes que conseguir el mayor número de cartas. Cada jugador comienza con una carta y se van desvelando el resto del mazo. En cuanto un jugador pronuncia el nombre del símbolo que tiene en común la carta desvelada y la superior de su mazo, se adjudica la carta. Rápido y divertido. Reflejos.

It cost a bit more to purchase the NHL variant, but the only problem with a theme-based variant is that it may exclude participants unfamiliar with the iconography.

Super silly, I love games like this where it is your powers of observation that levels the playing field, like in Dutch Blitz or even in Go.

Very quick easy family game. Anyone can play: from kids to grown ups. No need deep strategy, not even tactical, you need good reflexes. Perfect for picnics! Short sessions, lots of laugh. If you allergic to stressful games, and have bad reflexes, this won't be for you but otherwise...! Also no text so you can play with people from different countries (although you might ask what a いるか is the first time someone shouts that while playing their card). Could get repetitive but so fun you can play over and over again.

Nice and versatile card game of reflexes and quickness. Very good packaging, with the small metal box which you can bring around. Very BAD idea of proposing round cards: you can't sleeve them and, due to the kind of game, they can get damaged easily. A little bit overpriced.

I can't really say that it is a game that I would want to play all the time - hence the six rating - but it is a really fun and clever little game that almost anyone can play and will enjoy. I think I probably would rather play Set, but that's probably just because K totally hammered me five times in row.

This game will always have a special place in my heart just because of the way I was introduced to it.

PAX Prime 2013: the convention is officially over, and it's nearing midnight in the Sheraton hotel bar. Three of us are sitting around, well onto our fifth drinks, playing Galaxy Trucker (or... trying to. Not a smart move.) An Enforcer comes up to us as we're finishing up and asks "Hey, want to play a game?" We played a whole bunch of games in a row while continuing to drink. Then we played more games with our new friend. One of the best con experiences I've had to date!

Anyway, Spot It! is surprisingly fun. It's quick and simple, has that "OH GOD MY BRAIN WHY IS THIS SO HARD" feeling Anomia also gives off, and there's like five ways to play. I dig it. I got the Halloween version because Halloween.

PS: Play while drunk. Trust me on this.

Going on "game time vs fun had" this game is the best game in the world. 

Doesn't matter if you are any age, any preference, "more into Euros" or what have you, with this game and about 5 minutes you will laugh more than you will in most of your other 2 hour games.

Simple and fantastic.

I have gone through 3 packs of this already as I keep giving it to non-gamers who like it so much want to own a copy and don't know where to buy it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Components: Round is good, and I like that there is no top/bottom/left/right to these cards, which makes them very friendly toward all players around the table. The cards could be of better quality, but even if they get marked, it won't matter too much, because it would be too difficult to remember all the symbols on the marked card.

The symbols are great. A real fun variety of colors and complex shapes. With familiar and less familiar symbols intermingled, and even some words, it really jumbles the brain. The orientation and size of the symbols makes it difficult to spot even the most obvious of them.

What a fascinating math problem to make any pair only share one symbol!

Experience: Super fast and fun. This takes a game like Blink or Jungle Speed and cranks it up to 11 on the madness dial. It's so difficult to quickly filter through all the symbols, and then, even when I've found the symbol, to switch gears and actually think of the word to describe it.

We've played three of the four different games included. They are all similar, but definitely get more difficult (corresponding to their numeric rank). The Tower is the easiest, with only two cards up at once. In The Well I'm still only looking at two cards, but if my opponent finds the match, they add their card (that they've already been staring at) to the center. In the Poisoned Gift, I'm looking at multiple cards, and trying to nail whichever player has the fewest.

I had minimal expectations for this game when it was unwrapped at Christmas. But boy was I then surprised as to what terrific family fun it produced.  A game lasts 3 minutes and it had all 6 of us (me, my Wife, and our four teenage kids) shouting for more.  It is a very straightforward and manic game of pattern, or image, recognition.  So simple, so effective.  Mini-game 5 was the best, where you put cards onto the fellow players' stacks. Hilarious. All 6 of us really enjoyed ourselves.   What more can you ask for from a £10 tin of cards.

Snap. Basically it's snap. But not so easy. I was told (and can imagine) it works great with ages 4-90!

Match one of your symbols on your card, to one of the symbols on the other card (with about 10 symbols I think) so 20 symbols looking for the match, then saying it and putting your card down in time, before someone else!

Easy. Yet fun.

[6 plays] This was just a surprisingly fun little game. It's a visual-recognition speed game mainly, but without the maiming element of Jungle Speed. The game includes instructions for several different variant games you can play with the Spot It! cards.

Played it 20+ times.
For 2-8 players it's a 7 as a filler game.
For 14+ players it's a 9.

Great filler game for people who can think quickly and have good hand-eye coordination.

I'm a youth pastor and I use Spot it for groups of 14+.
I have it like a tournament.

Everyone picks of a spot it card and then they pair up.
When I say "Go", everyone flips their card over and they yell out their matching item, then sit down.
Last pair to find their matching item and sit down loses.
Last pair of winners wins game.

Another way to play is:
Everyone pairs up, but this time they are competing vs their partner.
First person to shout out the item advances.
Last person standing wins.

These games are fun for everyone.

I played a demo version of this at tabletop day and my daughter (8) really enjoyed it so I picked up a copy.

Interesting and fun matching game that is quick to play, looking forward to bringing this to the next games day.

Really enjoying what could effectively be called dobble-tourettes as the group I play this with are generally so quick that each match is generally followed by lots of swearing and cards flung across the table. 

Really Really good fun and several simple variants in the tin although Hot potato has to be my favorite.

I'm not so sure all the various themed versions deserve to exist (though the plastified beach version might just be an exception), but the basic game is a fantastic implementation of the mechanism. Anyone can learn it, nearly everyone can play it, it's pocket-sized, and it's a great game with kids. Indeed, for the kind of game it is, it's close to gaming perfection: tiny, has zero setup time depending on the variant you play, you can easily handicap it for different ages or ability, and even if you lose cards or they become marked, the game continues to function. It's like the cockroach of gaming (and I mean that in the best way possible), it's everywhere and never dies!
So: It's not my favorite _kind_ of game, but it goes with us on every vacation and has come out pretty much everywhere. Oh, and I gave our copy away and had to buy it again, so much everyone we've ever shown it to loves to play it.

I didn't record my initial impress of this game from Aug 2013, and only rated it a 5. And, honestly, I don't even remember playing it in August!

Just played it today with 4 players, played three variations, and enjoyed all of them. Cards are poor quality and will bend all too easily, but the central game idea (shared among the 6 rulesets), is simple, and quite fun.

Gave to Dana.

 As the instructions say, a light, mini-party game.  A recognition speed game that is surprisingly more difficult (at times) than I expected.  I mean, how hard can it be to pick out two objects identical in color & shape, with perhaps size being the only difference?  

Small & compact, fun.  good travel game.  4 variations.

Because our gaming group is getting so big, always pleased to find games that play more people--this plays up to 8, and only lasts 5 mins, so as games finish we can keep adding people in until we have enough to re-divide & start some "real" games. starts.  Besides, party games give a nice break in between high intensity games.

We found that 8 people sitting around one small little card was a little difficult to see. The table had to be pretty big and that made the card in the middle, rather distant.  Also, the more playing, the more "ties" happen, and if you are in a competitive group, the more unpleasant it becomes.

Take a jungle speed type game, remove the potential for injury, have the matching aspects a little more thinky, and It's a nice little family game.  Just amazing that you can set it up so there is only one match between any two cards, and the fact it can sometimes take you so long to find it - a solid 7 rating (Feb 2014).

Great game that is truly all ages. Teens will always win, but my daughter who's 4 years old gives us a run for our money, too. The trick here is that any two cards in the deck will only ever have 1 symbol in common. Take turns revealing a card and finding the symbol that matches your face up card. There are a few variants included in the box (tin?) in case that gets boring. Recommended!

First played July 6th, 2014.  Takes just a few minutes to play and it's more about visualation of the ~20 objects on the card and spotting one in the center.  Great game for the youngsters to play.  Ages I played with were 4, 7 & 10.

A speed reaction game, but a well-done one at that. Easy enough for young ones to play (ours 5 and 7). The only drawback for the youngest is that sometimes you have to match a word instead of picture. There is also a junior version with pictures only.

The game includes 5 variants, all of which have a different feel to them even though the basic mechanic of matching runs through all of them.

Lots of fun, plays quickly (of course) and the whole family can compete on the same level.

Fun visual perception game.  Nice for parties or as a filler.
Thumbs up for 5 modes of the game described in the rules.  Maybe 1 of them is weaker, but the rest plays very good.

The problem is that the game loses its fun appeal too quickly and burns out.
For that reason I prefer 'Geistesblitz' in this category.

Spot it! isn't a perfect filler game. It doesn't have a ton of depth and, no matter how it's played, has some rough design choices (tie resolution, seeing symbol previously called out on the next disc).

What is does do well is be extremely accessible. It takes less than a minute to explain how to play and easily entertain for quite a while. It also features many variants (and possibilities for coming up with one's own rules). This makes Spot it! an excellent choice for non-gamers and a decent choice for those looking for a quick and easy game to play.

I love Spot It! (see comments on the other edition), and this edition look gorgeous. It’s also a lot harder to play with the Signature edition, because it has a lot of words and no colors. I love it! 

I like the game a lot, the only thing that stop me from getting it, are that I can’t sleeve the cards. 

I won’t say ever no to this game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2013)

What a surprise. This is a great game, very easy to teach and quick to play. I love reaction games and I have bought two different editions of this game. The problem I see, is that it is impossible to get sleeves for the circular cards :(. I realize I’m very anal about my games :D and that’s the reason I will probably sell/gift it.

The game components are adequate, the art is ok, but the gameplay is GREAT. I love it. 

I really like this game and I will try to play it often at the end of our gaming sessions. It is perfect to introduce new gamers to our hobby.

It appears I’m not the only one anal about his games, in an entertainment fair (SOFA) here in my city (Bogotá) I saw some people playing Spot It! with laminated cards! I think I will do the same thing :D. I have sold all my Spot It! copies because I could not stand to play it without sleeves, but now I have a solution so I think I will buy it again. 

Also I just found it is available for the iPad so I will try that version too.

One of 2009´s favorites.

This was one of the first modern party games I discovered. It was fun at the time. All the cards have one picture in common, and you have to spot it as fast as possible. Now I've discovered other, more complex games, I'd only play this with really young kids.

Another portable game. Can be played with a table. Works with kids and adults, although for adults it may be better as a drinking game or a game to play while waiting in a long queue. The metal tin doesn't fit so well in a pocket but I prefer the circular cards to normal cards.

When I played the original Dobble I was intrigued.  I thought it was a cute idea, but nothing big.

When I broke out Spot It! with my family, everyone instantly took to it and almost instantly understood how to play.  Whenever we play the kids want to keep going.  Even our almost-3-year-old can play, and can sometimes beat the adults!

Any game that can bring together the family so quickly, so easily and with so much fun has to be an instant 9. 

The different variants are all pretty fun, I think my favorite is the Poisoned Well.

Jedna z pierwszych gier, jakie wpadły do naszej kolekcji. Na początku używana zdecydowanie częściej niż teraz. Bardzo dobra gra imprezowa, ale równie dobrze sprawdza się w pojedynkach 1 na 1. Są momenty, kiedy można przysiąc, że na kartach nic się nie powtarza ;). Kilka wariantów rozgrywki znacznie urozmaica czas spędzany z grą.

Én elsősorban gyerekeknek ajánlanám ezt a játékot. Persze felnőttként is lehet benne kihívás, főleg ha egy gyors partnerrel játszik az ember, de alapvetően kisebbeknek való szórakozás. Ezen a téren viszont kiváló! Ebben a játékban is a figyelem és a gyorsaság számít, így nagyon különböző képességű játékosoknak frusztráló lehet az egymás elleni játék.
Felnőtteknek maximum 5 perces móka az egész.

It's another speed recognition game and it is pretty well done. I played the first two variations and the second one is my favourite now.
It's a bit pricey for what you get but this will be a hit with kids.
I got the regular edition and I sincerely hope the cards are more durable in the kids version because they were very thin.
And they are round so I don't even know if it is possible to sleeve them.

I wasn't too impressed by the statement that exactly one item matches of a card matches  with exactly one other item on any card. But seeing it in action itis pretty impressive allthough it is basic math.

this is way overpriced for a cardgame but the game is just fun to play

Speed recognition that's good for mixed ages. Spot It is interesting for the way everyone has a match.

I bumped my rating up a point for the variants. My kids enjoy the one where you look for a trio out of nine cards. Some of the other variants tend to advantage the last player making a match.

This is a game for children.  But it is a perfect game for children, thus earning 10 stars from me.  Grown ups can play and have some quick fun, kids get better with practice (which can also be a good quiet activity to go through the deck themselves).  It is completely portable in both it's size and the space needed to play.  Often pull it out at a restaurant while waiting for food.  All families should have it as back-up, emergency fun.

A great family piece and good for young and old. Its a okay filler, and can run multiple games in a series. Does get kinda stale after lots of plays. a new group of people to play it with usually re-energizes it though.

A simple yet fun family game. It's portable enough to bring for dinner, and simple enough for the whole family to play. My 6 year old has no problem keeping up with the rest of the family.

The idea is to find one item that matches any two cards. There are lots of different ways to play, including poison pill and hot potato. However the mechanism is always the same. It's very quick to learn, so much so that you don't even need a full practice round. 

Honestly the worst part about this game is to keep the kids yelling when they get excited playing it, esp. in a restaurant.

Watched Tom Vasel's review of this game, and wanted it straight away.  Seems like a game I can teach my students learning English easily.  It's taken me 3 months to finally hunt down a copy. 
Update: Finally got around to playing it and it was a LOT of fun.  Lots of interaction and talking.  Great for teaching English.  Wanting to get another set...in case I outplay this set.  I can see myself playing this game maybe 5 times a week at school.

Played it once during my very first month playing non-monopoly style board games. Have always enjoyed the "find difference" pictures and the speed element is fun with the right crowd. As time goes, I now prefer fillers that have some decision making in it. Though this is still a good party filler game if speed game is your kinda thing.

Very simple, unassuming little game.  I immediately looked at this as just another kids game, which was fine.  However, I quickly have come to realize that this is a very fun, addictive game to play with a group of 3-4 adults.  Our favorite variations are The Tower and The Well (I think those are the right names).  We've even had individual timed races to get through the whole deck.  Excellent little "30 seconds to teach" filler.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Several mini games using a deck of circular cards with the same premise; be the first to find the matching symbol on any two given cards.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: It takes 20 seconds to explain, a minute to play, and quickly becomes addictive after that. The different mini games are actually well thought out giving some very different experiences out of the same mechanic. Has that edge of your seat adrenaline feeling that will bring about big cheers, heavy groans, and plenty of laughter. 

Cons: It's hard to keep things from getting out of hand. While the cards are of reasonable quality, this is the type of game will put them to the test... expect damage after the first trip to the table. There's also a good chance that excitement will cause unintentional throwing of cards, hands disruptively flailing in the way, and other nuisances that keep the game from being a smooth going experience. Can become additively annoying when people don't know when to stop.

Other: I still can't believe that any two cards has one and only one matching symbol on them. I'd love to see some fan made mini games come out, the game seems perfect for it.

Best Use: An all around great starter, filler, or evening ender for folks of any age.

Fun activity to just find matches with the kids at their own pace...

With the older kids (5-year old twins), we still avoid direct competition (ie playing the game by its rules) because it causes too much stress for them.

On this play, Hazel, who just turned 2 years old, was able to find matches between two cards - and reasonably quickly, and she seemed to be having fun.

A fun dexterity and pattern-recognition game. I do enjoy the game with the right group.

More than the game though, I enjoy the maths behind the cards. Having one and only one icon match against every other card.

Awesome game for reflex. It's a very nice change from games in which you need to think.

This is probably the best introductory board game I have, so much so that I own it twice and both copies are showing their wear.

People who don't like speed games LOVE this game.  Since I love speed games, and know too many people who don't, this game is one of the best!  

Yes, it's silly for a bunch of adults to be matching juvenile kid oriented shapes.  But at the same time, it's more interesting that standard playing card matching.  I think there's a NFL variant too, but barf to that noise!

It's short, it's portable, it's laugh-out-loud fun for me and GB. It's a bit too simplistic and perhaps just this side of too short for me, thus the 8 rather than my knee-jerk 10, but as a quick, before-dinner or before-bedtime game, this fits the bill, so I give it 8.

Keresd a párt! Nem olyan könnyű amilyennek hangzik, én hajlamos vagyok ugyanazon pár képet nézni, és nem elvonatkoztatni. A fun faktor az, hogy ha meg is van a pár, le kel csapni és ordítani a kép nevét, amiből csapkodás és makogás lesz leginkább. :) Mii sokan játszottuk, és úgy bizony elég követhetetlen, de mindenképp jó poén!
Azóta szerváltam egyet. Családdal 4-en sokkal jobb volt! Követhetőbb, de ugyanannyira szórakoztató! Végignyomtuk mind az 5 variációt többször, és azt, hogy mennyire élvezte mindenki, mi sem igazolja jobban, minthogy Anyum az első játék alkalmával már meggyűrt egy kártyát. :P Más játéknál idegbajt kaptam volna, de itt nem zavar. (Na jó egy kicsit...) Egyébként érdekes, hogy nem minden verzió fekszik mindenkinek; nagynénémnek pl. a torony nagyon ment, de a forró krumpliban rendre tök utolsó volt. Ezzel bizonyítva az is, hogy minden korosztálynak ajánlható! Nekem egyébként a fém doboz is tetszik.

The problem with any speed game aimed at kids is that it usually devolves into fighting.our youngest just can't keep up with the older two on this one. The older two kids really enjoy it, and I have to admit that I did too. There are cases where players spend a lot of time searching, so it isn't always a shouting match on each turn.

Bellissimo filler per partite all'insegno del divertimento. Il gioco ricorda Jungle Speed e Fantascatti, anche qui infatti conta colpo d'occhio, velocità d'esecuzione e mani veloci. Simpaticissimo party game che sconsiglio in più di 4 giocatori. All'interno il regolamento per giocare a ben 5 differenti (molto simili tra loro) giochi. Ottima scoperta! Coinvolgente, fa sempre venir voglia di riprovarci!

RATING: 7.5
Producing a deck of 55 cards where each card has an element in common with each of the other 54 is an impressive feat of combinatorics in itself. Making an uproarious, noisy and fun game out of it is merely very clever. Making FIVE uproarious, noisy and fun games is nigh to a work of genius.

In my grumpy gamers'-middle-age, I am far more impressed with this sort of thing than yet another iteration on the Euro VP Salad or the trashy-backstory random dice roller.

Smart mechanism for this graphics matching game.

Based on one play: Another speed based game. You get a card with a lot of symbols on it and then there is a stack placed in the middle. As the cards pass you want to see a match with you card and then grab the card in the middle before others do the same. Grab the most cards and you win. Fast, kind of fun, but would likely lose its appeal quite quickly.

You flip a card up with different designs on it and if you have a card in your hand that matches one of those designs you shout out the name of the design (e.g., "Fish!", "Question Mark!").  The winner of a hand is the one who can match all their cards first to the cards that have been flipped.  Good for younger players, those who like fast reflex games, or very light card games -- but those with color blindness may have a harder time as although all the design objects are shaped differently they are different colors which should enable a non-color blind person to identify matching designs by color at an advantage.

"Spot it"(眼明手快)，每張牌上面都和別張牌有一個共同的圖案(大小不計)，每個玩家一開始先獲得一張起始牌，遊戲開始後盯著中央牌庫，如果發現相同的圖案趕快喊出來並起拿走牌庫最上面的那張牌，牌庫整個被拿完遊戲結束，比誰拿到最多牌就最贏，這是其中一種玩法!!!!!

RATING: 9.5

One of best if not the best party games I've played. Easy mechanism of spotting identical symbols between two cards makes it easy to explain. It's a perfect game to play on a meeting with friends especially in they are no players. It also a good filler between heavier titles or a game to play at late night when everyone is too tired to play something requiring thinking:) Five possible game variants (or rather four as fifth one is not really balanced) allows the game to be played few time in a row without being bored of it:)

I don't mind this much.  Others think it's too much like SlapJack.  It's true that this is a quick-reflexes game, akin to set, only there is little pre-processing to find the "set" because the "set" is always a single item.  One item on your circular card will match one of the 8 items on the face-up card.  Find it before others find theirs and snare the card.  Probably a good pre-reading kid game.

I've seen this game so many times at stores and have had zero interest in playing it.... Until a friend introduced me.  Now I see the fun in the simplicity of it.

You can start playing this with anyone within 2 minutes and still feel challenged.

RATING: N/A
Wonderful. Each pair of cards has one (and only one) matching icon on it, and from that rise a whole bunch of ways to play the game. You can look to get rid of your single card by pawning it off on another player, you can try and claim the most cards, you can try and get rid of a stack of cards, and all of this is done by trying to find the single matching pair of icons on a card, which is made slightly more difficult because the icons are different sizes. Very clever concept, and a blast to play with any ages.

Extremely simple, yet extremely fun. Spotting those common images just makes a good game. Every once and a while you'll just be like "what the heck, there's no common image!" ... but it is. It's always there but you don't see it :) People tend to form different memorization / encounter techniques to get better at this. After a while, once you learn all the pictures, it's a little bit easier.

Alright, so I'm a gamer. So it would almost be embarrassing for me to say that this was fun... But it was. Me and my daughter went at it, and we had a blast. Real time looking for matching symbols. It's just fun. Takes about 2-4 minutes for a game. Just good clean fun with some brain exercise for young kids. Highly recommend it for young kids between 6-10. Adults can have fun as well. I wouldn't pull this one out to play with a group full of adults though, but that might be my elitist gamer attitude coming out. Shame on me.

Dobble is a small and incredibly simple game, but is so much fun. It's essentially a more involved version of playing "Snap", where you have to see the common figure between your card and the communal card in the middle. Once you win a round, now you have to re-memorize everything on your new card.

Kids seem to be way faster and better at this game. But the simplicity of the game means that anyone can learn to play in seconds.

I think this is a pretty essential filler game to have around for any gamer.

RATING: 6
Fast pattern matching reaction time game... a genre I don't usually enjoy but seem to be learning to appreciate. This one is interesting due to the mathematical property of the cards (every pair of cards has exactly 1 symbol in common, which you want to find quickly). And it's amusing that I've played it in English, Esperanto, and Polish, sometimes with different players calling out what they find in different languages. Useful for learning vocabulary...

RATING: 7
My ultimate ice-breaker, game night finisher and energizing/refreshing filler. It was the first game I bought. I think any collection should have something for quick mindless fun, and this game fits the spot perfectly. It also amazes me how easily and fast this game puts total non-gamers into gamer mindset. Just throw it in and in a minute people's attention is fully taken by the game, they are laughting and already having fun!

RATING: 5
28-03-2015. Rated after 5 plays. Very, very simple box of 5 mini games. Each mini game is a variation on the same theme. The game revolves around circular cards that contain collections of smaller and bigger icons. 

All games revolve around quickly identifying matching symbols to get cards, get rid of cards, push cards onto your opponents etc. 

It's quite ok. I mean, I normally hate these kinds of games but this one is not bad.. I mean.. not horrible. I still rather play anything else given the choice, but I think for it's genre this game is decent.

RATING: 7
This game comes with a deck of circular cards with a bunch of different icons or pictures on them. Every two cards will have exactly one icon in common. Can you spot the common icon before your opponent? This game is a lot of fun but gets very loud at my house. Probably my kids favorite game of all right now. Fun for adults, too!

I don't know why this game got me to start playing board games.
I don't know why this game works so well with non-boardgamers.
I wish I could give it a 9 or a 10, but it's lost its initial charms with me; but still a stellar game, still a perfectly well made design.

RATING: 7.3
--Jan2011-- Amusing set of games with cute round symbol-matching cards.  We played one hand of each of the five "games" provided.  One ("Poisoned Gift") seemed distinctly weaker than the others; I probably wouldn't play it again.  But all the others were delightful.  I expect I'll (eventually) pick up a copy.
--Mar2011-- Found a copy.  My two youngest were enthusiastically delighted with the game.

Very cleverly designed little speed game.  This is such a quick and easy game, requires almost zero setup or explanation, and can be played with a variable number of players and among all age groups and across cultural barriers.  All you have to do to play is recognize two symbols in common.  

I have played this with kids and it has always been a huge hit.  It plays so quickly I often use it to end a study session with my students, and my nephews love it.  Perfect 5-minute filler.  

I haven't tried it with fellow gamers but I imagine it could actually be an pretty intense party game, if everyone can get past the kiddie veneer.

Genialna gra imprezowa, którą ze względu na małe gabaryty i niewielkie wymogi co do zajmowanego miejsca można zabrać ze sobą praktycznie wszędzie. Zasady tłumaczy się dosłownie chwilę, a sama pojedyncza rozgrywka trwa parę minut (które zlatują bardzo szybko), dodatkowo nie ma większego znaczenia, czy ktoś już grę znał, czy nie, liczy się refleks i spostrzegawczość. Świetny przerywnik, dla rozbudzenia, aczkolwiek w odpowiednim gronie dobrze też radzi sobie jako główne danie.

RATING: 5
Excellent for smaller kids. Played well with my 3.5-year old son. The only slight problem is the few places they used words like "STOP" and "OK" instead of just pictures. The kids pick up on it fast enough, but it takes them longer than the pictures. (Within 2-3 games, though. So it's not so bad.)

However, all the kids have to have the same ability, and there's no fair way to level the playing field. The best I could come up with is that better players have to find not just a match on their card, but also on an opponent's card.

A light, little reaction game that is clever and is great for a bunch of laughs.  One of the better fillers that I've played in a long while.

I've also rested it this high as it is a big hit with my daughter.  It's a great visual memory tool for children as well.

Gaming equivalent of those early facebook games where you had limited amount of time to find certain matches or items. Unlike Jungle Speed this one is made so one does not get better in the game, but there's also no learning curve. It's a quick fix of utter concentration and quick visual recognition. You blink any you'll lose. 

Fun for when you want a filler of this type.

RATING: 3
[2017-03-25]
A játékban minden kör alakú kártya 8 különböző szimbólumot tartalmaz. Minden két kártyán pontosan egy szimbólum azonos, de ezek mérete eltérő lehet. A játékban van 5 különböző játék, amelyekben mindig az a fő cél, hogy minél gyorsabban észrevegyék a játékosok két lapon az azonos szimbólumot.
A Kút játékot próbáltam először, amiben az egyenlően kiosztott lapoktól kell minél gyorsabban megszabadulni, méghozzá úgy, hogy az éppen látható laphoz megtaláljuk a sajátunkon levő egyező szimbólumot és akkor eldobhatjuk.
Nekem az UNO-t juttatta eszembe, de szerencsére annál gyorsabb. Főleg gyerekeknek lehet ez jó fejlesztőjáték is akár.
Nem az én játékom, de gyorsasága miatt inkább ehhez ülnék le, mint az UNO-hoz.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, quick pattern recognition game. Another plus is that, unlike Jungle Speed, GeistBlitz and other dexterity games, there is little risk of injury here. The manual boasts five different ways to play, although most feel pretty similar to me.

RATING: 7
A nice filler, even for adults.  It is a simple pattern matching game that has a primary speed element.  It has a couple of different ways to play and rounds can be played very quickly.  A big plus is its portability and capacity for it to be played just about anywhere, like waiting in line, in a car, etc.

RATING: 7
Quick, fun, portable game(s).  Which yield the occasional interesting insight re how you (and others) process (or fail to process!) information, both visual and auditory.  I'll be curious to see if these 5 games exhaust what you can do with the cards or if other variants get written.

Thus far, levalet.com appears to be the only North American vendor for this game.

This is a silly speed game. Actually, it's 5 games in one. We played all 5 rounds. The game is a deck of round cards showing several pictures and/or words, in various sizes and colors. The games involve various versions of flipping several cards and people racing to find a common element between the revealed cards. It is a lot of silly fun!

Spot it! is an extremely fun party/filler game, one where you will laugh and yell and turn your brain to knots before you turn it into goo. It is easily playable with people with very different backgrounds, it is quick, it comes with different suggestions of how to play it; a great little round box to bring to fun gatherings. Very likely, I would never seek it out myself, besides all the fun it is a bit too redundant in my personal taste, but I would be happy to play it when brought to the table.

Enjoyable pattern recognition game. Has a bit more going for it than Set because of the different sets of rules you can use. Also, very suitable to play with children.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Spot it! is difficult for me to rate fairly. As a children's game, I'd rate it 9 or better - highly recommended.

For play with adults, I want something meatier, and I prefer the controlled chaos of Jungle Speed on the rare occasions when I might want pattern matching for laughs, or the added logical element of Bongo if I want pattern matching that will scramble my brain.

There are several rules variations included, but all of them revolve around matching icons on the cards. Each card has 8 small graphic images, and for any two cards there will always be exactly one match. That sounds like it would be too easy to see, but with different orientations (the cards are round) and different sizes, it can sometimes take a surprisingly amount of time to spot the match.

The game plays quickly, and even very young kids can play (my grandson could play extremely well at 2 1/2). The images are interesting, bright and colorful, and as an unexpected bonus serve as vocabulary builders: small kids can spot matches that they don't have words for, but will learn quickly what to call them as you play.

The cards seem quite durable, and the tin they come in is small, with no wasted space. I've seen the kids sit happily playing with the cards by themselves, too. If you have small children, I'd strongly recommend picking up a copy of this inexpensive game.

tl;dr: more an activity than a game

Be the fastest to find a match between the card in the middle and the card you're holding. First to empty his hand wins.
Of course this is one of those speed games where the player who is just a tad faster than the others will win every time.
For me this is not unenjoyable, but you don't really have to make choices, so it's more of an activity than a game for me.

Bardzo przyjemna, luźna gra imprezowa. 

Plusy: 
1. Kompaktowy rozmiar. 
2. Przyjemne grafiki. 
3. Solidne pudełko. 
4. Kilka wariantów rozgrywki (można też pokusić się o wymyślenie własnej). 
5. Proste zasady. 
6. Świetna zabawa dla wszystkich. 

Minusy: 
1. Jakość kart (średnia) 
2. To tylko przerywnik miedzy konkretniejszymi tytułami lub rozrywka na kilka rozdań. Całego wieczoru nią nie zapełnimy. 

Gra sprawdza się świetnie już od 3 graczy. Warto ją mieć we własnej kolekcji i trzymać w barku. Polecam i oceniam na 6,5/10

This is quickly becoming my most played game. This is a perfect filler as each game takes less than 5 minutes. The game is ripe for re-matches. Very clever how the game is constructed where each card has only one shape that matches a shape on another card. Very well designed and the cards are holding up really well.

RATING: 9
(Rated as children's game) As we approach 3-years-old, my daughter has gotten much better at this game.  She can occasionally grab a card before I spot the match, and given about a 10-second handicap per card, she can play competitively.  It's not my favorite of her games, but it's fun to play any games competitively with her.

Update: 4-year-old.
We're hitting the sweet spot with this game.  I still need a handicap, but it's as simple as "spot both players' matches".  We're pretty near even with that handicap, and I don't need to pause to count (which certainly disrupts the fun of the game).  I enjoy it more now, and she seems to also.

This is an interesting little game. It works decently well at parties, and is very light weight in terms of actual weight but also in terms of complexity of the game as well. I would say that it's a game for non-gamers, and isn't anything special, but isn't bad either.

About [thing=63268][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=63268][/thing] is a pattern recognition game, and is played in real time - usually in a great hurry.

It got a small set of rules and can be played by anyone that can see and talk.

Is playable and thaught in less than 5 minutes.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
This is so simple that the description fulfills everything: each card in [thing=63268][/thing] features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins!

There are rules for variant games included, always keeping the speed element.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
None. Just find the symbols fast and talk quickly.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Fast, being also easy to teach and to play;
- Small and very portable;
- Language independant;
- No learning curve - even small kids can play evenly matched with adults.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- No real decisions;
- Real time isn't something everyone likes, as it adds some stress and frustration to those that fail a lot.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like playing a competitive match of Whack-A-Mole - you need to be fast and precise. It isn't a game of politely waiting or for those AP prone.

[thing=63268][/thing] does a good job in entertaining without any sort of rules overhead, or to check the rulebook, and it doesn't even require dexterity or extroversion - simply the skill of recognizing symbols present in two cards, to properly spot it. Recommended.

Simple and engaging fun stuffed into a small deck of circular cards.  It activates portions of your brain that you don't ordinarily use when playing games in order to recognize patterns quickly, and this makes for a refreshing experience.  It is a great challenge for all ages, this is one game that kids could legitimately beat the parents at.  I'm really bad at it, but I still like it.

Fantastic!  Right out of the box, our not-yet-4 year old was nearly competitive.  This was the hit of Xmas.  And, no doubt, it would make a great grown up (drinking?) game.  Throw it in the box as a substitute for Jungle Speed.

Nobody wanted to stop playing.

absolutely EVERYONE loves this one.  comes out at nearly every gaming session.  why don't you have it???

I have Spot It! Holidays.

This is not really my style of game (I'm not observant enough), but it never fails to get people yelling and laughing.

It moves so fast that the immediate reaction is, "Let's play again."

All the variations are great, and it's surprising how even someone way behind can catch up because they have longer to look at the cards while people are taking others.

This is an ingenious concept, and it really works well. Great for all ages, too, which is a plus.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy of this from the company.

All the Spot It! games are fantastic for kids, and fun for an adult filler game as well. It's a simple, time-pressure picture-matching game that's surprisingly fun, and great for age 5 and up. Five minutes or so a round. A must-have for every classroom, as well as for all gamers.

Play it with spouse and 4 year old daughter (she gets only 8 to 12 cards depending if she has a good or bad day ;-).
Even the 18 month old boy can't stop saying "the car, the car,.." when he watches us playing it.
Everyone's enjoying it.

This game tickles a nerve cell that you don't use everyday.
To win, you must reach a state of "ocular relaxation", and make abstraction of what the other players say and do.

The perfect filler game! It's the only game that continuously wins people over and has them coming back for more.

Granted it's not heavy on tactics or theme or manufacturing, but instead its snap on meth-amphetamine. In every game you enter a stressed out world of self induced pressure which is only alleviated after your last card is placed down.

On camping trips it's not uncommon for 3 packs to be put into play for the ultimate game of Trobble (triple+dobble=Trobble) and ultimately leads into collective swearing and unrestrained laughter!

The perfect speed recognition game.

Several, very different ways to play. Although basically the same speed matching, different players are usually very good at some game modes than at others.

The clever mathematics behind the cards/symbols (zero maths skills required to play) means that it can never "break" unlike for example Set.

The two-player game is pretty cute, and works quite well as a speed game, but it's not really a friendly game to a colorblind player.  Don't get me wrong: The colors are different enough so that you don't confuse one color with another, but it's just that getting stuck trying to recognize a color sort of hangs up my brain, especially when the game tricks you with different items using the same color scheme.  I'd play it again, and might even buy a copy (I can see developing other games using this deck), but there's definitely a hindrance that colorblind players might encounter.

This perception/speed game is just a pure flow experience delivery system. I love this game to death. It's so simple this is the only non-traditional card game my grandmother is willing to play. Aside from Dixit this is the one game all my non-gamer friends love and some of my best boardgaming experiences are with this game. Shouting KITTY multiple times in a row in the middle of a bar with my friends standing up laughing for example.

I made some variant versions with words, those are great too.

We mostly play the double handed hot potato version (you have two cards, can't put one of your cards on the card in your other hand), sometimes with the infinity variant (as soon as you're out of cards, draw two. games ends with one person having the whole deck, don't take it too seriously, but this is literally non-stop fun)

Cool little party game. If you want to socialize at a convention or in a pub don't look any further - you can explain all the rules in 30 seconds. It's a blast if you treat it as a quick warm-up game and play it with an easy-going group of people. Lots of laughs guaranteed. I won't give it a higher rating as I would never suggest playing it over my other games - it's too simplistic for my taste. But there's definitely time and place for it.

Excellent for pulling in a crowd of people standing around as it can be played standing (and one-handed), and play is animated.

This is quick, zany, and can be pretty fun.  There's not much deep satisfaction to be had from playing this, so it's not something I'd seek out, but this would make a great slaphappy game.  To the folks who love to play that sort of thing, [b]buy this game[/b].

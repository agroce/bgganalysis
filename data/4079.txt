New Gryphon Games edition ("What's My Word?"). Probably the best two-player word game I could ask for. Very engaging and rewards both deduction and the delight of playing with words--a creative mix that means a lot for replayability. The fact that the game rewards players for points scored along the way rather than just for "who is first to guess the other player's word" makes it highly tactical and rewarding. As a result the game feels very Euro-style while still appealing to Scrabble and Yahtzee fans as well. Components are high quality (the flaps that hide the words are esp. useful). The box takes up very little space and should be great to travel with. Highest marks!

I’ve just printed my own sheets out for a car journey and had a few trial games. This is a great mental challenge especially for me, as deduction and words are some of my weakest areas. I’ve only played twice but have yet to come close to getting a word correct. This has some elements of the old game Mastermind about it. I was also useless at that. This is a good, simple, yet challenging game.  

UPDATE:I finally solved my first word which was - 'Acronym'

{many plays} Well worth making your own copy (I did! - it's just a piece of paper), this 2-player improvement on Jotto is (cough cough) letter perfect.  All the "fun" of Jotto (if that's your thing) *plus* a wonderful scoring system that rewards you for solving your opponent's word early... if you're clever enough to know how to capitalize on it.  If you found this game by accident looking for Knizia's game of the same name, STOP HERE.  FWIW, I've always heard this one was "invented" by Prince Joli Kansil (the Montage/Marrkesh guy).

I like word games in general, though I think Scrabble takes way too long to play in real life with 3-4 players! What’s My Word is a new take on word games as it’s perhaps more of a deduction game; the other player writes down a word which you need to guess by asking for words which score you points compared to if the same letters are used in the secret word. So far we’ve only played a few times, so we’ve agreed that we only choose nouns. What’s My Word might drag on when trying to decipher the 7 letter word as you constantly need to go back and evaluate the previous information. 7 letter words are definitely way harder than 6 letter words! This was an enjoyable game which I’m sure I will play in the future with my wife who also likes word games and deductions!

RATING: 6
A surprisingly good game from 1972 along the same lines as Mastermind but with letters instead of colours and the added challenge of creating words that will score high points along the way. Very portable and suitable for playing while travelling. Probably worthwhile laminating some sheets. My only (minor) complaint would be the scoring. Why use 250 (right letter), 1000 (right letter in right place) and 3000 (right word) points when 1, 4 and 12 would be less likely to be muddled when adding at the end?

In several plays on a cross-country flight, not once did my companion or I deduce the other's word. In no game did we both give only correct clues. We still enjoyed ourselves, though.

I have mixed feelings about word games; generally I prefer games (and puzzles) in which all the information needed to win is inherent in the game, rather than being dependent on a large vocabulary.

As others have said, this is essentially Mastermind with words, though the varying positions of the guesswords make it more interesting than Mastermind.  The combination of logic and wordplay may either frustrate fans of either or provide an interesting blend, depending on taste.

Personally, I feel kind of neutral about it.  I doubt I'd suggest playing it, but it's a solid little game and I'd be happy to spend a little time with it now and then.

You attempt to discover your opponent's Gamewords by using Guesswords with letters that not only appear in the Gameword, but that also fall in matching position. By the last turn of each round, if you are clever enough, you will be able to correctly name your opponent's Gameword and score a special bonus. You are the winner in My Word! if you have the higher score at the end of two rounds of play.

Very simple mechanism with slightly confuddling scoring (you really need to go through some examples to be clear) but a clever word puzzle game. You actually win by scoring more points than the other player, so making words to maximise your score can work better than getting the actual word.

Mastermind with words. This is my new favorite word game, and the absolute perfect game for travel, bed, or even playing with a friend long-distance via texting.  It's more than trying to guess your opponent's word: it's really about getting points by being able to come up with words that are similar to your opponent's word with letters in strategic places. It rewards a good vocabulary and plays like a puzzle.  But don't be fooled into thinking this is just a light 30 minute exercise - the games I've played have taken about an hour and a half - although you could play with a timer to speed things up.  It's addicting and awesome.

Marry a word game and a deduction game and the result is What's My Word?, a clever and challenging two-player game from Joli Quentin Kansil.  Originally released as My Word in 1972 by Gamut of Games, the game has been given new life by Gryphon Games. One wonders why it has been out of print for so long, as the game truly is one of the best word games ever designed.

The simplicity of the design is part of its beauty.  Each player jots down a six letter word and players alternate stating words and scoring points for letters that are present in their opponent's secret word.  The idea is to correctly deduce the opponent's word, but in doing so, score as many points as possible by having letters in the words you state fall in the same location as they are in your opponent's word.  


In spite of its simplicity, this is one tough game.  Tough, that is, to play well.  Attempting to guess your opponent's word is quite challenging, especially when you don't know exactly where the letters are aligning.  When your opponent announces your points, you must deduce whether you have letters in the correct place or not.  For example, if your opponent says you have scored 1000 points, do you have one letter in the correct place, or four letters not in the correct locations?  The challenge is to formulate words that will reveal correct letters, narrow the possible locations, and eventually deduce the secret word.  This is a daunting task, one in which word lovers will revel.

Some have compared the game to Mastermind with words.  Such a description is quite accurate.  To play well, players must have an extensive vocabulary, keen deduction skills, and exercise creativity in formulating words.  Crossword puzzle aficionados, vocabulary buffs and puzzle fans will likely be enamored by and excel at What's My Word?  Common folk -- such as me -- will likely find the game frustrating, particularly if one's opponent falls into one of the categories listed above.  My wife is a dedicated crossword puzzle solver, and she adores the game, taking great delight in running roughshod over me whenever we play.  In spite of my poor performance, however, I readily recognize the brilliance of the game's design.  It is a fantastic game to play with your spouse or friends, and a great one to carry along with you on a vacation or getaway.  I am thrilled that the game has once again been made available.  It deserves to be in constant print and become a staple in every household.

What's My Word is the language gamer's retort to Mastermind, set in verse and formally structured, with subtle undertones of Hangman and Scrabble.  

That is to say, it takes the classic logic game, and basically wipes the floor with it, at least for me.

The game builds towards an end-of-round word identification in several rounds of guesses- all of which must be valid words. It's more than just a sequence of colored pegs, vocabulary is key, both in target words selected and test words chosen.

Also, players score points for the letters in their test words which match the target word, so that even mid-game guessing can be productive towards winning.

Finally, it adds a second round- which is great for me, because I want to play this again by that time.

This is a terrific update- I only wish I could find more folks to play it with.

RATING: 7
Intersting twist on the classic puzzler 'Mastermind' in which instead of trying to deduce your opponent's colour code you're trying to deduce his secret word by asking him to mark a series of attempts at the word. You get points for each letter in your attempt that appears in the code word. contributing to your final score and giving you clues as to what the code word is.

Each player sets a code which his opponent must try to break, which is an improvement over 'Mastermind' in which the code setter had nothing to do other than mark his opponent's attempts at cracking the code (although I guess you could achieve the same result with two Mastermind sets).

Your guesses also have to be valid words which places a further restriction on things.

One word of caution: given that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and the words/codes to be deduced are 6 or 7 letters long, the letter/code permutations can be much greater than in Mastermind so the analysis required can be quite lengthy if you want to make the best moves possible.

(Aka "What's My Word?" The Kansil, not Knizia, game.) Mastermind meets Hangman--a fine-tuned & improved Jotto. A deduction game that requires vocabulary. Very nicely designed: Progressive scoring adds a layer of strategy; even if you solve the word early, you have to exploit it by offering high scoring words to fill the remaining boxes. Downside is other player does literally nothing while you're thinking...and thinking. (See my [thread=365739]review[/thread].)

My Word! This is like Jotto to the square - it doesn't just take deduction skills to guess the right letters and then find out the secret word: the winner is the player with the highest overall score and both players score after each attempt to find out the word, so that consistent play can by far outweigh a lucky guess at the end of a round. Plus, in a further turn of the screw from Jotto, instead of guessing on just words of the same length as in Jotto, players need to choose words with different lengths, and check their similarity with different excerpts of the word to be guessed.

Needless to say, My Word! needs a HUGE command of language (in fact, it could be almost any language), of course it is also demanding in terms of logical thinking, and it requires as well good timing to beef up scores. This might sound like an unbelievably heady game, but it's actually very crisp, very replayable and perfectly portable (it could be played with pen and paper). It's as challenging as it is satisfying. For fans of word games it's absolutely essential.

Incredibly good word deduction game. So much better than its ancestor, Jotto, and its progeny of TV fame: Lingo.

The biggest difference between this game and Jotto is that you have a very good chance of guessing the word by the 11th turn. Jotto, on the other hand, can go on for an agonizingly long time, while Lingo, because it's Jotto for TV, requires at minimum a computer interface to play it. (Jotto, by the way is very, very challenging.)

What also makes game play faster is that you're trying to guess your opponent's word with much shorter words, which greatly speeds up the game. 

Probably the best part of this game is that you can simply print out the PDF score sheets and play it immediately.

a great game for my mom and i - i LOVE deduction games and she loves word games. match made in heaven. this is basically Mastermind with words. this is made for 2P, but it could easily be played by more, with each person scoring the person to their right. in fact, the more i think about it, the more i believe that this would be best at 3P, because you need some downtime to formulate your guess. it is very much multiplayer solitaire, but lots of fun, if a little brain-burny.

don't buy the whole game, just get the refill scorecards from the manufacturer's website.

This game is challenging, for sure. Since I'm a librarian, everyone stereotypes me as being into word games, but guess what? I am not that great at word games and this one is hard. I'm not one to be deterred from something if it's too hard, but the gameplay doesn't lend to a very social feeling. It's fun when you guess the word early and then you can try to come up with words that score the most points. It's not fun when you have no effing clue by your fifth or sixth word and you keep shooting in the dark. It would be good for taking with you to play in waiting rooms or traveling.

It's Mastermind but with letters instead of colors, a point system instead of black/white pegs, and a more programmed and different (ask about specific subsets of the word -- smaller portions of the word, using actual words) way of asking questions. Fun, but it will definitely take some practice to get better at this game!

Excellent game to play on the couch in between conversation. We are not huge on word style games but this is more akin to Mastermind, which we enjoy.

[DIY] [Word; deduction} My Word! is an interesting word game mixed with deduction.  It is a quiet game for 2 persons, esp. suitable for word game lovers.

[Gryphon Games edition] This edition is surprisingly expensive (as other Gryphon games).  I am concerned that only pencil and papers are provided, and players are forced to print/purchase score sheets.  Why can't they provide a dry maker solution for repeatable plays ...

Ups: Great deduction word game, it is like a mastermind of words but far more streamlined. Downs: Long downtime among players. No interaction, it looks like a puzzle vs puzzle.

I find this an interesting Lingo-esque game with simple rules but a lot of strategy, thought, and deduction. It's tough to see a 6- or 7-letter word in life now without thinking, "Would that be a good WMW word?" Extremely low interaction - basically two individual puzzles.

This game is brilliant. I love how even if you have figured the opponent's word, there is still the puzzle of scoring the most points with your remaining moves. Pure genius. I just wish I could play it more.

For a word game, this one is one of the better ones.  It's a word game and a deduction game woven together into one, and it's an interesting challenge.  I like the way that the players have to deduce the words based on the points they receive for a particular guess.  It reminds me of the different paths to a solution that players have to follow in Code 777, but where the questions you ask (such as they are) are up to you, and not up to the cards.  I think even folks who like deduction games, but aren't big on word games, would find something to like about this one.

My impression of [b][i]What's My Word?[/i][/b] is tainted by the sour feelings of my first two opponents: one who dismissed the game as a glorified [i]Mastermind[/i] with a bonus AP problem if a player is stumped and the other isn't, and another who hated everything about the game, finding it stressful and unfun.

My third opponent was a perfect match for my desire to dig into the logical challenge of the game and work through all the possibilities of what word he was hiding from me. In the end, I can appreciate the challenge of the game and the cleverness of the design – a word game in which logic trumps dictionary knowledge – but still not feel driven to find more opportunities to play.

A Mastermind-style deduction word game, this is a lot of fun and an amazing restaurant and travel game since it is so portable with nothing to clean up, lose, or get dirty.

Mastermind with words? And two guessers at the same time!? And you can play on the couch!!! Gwen I both *really* enjoy this and are amazed how much time drifts away while we're trying to come up with the best words for our guesses.  The best couple's word game we've found!

Note: Plays will list single sheets.  We might play many sheets in one sitting, but each is its own game to be won or lost.

This game is excellent!  My family uses [thing=11821]Jotto[/thing] as a pastime in restaurants.  I hope I can persuade them to do this one sometimes, instead!

Update:  They dig it, but [thing=11821]Jotto[/thing]'s less painful to interrupt when the food arrives.

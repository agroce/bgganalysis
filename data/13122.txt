There is so much going on here to understand fully without playing more. Similar depth and feel to Roads & Boats but a very different game and the variable victory conditions allow for several strategies. The sort of game I really love but never devote enough time to. Long, but time will reduce with experience.

Novel resource management / civilisation building game, very low luck.  Pollution management is the most unique and interesting aspect of the game, as it compels the players to build towards each other in what would otherwise be a multi-player solitaire game.  One of the most fiddly games I've played though, as chits are constantly placed on and removed from the board, which makes me think that it would work better as a computer game.

It's brown brown brown and has a TON of weird little chits, but it's awesome. It's an epic game of civilization building, and it features a large map of the land AND individual maps of your cities that you fill with buildings and stuff! Way cool!

On the other hand, it has [i]all those chits and tokens![/i] o_0

Es un juego de planificar y gestionar mucho, duro, pero de reglas muy sencillas a la vieja usanza para jugones, dura entre 2-4 horas, y es mejor para 2-3 jugadores. Le llaman "catan advanced" pero tiene muy poco que ver. Tiene un detalle en la gestión con el tema puzzle de los edificios, a lo principes de florencia. Como defencto, a parte de las mil piezas pequeñitas que puede abrumar, es que es muy solitario, con prácticamente ninguna interacción entre jugadores

RATING: 9
Combine the resource managment of Settlers, the buildings from Puerto Rico and the city/population management aspects of La Citta. Add the bits from Roads & Boats and a splash of Tetris, throw it all in a HUGE box and you have Antiquity. Essentially micromanagement of a medieval city and the surrounding countryside in a box - but in a fun way! There is so much to think about in this game. Every turn you have a half dozen buildings you [b]really[/b] need to build and an equal number of resources you'd love to collect but good luck pulling that off! Just keeping yourself from drowning in graveyards and pollution is a major accomplishment. For those that worry about the low level of player interaction, it is low but not that low. You certainly have to be considering the other players right from the start but it's not something that is up near the top of your priority list (which will be rather large)! Actually, I couldn't imagine having to consider the actions of other players right from the start of this game, you have more than enough to keep you busy as it is already. Some have mentioned the possible low replayability of the game. The victory conditions seem a little unbalanced as well leading you to think that you should be able to follow the exact same strategy game after game and get away with it. I doubt this is the case. There are advantages and disadvantages to each saint and much of what will go into your selection of one will be determined by the tile distribution and your access to resources on your chosen starting tile. Given that there are 4 sets of 4 tile types, each of which is double sided there are plenty of different combinations available to keep subsequent plays interesting and full of choices.

Wow, this is indeed a bear. Not bad. Enjoyable, really, with the buildings and the various powers you can get with the right patron and all of the disasters to mitigate: the graves and the pollution and etc.

The first part does feel very much like a multiplayer solitaire, where you're trying to figure out how to best exploit your side of the map and maybe you're just grabbing resources and your opponent is trying to be more sustainable in her efforts.

Eventually, though, as you're trying to build a new city or scavenge further for resources, you'll bump into your opponent and try to put your workers near their land to pollute them and etc.

Very fiddly, but not really complex, I'd say, and fun.

I was so looking forward to playing this game, and once I did I was wishing that I were still looking forward to playing it for the first time.  So much so that it immediately came off my want lists.  

It wasn't at all a bad game, and on the positive side I would happily play it again but I really wouldn't care to own it, even at half the price it would take to get it.  It a nice game but it's not that special, very fiddly and there are so many ways to screw up if you aren't 100% clear on all of the rules.  At least the game is a little forgiving and a serious error early on can be overcome by good play.  But I have real concerns that every play of the game would be far too similar to the last.

A game worth its price. At the beginning mostly solo-optimization to get the city productive fighting increasing famine and pollution, at the end competition to claim last unpolluted lands. One of the only games I've been dreaming of during the night after the first play..

+ The first civ game that actually felt like one. Brilliant and pleasantly agressive. The more I play it the more I love it, I've been trying the different victory conditions and man, I think they all work. This is a masterpiece.
- Several components are badly printed, which is unacceptable on an expensive game. It is also likely that one or two bad decisions completely eliminate a player, making this 3/4 hours game a scary one. NEVER EVER GET IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE NO WAY OF GETTING WOOD.


No, I don't think this (or any) game is worth 150-250 dollars.

RATING: 7
Very very fiddly.  Do not go here if you thought through the Ages was too fiddly, or if you have opponents that like throwing board pieces around when they lose.  Lots of small counters.  I'd compare it to a wargame in terms of fiddlyness, and encircling your opponent is one way to win.

On the other hand if you like economic engines, they all seem to deal with managing the details.

The best way to store this game is in Plano's or small bead boxes.  Ziplocs don't work well unless you are going to pour the counters into bowels, because you constantly need to get at the counters.  Did I say fiddly recently?

Pass the graves.

BEWARE: Only played once...didn't even complete the play. So take my comments with a grain of salt...

Didn't seem like my cup of tea...Though I might try it again.

The Good:
- A LOT of starting actions
- Feels like a basic race against the clock as things get worse and worse
- "Fuck You Over" potential is high

The Bad:
- Too many possible starting actions
- Fells like a basic race against the clock as things get worse, but it's not cooperative
- "Fuck You Over" potential is high
- LOTS of board management and manipulation and the pieces are TINY.
- Feels like a steeper learning curve than a lot of games isn't necessarily more complex, just a LOT more complex upfront.

To be fair this game almost certainly gets better with more plays, but given other options I don't know why I wouldn't just want to play one of those games.

RATING: 6
Let me start by saying: This would score far higher if it weren't just SUCH a brain burner. It's currently the next day, and I feel _exhausted_ after my first play. The rules aren't hard but the game itself is entirely unforgiving.

If this game has an issue it's that it's nearly solvable. Once you have determined *how* to win, it's a matter of executing your plan before your opponents execute yours. That said, there is not a significant amount of replay value with Antiquity.

Sikerült kipróbálni egy igazi különlegességet. Az Indonesia után számítottam rá, hogy ez sem egy egyszerű játék, ez be is igazolódott.
Kezdem a kicsomagolástól: nem a szokásos nagyipari minőség, még csak be se volt fóliázva, egyedi a dobozmérete, stb. de többek közt pont ez adja azt a fajta báját, amitől nem az a 12 egy tucat játék. Ez az egyediség nem csak a külsőségekben jellemző, a szabályrendszer sem majmol más (általam ismert) játékokat, talán egyedül a tetris szerű épületek emlékeztetnek a Princes of Florence épületeire, de ez a játék sokkal komolyabb annál.
A szabály megdöbbentően rövid ahhoz képest, hogy mennyire komplex (jelenleg 4.3 a BGG-n) maga a játék, az általam eddig próbáltak közül egyedül a Die Macher bonyolultabb. A bonyolultságot azzal érik el, hogy a kb. 25 féle épület felépítésében, és általában a stratégia megválasztásában nagyon szabad kezet kap a játékos. A legzseniálisabb az egészben az, hogy a győzelmi feltételt mindenki saját magának választja ki, amikor felépíti katedrálisát, és védőszentet választ magának. Nagyon kombinatív az építkezés, mivel az akciók sorrendje tetszőlegesen variálható. A csúcs az, hogy bár mindenféle meglepetések érhetik az embert (nincs nyersanyag, nincs hely az épületnek, túl sok a szennyezés, nincs elég személyzet, használhatatlan az épület sírok miatt, stb.), szinte mindig kínálkozik megoldás. Nagyon elmések az épületek, pl. az egyetemi karok működtetése és hatásai, a szemétlerakó védő hatása, az ellenőrzött területeket növelő épületek, és a termelés lemodellezése is a kis lapkák egymásra pakolgatásával. De a csúcs az a dillema, amit már említettem, hogy melyik szentet válasszuk, nem csak győzelmi célt, hanem extra képességet is ad mindegyikük. Nagyon tematikus a játék, a középkori építkezős hangulat nekem átjött, a két gonosz algoritmus (szennyezés és éhínség) kapcsán különösen a sírok sikerültek ütősre, és nem mellesleg morbid módon precízre: 20 féle különböző  halott neve szerepel az egyes sírokon, mindenféle külön funkció nélkül. Viccesek ezek a hollandok:) És mellesleg rendesek is, 1 kis token hiányzott a kb. 1300 darabból, és egy egész kinyomó tartalmát (kb. 100 tokan) küldték el, le a kalappal!

Ami még fontos dolog: a szerencse szerepe szinte 0, talán egyedül a felfedezőnél jelenik meg, nagyon korlátozott mértékben.

A sok pozitívumról egy kis összegzés, aztán jöhetnek a negatívumok: A játék nagy élmény, innovatív tartalmú, patinás külsejű, komoly játékok kedvelőinek kötelező szerintem. A szabály kimondottan egzakt, nagyon jól leteszteltnek tűnik.

Negatívumok:

Amit pozitívumként írtam az egyediség kapcsán (egyedi csomagolás), az kicsit negatívum is, mert könnyen sérülhet szállításnál. Nem olcsó a játék, de ezt tudjuk be a ritkaságnak és a sok kütyünek. Ami furcsa, hogy pl. paravánt nem adtak hozzá, pedig a legfontosabb fázis elvileg titkos, és a szabály utal is paravánra. A sok kis token kicsit körülményessé teszi a játékot, hiába zseniális a termelési modell, ha sok ideig tart felpakolgatni a szennyezéseket, árukat, stb. Ami már a legelső, 3 fős játékban is kijött: kevés a sír!! Szennyezéssel persze pótolható, mert abból majdnem 500-at adtak, de a sír látványosan hamar elfogyott (ennyire bénák voltunk?). A térkép lapokon a folyóknak eltérők a színei: néhány térképlapok kék, másokon szürkés. Ez direkt van? A szabályból nem derült ki. Az egyik stratégia túl erősnek látszik, de erre a szabály is felhívja külön a figyelmet. És végül a hossza: a sok mütyűr miatt a ki- és bepakolás összesen legalább 1 óra, a szabály 1 óra, maga a játék 4-5 óra (3 fővel), de haladóknál ez jelentősen rövidülhet. De mindenképp túl hosszú ahhoz, hogy örök kedvenc legyen. Jó ha évente elő fog kerülni 1-2 alkalommal.
---
Újra előkerült. Néhány módosítás: Szent György azért nem legyőzhetetlen, hacsak nincs egy játékos, aki a többieknél jóval gyengébb, mert ezt ki lehet használni. De ha egyenlő felek játszanak, akkor Szent György védhető, ezáltal akár teljesíthetetlenné is válhat. Ha így vesszük, a legbizonytalanabb győzelmi cél. A szabálymagyarázatra 1 órát írtam, azt félre módosítom, viszont az 1500 token pakolgatása irtó macera. Szerintem világrekorder abban a tekintetben a játék, hogy egyféle jelölőből 472 db van benne. Ez több, mint amivel a teljes játékteret le lehet fedni, nem bízták a véletlenre. Örülnék ha előkerülne évente egyszer a játék, mert az egyik legjobb amit valaha próbáltam.

Finally played the game with pollution and famine at the very beginning of the game and WOW.  That hurts and I love it.  There is so much suspense and tension to try to have your city not grow graveyards  like weeds.  This game is certainly a lot harder with the famine/pollution phases included.  Now, I feel that the game is more balanced as you can decide on how you want to deal with famine and pollution or not to deal with it at all.  Looking forward for the next game.

I liked the idea and the murky theme of the game but it felt too punishing and too cerebral for my taste. I'm not sure about its replayability either, with basically interaction-free and randomness-free gameplay you could (and probably would) do same things each game. On top of that it is a very fiddly game (a lot of tiny counters to set up and move during play).

I love how Antiquity combines worker assignment(/placement?), area management and planing ahead without ending in victory point grabs like almost every other Euro. Famine, shortage of resources and waste are well integrated into the design and not just another mechanism thrown in like in Tzolk'in or Agricola. It punishes you when you don't pay attention how much famine you will have to deal with and even kicks you out of the game if you run out of wood. It's fiddly, but if you embrace the extra time it takes to put this multitude of tokens down to get some extra theme in, it's extremely rewarding.

Nice management game. In a medieval landscape you build the economic infrastructure of your city state and use the products to develop it, feed the population and avoid urbanization problems (basically famine and pollution that increase death rate).

I never felt like this was a game I had to play, but I figured I should play it, at least once. While I like the idea of some civ games, I really don't play board games that are civ games. At some point, the fiddliness and maintenance that players must perform during the game becomes excessive, even for me. If I were going to play a another game like this, which I won't, I would probably choose to play it on a computer. There is a large map with hundreds of tiny hex spaces showing grasslands, mountains, forests, water and more. I would bet there are more than a thousand or so tiny little cardboard chits about the size of my pinky fingernail that must be added to this board with tiny spaces. Sometimes, items are being stacked 2 or 3 high with pollution, wood and worker, for example. As a person with relatively thick fingers, it wasn't always easy to maneuver everything and I'm sure there are others who would have more trouble than I was having. There are also Tetris-like pieces which are buildings that each player fits into their city board(s) - those city boards are separate from the big map. I struggled through a 3-4 hour game of building up my cities. I did survive to the end, so yay?

This is yet another of those games where I can appreciate aspects of the design and how it works and I am glad I tried it. And, I'm less than ambivalent and I won't bother with another play.

----------------------
This sucker is mean... but yet so much fun!  I can see why this isn't for everyone, but I had a blast playing this one.  My first game with 3 players took 4 hours including rules.  There is a TON to explore here with multiple win conditions and tons of player interaction.  This is one I can't wait to try again.  

I think my only negative is that the game is very fiddly, and if you really don't pay attention, you could take an action that could just end your entire game.  I don't think I would ever play this one so "mean" that I wouldn't find a solution to helping that player out, but it is easy to do if you don't pay attention.  The components also are pretty terrible, and the color choices on some of the chits were very poor choices.

Truly great game. Starting to get to the point where analysis of start positions is key and makes a real difference to your choice of victory condition.

-1 for the amount of fiddly.  Makes Agricola feel extremely non fiddly.  For example once you have a field, pollution, good and square stacked up it's just begging to topple over and crash into the next pile.  Proper storage of the 20 different types of chits, and housing and squares is essential.

Too long & too much effort for my taste.  The learning curve is pretty steep, and there is likely a scripted approach for success (at least at the start).  Skip the storage building... instead build a cathedral very early and choose the patron saint that lets you store unlimited goods (you don't even need a worker in the cathedral for unlimited storage!).  I think this game has more chits than any other game that I have ever played.

This is quite a game. If we are comparing Roads and Boats, I prefer R&B, but this is a totally different game really. You have the feeling of precariousness throughout the game, but it can certainly be controlled. I lost on the tie-break in my first game, so the ending is never a certainty until it comes. I wish I could take the walls from Roads and Boats and build 'em around my ZoC, ha.

THE Civ Building game at a micro level.  Between this and Through the Ages, I don't need any more epic Civ games.  Managing construction of buildings in your city(s), plus pollution, plus feeding, plus somehow trying to reach a victory condition that you chose?  The game is brilliant and very replayable.  This isn't multi-player solitare, but you're also not beating up on each other too badly.  It has a great balance for me.  Love this game.

Finally got this to the table as a three-player game.  Took a LOOONG time with all newbies, but can see how this will speed up a lot with more practice.  Really, REALLY liked it -- kinda dry, nearly perfect information -- just my kind of game!  Update:  after a few more plays, upping this to a 9.5.  This is definitely my favorite game of the moment (July 2006)!  Two-player games now clock in at 2 - 2.5 hours.  'Nother update:  I can't resist any longer.  It's my second 10.  Experienced two-player games are now less than 2 hours.  Player interaction is relatively low, but significant -- clearly those who claim it's multi-player solitaire have never had a player with a manned dump encroach upon their territory!

Antiquity est un jeu de stratégie vaguement inspiré de l'Italie au Moyen Age. Les joueurs choisissent leur propre condition de victoire. Ils peuvent se focaliser sur la croissance de la population, le commerce ou les batiments des cités en choisissant un Saint Patron. A chacune des stratégies correspond un style de jeu tout a fait différent. Aussi, un joueur peut-il décider d'adorer Santa Maria - la Sainte la plus puissante - mais il lui faudra construire une civilisation deux fois plus impressionnante que les autres joueurs.

This is a good game of planning and resource management.

However, there are some problems with this game:

1) It's fiddly. A thousand little chits that get lifted and moved constantly

2) There's TOO much planning. Even other euro die hards in my group found this to be too much. It gave us headaches planning all this out.

3) It's multi-player solitaire. Much of the game is just that. Though there is some player 'interaction' when zones of control overlap, the large part of it is multi-player solitaire.

4) It's not fun. Again, the result of too much planning. There are a lot of alternate choices for this type of game  that is simply more fun.

5) It's unforgiving. As the rules states, it's a very tough game and players can be eliminated from insufficient planning.

6) Low return on time investment. It took 1.25 hours to explain all the rules. And then the length of the game was too long for the little fun we got out of it.

Unfortunately, despite this being a good game, my group won't be breaking this out any time soon.

This will be an unusual 7.0 in that it's not likely to get played again.

This is probably the best civilization building game that I have played to date.  It is less fiddly than roads and boats, but still provides a lot of variety.   I'm not sure how balanced the victory conditions are, but I suppose good players could make any of them work.  I'd almost rate this a 9 given how difficult it must be to pull off a successful game of this scope.

Wonderful. One of the best "city-building" games I've played, with a lot of interesting challenges and many unique mechanics. It really gives you a visceral sense of planning a city from scratch, working and tilling the land around it, and watching your small population grow into a bustling metropolis. I love the idea of dealing with the ramifications of pollution, of having to carefully plan for limited city space, of depleting resources and clearing forest for farmland, and farming/fishing for different resources. So many cool and original ideas here. I also love the overall design and aesthetic: while playing, it feels like you've found an old, antique board game in a dusty cupboard.

Yes, the game is extremely fiddly—probably the fiddliest game I've ever played—but for some reason that doesn't bother me. If I had one major complaint, it would be about how punishing the game is. If you miscalculate your wood production or forget to plan for it, you can easily find yourself in a situation where you literally cannot do anything else for the rest of the game, which I find unacceptable. Punishing inexperienced players so badly that it instantly takes them out of the game is too harsh. I would add a house rule (maybe just for beginners) that a player may forfeit their entire turn, using all their workers, in order to gain a single wood during the harvest phase later that turn. Otherwise, the game can end much earlier than it should.

1/28/18: After hearing great things about this game,  I was very disappointed to have experienced what turned into a frustrating,  6hr. exercise in super tiny/fiddly chit management.  It was almost a dexterity game at the drawn-out end.  Oh,  it's also VERY unforgiving for first time players (I was out of the running after the FIRST round due to my poor initial city placement),  AND it lends itself to greater AP as the game progresses; a lethal combo.  

This is really a computer game that was unfortunately born as a board game.

UPDATE: A year later I remain a fan of Antiquity, but I think it's hit the end of the line for me, and a little sooner than I would have liked. There just isn't enough inherent variability in the game, and so play became pretty constrained and samey fairly quickly, at least in comparison to the game's general size and scope (a big culprit here seems to be that the Cathedrals don't seem well balanced; only a couple seem like viable winners, so you see them over and over and over ...). I like the design, and have enjoyed it, but am not generally that enthused about playing going forward. I'd rather go back to Roads and Boats.
---
I rather like Antiquity, so don't get me wrong on this. But this is as close to a computer game in boardgame format as you are likely to get. Relentlessly analytical, long, punishing, and full of fiddly micro-management, this game has a counter density that makes Hube's Pocket look sparse. For me, what makes Antiquity fun is the fact that you are constantly flirting with disaster. One wrong move, and your civilization will be circling the drain (this is not actually true, but it certainly *feels* like it). This is not so much about good play as about avoiding  slicing your wrists with all the sharp objects lying around - but the huge win for Antiquity is that the danger comes from a fairly tight game system, not from lots of chromy rules or special powers. The game is actually fairly easy to play.

I am generally not a big fan of analytical games, but if you're going to make such a thing, this is the sort of game I like. Too complicated to be easily parsed out in minute detail, it's about intelligently managing a swirl of details and coping with the inevitable mistakes.

There are still some problems here. I think Antiquity works best when the players are not interacting - once cities start colliding, the game starts to creak. The turn ordering rule is not very robust, in that it appears being first is a big advantage, and the way to make sure you go first is to start out going first since the tie-breaker is whoever went first last turn. The one time the game can really bog down in excessive analysis is when players start to plot out their inn and city placement when facing real competition from other players. And the amount of counter-fiddling is a bit excessive.

But all in all, Antiquity provides a unique and worthwhile gaming experience for those who don't mind spending 4 hours on a game, who don't mind the micromanagement, and for whom the journey of the game is the important thing rather than the competition.

An added note: One of the other reasons I like Antiquity is its stark environmentalism (not surprising given its Dutch origin). The environment is a limited resource which the players consume and destroy, and the failure to manage environmental pressures will lead to ... difficulties. It's a great message, skilfully presented.

RATING: 9
I really enjoy games that mercilessly punish the players, and this one does a great job of it!  You're always staving off starvation and trying to clean up the pollution that your cities create, which makes it really tough to progress toward victory.  Good stuff!

This is also one of the more manageable Splotter games I've played.  With Roads & Boats and Indonesia, I get slightly overwhelmed with the amount of pieces and activity going on.  In Antiquity, there are a ton of chits, but you're not manipulating so many of them simultaneously.  In general, they're just marking resources that you'll harvest each turn so there's not a ton of shuffling around.

Overall, this has several things that I love in a game:
- The feeling that disaster is constantly lurking around the corner.
- Engine building.
- A multitude of winning strategies.

Awesome stuff!

I love how this game forces you to balance expansion with waste management and resource usage, very progressive. I also love how your actions and choices have consequences that run all the way to the end of the game.

However, the game is very fiddly, which I could live with, if it wasn't that the combination of very little luck and no early interaction and little late game interaction, leading to stagnancy in our early game strategies (it doesn't have to, but if something worked last game very well for you, there is no reason to not do exactly the same thing the next time).

Woah! That's a lot of bits! Very frustrating grasping those teeny squares. That and the fact that the game is solitaire for a good portion of its ample length make me side with the 'better as a computer game' argument. Once the terrain is revealed, you can pretty much mail in your moves. Games that require 6-7 turn lookahead are just not my cup of tea. That said, the actual gameplay is pretty nice, if you like playing against a challenging game system.

[u]April 2008:[/u] I only played the game with 2 players and it lasted 3 hours. Supposedly, it gets shorter with practice (and I don't find it hard to believe).
Loved the game for the challenging management and the complexity of the game. I didn't care for the supposed lack of interaction and never really felt it (the battle for the good fields can be very aggressive).
However, the tons of chips to manoeuver each time you wanted to do anything was way too much for me and made the game nearly unplayable. Be sure to check that you are ok with that before you buy it. Be sure you are ok with a (very) steep learning curve.

decomposing my rating:

complexity, challenge: 10 (without a doubt)
fiddliness: 1 (I don't put 0s)

I'd love to play another time though... But directly with a good player, to see how he does, because I really couldn't feel myself playing over and over to get there because of the fiddliness.

*I hope I'm using fiddliness right...

This is a long brain burner with very little player interaction. I quite enjoyed it but I am not convinced it is a great game. It is a game of highly focussed micromanagement. You are on the same board so towards the end of the game you are competing for resources. The interaction is only an occassional case of someone taking what you wanted. I think La Citta is a better city building game with far more interaction and it plays in half the time. I am torn between giving it 6 and 7.

OK Very Good game between princes of florence, vertigo ( pollution ).
But have you a lot of time to spend to dispatch pieces of the game ? You have to follow some principles of game ( on the first round to buils some wood...) and you can not fight your opponents before a lot of time. I can't stand this kind of game for which you think a lot of ideas and in fact you have only - once you win - to quote round by round what you have done and reproduice the next game ( only one conditions of victory need to dominate opponent lands )

My initial impression is very good.  Splotter certainly makes some of the types of games that appeal to me most.  It is long and evolving, like Roads and Boats, but there aren't really too many similarities to that game.  It does fill a similar niche for me, though.  As one practical bonus, there are no large plastic overlays to deal with - which is nice.  Lots of paths to victory and lots of choices along the way, so it most likely has lots of replayability.  Looking forward to more plays.

This game isn't cheap but I think it's worth the investment. For me, the game is definitely worth the cost of the 3 mediocre games I would probably have in my collection in its place. I've only played Antiquity a a handful of times but each game has been a lot of fun. It's a little like Agricola in that each player develops an independent board while fighting the basic game system just to stay alive. In the games we've played so far different paths to victory have won the game. And for me, that's a big plus.

What a masterpiece of game design. Its large, has lots of chits, and a fair amount of logistics to work through (but nowhere near Roads and Boats level). But there are some impressive aspects to this one.

I love that each player can choose a different winning condition, even mid-game, by building and dedicating a cathedral.  You can even change mid-stream. I can't think of another game like that.

Also, I can't think of another game that is so harsh and unforgiving. In the first game I kept thinking to myself, "How am I supposed to get out from under this mountain!?" The crises of pollution and famine were nearly overwhelming. A very satisfying game to play, and more finite and playable than its brother Roads and Boats.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Antiquity is a hard game to shoehorn into a traditional category list...at its most basic level the game is about managing tight resources in the face of initially overwhelming odds. Players begin the game with a small pile of wood, and with that, they need to erect buildings which will allow them to create yet more resources out in the countryside, which then be tithed for yet more buildings, which break the rules in yet more ways. 

The basic tension of the game is the need to combat the constantly increasing famine level, and to stave off pollution. Famine naturally drifts upward, and requires stored food to offset. (storing food is in itself an action and requires a building too) If you don't have enough food to cover the famine level, you have graves taking up your city. Pollution, meanwhile, is the constant left-over when you grow anything on the countryside, or when you fish or mine. Pollution covers the landscape and makes it unusable. You also create pollution just by having cities. Hence, the early part of this game is just about making sure that you will have enough food to keep ahead of the famine level (or that you will have some way to take care of the graves being created) and that you will have some way of keeping pollution from choking your city to death.

After players have managed to get these problems under control, they can then concentrate on actually winning, which is possible in a few ways such as building all of the different buildings, collecting goods, or surrounding the opposition.

It's hard for me to accurately describe my feelings about the game. It's enjoyable enough and I've liked my early plays. It isn't particularly long (3 hours with some explanation, 2.5 without) and it seems to have some interesting things going on. Interaction is relatively sparse until midway through the game, but just dealing with the problems that the game was presenting seems to provide enough of a fight for the early part of the game anyway. I have lingering doubts though. Subjectively, it just didn't blow me away and make me feel that it was doing anything particularly well. Sure, I enjoy the PITA factor of dealing with pollution and graves on a certain level, because just having things under control can feel like winning in this, but I don't know if that is enough to really carry a game for me. There should be variety here because of the different winning conditions and the various available buildings, but it feels like the game will have a sort of similar flow as well...deal with famine, deal with pollution, then deal with winning. A building here and there should be substitutable, but the basic fight is going to be with the game system of graves and famine rather than with the other players for at least the first half of the game, and to me that is usually a problem because it means the battle is going to be identical from outing to outing. This issue is hard for me to fully articulate right now though, perhaps it will either gain clarity in my mind with further play, or perhaps it will vanish. I think, most simply, I prefer games where I am battling the other players throughout rather than the game itself. Really good games have high amounts of both (i.e.: Age of Steam) but this one seems to be leaning much more heavily in the direction of the game system itself, which limits my interest in some ways (similar to co-ops). I think it feels like a protracted fight with the game system, and then a sprint against the other players. Mildly unsatisfying. 

This sense of mild dissatisfaction continues to linger with a second play. In the first play, the problem of dealing with the pollution and the famine seemed almost overwhelming for much of the game. By the second, it seemed minorly irksome, mainly because I already knew several different ways to get out of each situation. I find this problematic, because as I said above, most of the game is the fight against the game system...when that ceases to feel difficult or compelling, this game loses its edge. The saint that hands out the infinite store house ability is particularly bad in this regard, I could see recommending this ability to brand new players, but for me it just seemed to make the early game too easy, especially after having played the first game without it.

As it stands, this is a good game that I would be willing to play again. I rate it like I do because relative to the other games of this depth that I play, it is not high up on my list, again, there is nothing here that cries out for table time to me. I like some of the elements that are on display here, and it is certainly worthy of occasional table time, but I do not see myself ever recommending this, as I think it has a lot of similarities to Civ II, and the computer game has the benefit of being a true solitaire game that I can pull out at my leisure.

Lighter and not as brilliant as roads and boats, still a very good game. Difficult to master in the first play if you decide to play with pollution and starvation (we did, it was fun to take the challenge, lots of graves...) but it is possible if you listen to the warnings and have enough food production, wood and storage. Lots of pressure to find the right buildings to build, if you don't have enough land / ressources to fight pollution and famine you go down slowly and painfully. Player elimination is possible, also you might not be able to fix early mistakes and just play along for three hours. Might have a smaller long term replay value than R&B because of fewer strategic options.

My oldest son calls this the "death and famine" game because the negative elements of the game pile up on the players so.  It's a bit of a solitaire game at first, but quickly moves into one where the land grab creates intense player interaction.  I really don't care that it's fiddly with its zillions of counters.

Great game.  I like that players determine their own winning conditions which leads each to following different strategies.  Early resources are scarce, leading to interesting and at times difficult decisions about how best to allocate them.  The theme worked well for me, I particularly liked how the pollution worked.

Very much enjoyed my first play of this game.  I spent several early turns fumbling, trying to get stuff to build stuff to get more stuff, losing sight of my goal.

This is a sadistically cruel game.  I spent 95% of my first play gasping for life, afraid every turn that my entire civilization was going to come crashing down.  At the end, I immediately wanted to play again, which is saying something since it was midnight and four hours after we had started.  I don't think any game has ever grabbed quite so severely after just one play.

RATING: 8
So far I've played the full game only 4 times and mostly with other beginners, so read my comments in that context.

I really like the rules system, how harsh it is and how limited my options are compared to all the things I need to do. Despite this, I've been getting the feeling that the game's mostly solitaire nature will give it limited replayability. It seems that there will emerge a mostly optimised approach to each saint, tailored to the map, that can only be majorly disrupted by a San Giorgio player. However, since even experienced players seem to still like the game, I'm hopeful that I'll be proven wrong.

A beautiful game about building, managing resources, and hardship. Truly a beauty in game design the mechanic is so interwoven and makes you thinking very hard. This game rewards fore-planning so much that a wrong move could literally took you out of the game. Very unforgiving game.

RATING: 8.5
Fiddly as hell, but worth the effort.  A progression of production steps similar in style to that in Roads and Boats, but with bigger concerns - graves filling your real estate, expanding borders of other players encroaching upon your own, pollution rendering your land useless, and choosing a relgion that will dictate your victory conditions.

There's a lot going on in this game that I LOVE. The unique win conditions based on your chosen saint, the polyomino city-building component, the pollution/depletion of the land, the mounting pressure of famine and the ways players can combat it--there's a ton of really interesting decisions to be made and valid strategies that can be pursued.

But the game is too long by an hour, extremely fiddly, lacking in meaningful player interaction, and clumsy in ways that are totally unnecessary (e.g. poor delineation between man/unmanned buildings, a "secret" simultaneous stage that is impossible to actually execute secretly). 

Its good qualities definitely make it worth playing but they aren't so good that I'm able to overlook its faults.

RATING: 7
Stressful, fiddly, painful, cumbersome, unique, and brilliant. That's how I would describe this game. And while I wouldn't call the look of this game 'ugly', it is very bland. The chits and countryside tiles are completely fine, and in fact, I think they fit the theme well. The player aid and buildings, on the other hand, are quite uninteresting. 

Some mechanics I don't care for (such as Tetris-like fitting of pieces into your city), but despite this, it's a great game. 

I want to play this more, as I know I will enjoy it with more familiarity, as is the case with most Splotter Spellen games. I'm not sure why they call it pollution given the time period. Perhaps "overproduction" or "desertification" just don't have the same ring.

OMG!  LOVE IT!  My saint was San Christofori in my first play. If the game went another turn I would have won or at least tied.  Glad my first play was so enjoyable, so WHEN I have a crazy, difficult game I will remember how it CAN go ;-)

I LOVE this type of game, one I can really immerse myself in a story of building up my civilization. I've only played a half a game (along with a solo game) but it was amazing. I don't think it will get played often because of the long playing time, so I am really glad it has a solo variant. 
11-23-13 played a three player game, still loving this.

Brilliant, brilliant game. Straight resource acquisition and building game, with the need to stay ahead of the curve of death by pollution or graves.

RATING: 8
Players develop medieval cities by working the surrounding countryside for materials.  Large, involved boardgame that requires a lot of space.  Players play in two areas - the "country" where workers produce materials, food and luxury goods; and the cities where players build different structures that give players additional powers.  Working the land creates pollution, which must be dealt with if you want to work the land again.  Inns and new cities spring up, rapidly gobbling up the countryside and it's resources.  Unchecked pollution will start producing graves in your city, denying building abilities.  Players win the game by constructing a cathedral in one of their cities and dedicating it to a saint.  The saint chosen also chooses the victory conditions.  Similar size and scope as Roads and Boats, with the decision tree possibly being more complex here.  Lots of different buildings and strategies to consider, tons of bits to move around, and a similar length to Roads and Boats.  Strangely, I found this a bit easier to play, as you don't really have to worry about the transport logisitics - you simply produce, build, produce, build.  Very good.

Excellent game, but holy fiddly batman! At it's core, it is a city management game were you manage the growth of your city and try and deal with the effects of pollution and famine. The building are of course of different shapes and offer different powers and the starting city is too small to get all of them in, so you will need to expand, which will bring more pollution to your cities...
The mechanic of not having a victory condition until you build a church is quite clever, as is the choosing of said victory condition. it allows for the player to see how things progress before committing to a victory path. 
Now, at least in our first game, it is a little bit of a solitary game (with the game being firmly against you), but nonetheless, i think aggressive play can be done, if only with pollution.
Lots of fun, but be prepared for some paralysis and lots of bits manipulation.

RATING: 9
Superb civilization-building game which is the closest to a PC game I've played. Most of your game is solo play against a ruthless system, but what little interaction between players exists is crucial in order to obtain rare goods and spread into unclaimed turf. Unlike Tresham's Civilization, this is not an abstraction but a complex production and optimization puzzle. Elegant and challenging, highly recommended over any similar game. If you are willing to invest the time, get this on the table! I wonder about replayability, but then again, this may not hit the table often enough to worry.

RATING: 9
First played at Essen 2004 and have only played with 4. 

Antiquity is medieval civilisation based and involves building cities, farming, fishing and mining. The game is won when your civilisation has fulfilled the victory condition determined by the patron saint of your choosing (there are 4). 

The path to glory is not straight as you would imagine. Your population will suffer from famine if you have insufficient food. Graves will then occupy valuable land in your limited city space (7x7 grid). Your cities generate pollution every turn which has to be dumped in the countryside. These dumps deplete your natural resources that are already limited. Pollution cleanup is expensive. This game involves balancing your most valuable commodities of city space, storage space, area of countryside sacrificable to pollution and manpower. You have to do all of this and fulfill your victory condition before everyone else! 

As if to just to test your IQ further, note that the buildings are shaped like Tetris pieces. You have to plan all of the buildings you intend to build fit nicely (like Tetris). If you don't do this , you may find you have the free hexes in the wrong locations!

Conclusions:
Very gratifying game. Requires patience to learn. Many many many pieces (you will lose some). Large table or floor required (preferably a dark surface). I only rate this 9 for the advanced rules.

Great design, daunting at first, but surprisingly easy to learn. Fun with two players initially, and even better with four. Definitely seems like the kind of game that will increase in enjoyment as familiarity increases and my group begins developing independent strategies. The large number of small pieces is a drawback for some, but I believe it adheres to the theme of city building and farming, making the experience more immersive.

Too long to make it to the table very often, Antiquity does still find a place in my collection and will get played about once every year.  However, I don't see myself playing this as anything but at 2-player game.  Amazing amounts of chits and a brutal (but realistic) pollution track make up for the muted and fairly mundane color scheme.

RATING: 7.5
Just had my first play and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  You have lots of choices in the game right down to whatever you want your specific win condition to be.  Two tips.  Don't run out of wood ("that's what she said") and don't run out of space otherwise you'll be filling your buildings with your own peoples gravestones and that's just a messy business all around.  Biggest downside - same complaint I have with Shipyard, but amplified.  Set aside about 30 minutes to set up and put away the game regardless of how organized you are ahead of time.

It is very fiddly, and maybe those with large fingers should stay away, but man is it good. There are big, game changing decisions you have to make as well as numerous smaller ones that you are forced to make. 

The game is brutal on new players. While not difficult to understand, it is difficult to play well and a couple of games of the into game is highly recommended.

 Most enjoyable new game I've played in years. I do not see this getting stale with repeated play, also I see play time falling (4hours 1st time to 3 the last) with greater experience.
the last 2 player game was 2 hours.

Only complaints - you spend a lot of time putting small cardboard counters on small hexes. I wish they had made everything a little larger. Also some of the counters look similar.

[1 play] I enjoyed trying this out, though I learned by making countless mistakes and nearly bringing my civilization to total ruin! There's a ton of stuff to think about and do here, but it all hangs together cohesively, better than in many more recent games that seem more like an ill-assorted jumble of mechanisms layered on to make the game more "complex." This game felt akin to Roads and Boats probably in multiple ways, but notably the way that at first you're building up your civilization and sort of doing your own thing, then after a while the neighbors arrive and start polluting your territory and harvesting your resources and building things on your land and generally being a huge nuisance.  
Another thing Antiquity lacks that many later games have is elaborate card tableaus, accessory boards on which subsidiary action is going on, or other game components that can't possibly be placed convenient to everyone and thus often end up impossible to see and making the game a misery.  
I look forward to playing this again.

An long exercise in counter shuffling and micro-management.  Like other games of this scope, you're usually one mistake away from doing yourself in without a chance of coming back.

Lots of interesting ideas, but ultimately of limited appeal for me.

This is THE game. A great brainburner themed-euro.

As the size of the box and chits number might suggest, this is a terrific gaming experience : engaging, rewarding but challenging and very unforgiving.

It is a race : you will have to reach your victory condition before anyone else. Pretty simple no ? Sadly not. Why ? Because :

1) the game give you all the tools and liberty to do anything you want : choose your victory conditions but also the number of actions and their resolution order. Wide open means choice to made, decision to take. Not easy to master.

2) you must plan ahead not only to prevent to screw yourself (wood is very important) but you will also have to take into account what other player do. Fight for terrain and resources is crucial and you will require more and more resources to support your engine in an increasingly competitive world.

3) if it was not enough, the game directly attacks the players through famine and pollution, adding tension as the game progresses.

RATING: 6
Rating after one (long, incomplete) playing.  I think the mechanics blend well in this game as regards resource collection, pollution and expansion; however I feel that a game which requires so much time to learn before you can play effectively has no place in my collection.  Our first game reached a point where development became very difficult indeed; perhaps that's the whole point but I can't help thinking this could have been done with more elegance and still achieved the same (or better) results.

I am prepared to give this game another go, I might even buy it if I like it as a result of that second play.  However I just can't see this happening unless one of the other members of our group buys it and we can then assign a whole afternoon/evening/both to it.

Less convoluted than i expected it would be.  Antiquity, although fiddly, offers a deep and streamlined civ-like resource management engine.  There are a lot of elements at play here, and developing an efficient engine to manage the growth of your peoples without choking yourself in barren fields, grave yards and pollution is a supreme challenge.  The various victory conditions opens up a multitude of distinct playable paths.  The game seems to be well-balanced making all said paths viable with no one seeming obviously over powered.  The ability to raze your cathedral, and thereby disassociating oneself with a specific saint and adopting another, only further allows for more depth.  The offering of variable special powers depending on the adoption of a saint is wonderful and also adds to the games colour.  Production values are wonderful, with a strong aesthetic that for me is in the tops of game design.

This game would be a 9 for me if it actually played in 2 hours.  The only reason I've given it a 7 is because it took a friend and I over 4.5 hours to play my first game.

This would be a 10 if it wasn't for how fiddly the pieces are(you practically need tweezers to play the game) and the length of the game means I don't get to play it that often.  But man do I enjoy it.  It needs to be a computer game. I enjoy this more then Roads & Boats.  But it's very close.

RATING: 5
A though brain burner. The first impression after one game was of delightful complexity, but now I think that the most of it was instead fiddliness with the mechanics, and a very tight range of valid choices to do for your first city, just to survive until you'll build the second one. Clear, you can't do everything, and this is overly a good thing with games, but any starting error you'll do will shortly drive your city to self-extinction. Very frustrating at times. And, a strange thing for an urban civilization game, there's almost no interaction between players here.

RATING: 7
Antiquity has some interesting mechanisms, and manages to minimize downtime by permitting the players to overlap turns by an unusually large amount.

Unfortunately, my enthusiasm is tempered by a major flaw: Antiquity is one of the most fiddly games I have ever encountered.  Piles of tiny chits as far as the eye can see.

The artwork is nicer than Roads and Boats, but like other Splotter games, there are a million thin little cardboard bits that can be hard to make out.  Considering that one of the victory conditions is storing up 3 different types of everything, it would have been nice if they made the pieces easier to tell apart from each other.  Is that dye or a fish?  You also have to stack little cardboard things onto other little cardboard things and a large part of what you do in the games involves moving stacking placing little things.  Having said that, I did enjoy the game and it has a couple really excellent ideas.  The mechanic of picking a Saint early in the game, and that Saint determines your 'special ability' and victory condition for the game is great.  The idea of pollution and famine is also pretty darn nifty.  Like Roads & Boats, this game is pretty rough around the edges.  I enjoy it, but it is a fiddly mess in a way.

I was very excited to play this rare game. My criticisms are: 

1)There is too much down time for what the game offers, and there isn't too much to think about if other players are having a long turn.

2)This is one of those games where you have to know the buildings well and know when to build what. I also do not like the space limiting factor and worrying about building buildings in the wrong spot on the player board.

3)I think this niche of gaming is best for pc games, like the civilization series. I get more out of those games than this one.

the pluses include different winning conditions and a very good pollution mechanism. I also like the interaction that there is, although there could certainly be more screwage. A good game, I see why people like it, but I don't think I'll bother with it again. Glad I got to play it.

I like civilization/city development games and this one scratches the itch nicely.  It is a tight game where mistakes can make a player's situation untenable so it needs all the players to either be competent or willing to play with a no-win position.  The multiple victory conditions, modular board and variety of bits makes this a game have a wide variety of ways to play out.

[b]Antiquity[/b] [i]Joris Weirsinga-Jeroen Doumen 2004[/i] Wonderful game experience. My first play was probably better than the normal first experience since the explanation of the rules was clear and perfect (by fellow user Witto) and the players were fast and with no a/p at all. Just an outstanding game, which I feel will be almost for sure the best game played in the year 2010 although I played it on 15th january!!! (in fact three years later I can confirm it). It is a long game but I did not fell that I spent four hours building my civilization as the time flies. Easy to explain but hard to master, with different end game conditions (five), and plenty of different resorces and buildings. Mortality and pollution chits will make you struggle to survive in a very tense way. I can only make two critics on the game, first the fiddly little chits (which is normal since I cant imagine a different way to design it but probably condemns this game to be played only in your home as is extremelly annoying to carry and very difficult to find a table to handle it) and the lack of interaction (actually the only thing that prevents this game to be a 10).

Excellent optimization game. There isn't much downtime usually and tons to brain work to do during the game (but not as much as in Roads and Boats). There isn't much interaction though, it's more of a solitaire. Not my favorite genre, but I can appreciate it and enjoy playing once in a while.

Played this Sat afternoon at BGG.con.  While I did enjoy the game I thought the game play was too much like Roads & Boats to invest in getting a copy.  Same very fiddly puzzle like quality of having to figure the optimal course through the game to your victory condition.  I will play it again if I get the chance, but I'm not sure I'll be the one to suggest it.

It's good--really, really good--but not always good enough to justify the time or fiddliness involved. It's got some stiff competition from tighter, leaner games, and given that it requires the right mindset. Of the death-spiral euros, though, it's clearly one of the best.
{EDIT] Having replaced the pollution counters with discs and the inns with wooden houses, the ease of use of this game really improves. I've come to really appreciate how beautiful the game is, as well. If brisk play can reliably clock in at 2 hours or less, I think I may have to up my rating.

Probably the most pure fun of the brain-burning euros. I always seem to end up awash in pollution and graveyards by mid-game. 

This game has so many things going for it. Beautiful graphic design, wonderful fiddliness, a race to the finish line, and a good theme. You can play with and/or against the other players to varying degrees. Though I've found the game gets more interesting when dumping pollution into your neighbor's lake.

I like games that allow players to set their own victory conditions, and this is one of the best in that regard. They feel a bit unbalanced, but that may just be my misunderstanding. Favorite saint is Giorgio, who seems like the (quickest) winner. Miscalculate a little though and crash and burn and the Crisofori players will probably force labor all their goods for the win. Not sure how to win with Nicolo, Maria, or Barbara, though I will have to try soon.

Playing Splotter games, in my limited experience, is almost always a trip into the archives of board game design (e.g., http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/10538/what-are-roads-boats-attempt-ludomorphology): these grail games are not only events onto themselves but are also a lesson in the innovation of modern mechanics. Antiquity here is no exception (not that 2004 is 'that old'). Now, here's the hard part, imagine a boardgaming world before worker placement (and I say before loosely here, as Splotter had presented us with worker placement in their earlier Bus in '99). It seems like a trope today, but at the time, it was richly innovative and brough us great games like Agricola and Caylus, but again, here we have an earlier mammoth game that still feels fresh today. Throw in variable ending conditions (none of which are "most points"), rich spatial interaction (it's not just a first come first serve race for space, it's also a dumping pollution on/in your neighbours' crops), and interesting variable powers via buildings that you must manage through a tetris sub-game (reminiscent of Princes of Florence), and what we have here is a game that is large in scope but also more than the sum of its parts. Of course, if you don't like fiddly games this might not be for you (as there are so many pieces). However, for a game with this many moving pieces and interlocking mechanisms, the rules are relatively simple and straightforward; furthermore, given that your "annual planning" happens simultaneously, the game also moves at quite a reasonable pace for its size and scope. The brilliance of this game cannot be understated -- 10 years later, it's still a mechanical marvel that provides some rich, gamey moments. Granted, I usually prefer somewhat shorter games that are somewhat more on the tactical side than strategic (e.g., K&K's Mask Trilogy), I can't think of many other games I would want to play of this size and scope that fit in it's time frame.

[Initial Impression: 7] 
An insanely good game. I've yet to encounter another that captures the epic scope of building and managing a civilization, especially because it requires you to manage waste as well as resources. This provides one of the most compelling, immersive, and potentially traumatic gaming experiences that I have encountered. I love it! I really like the ability to choose your own victory condition, although my primary opponent seems to win with Santa Maria more often than not. The only drawback to me is the long playing time, although we've got it down to 2-3 hours now. Check out my session report for my initial experience: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/128618

RATING: 7
Agricola's long lost, bigger, badder, older brother. Punishing as Age of Steam, overwhelming in chits and counters as Squad Leader, doom-y and gloomy as Agricola, building layout planning intricacies of Princes of Florence, with a heavier, more intricate, and darker feel than La Citta. Only Splotter Spellen, the folks who brought you Roads & Boats, Indonesia, Duck Dealer, and VOC!, would take a city-building game to excruciatingly detailed heights of masochistic pleasure. This is two games in one--a strategic game of land grab and resource exploitation, and a tactical game of building layout optimization, resource generation/management, worker placement, and damage control. It is a slow treading-the-water, er, sewage, to stay afloat just long enough for your economic/pollution/death management engine to kick in. It certainly makes me ashamed to be human, as I watch the board gradually get depleted of resources and wrought with 'pollution' markers.

The game is so punishing that you must collect wood in the first turn, or you're dead. The rules told us so--we went ahead anyway in our first game to build fancy, but utterly useless buildings and found that we could no longer build any new buildings. Our first game lasted one turn, at thirty minutes. Well, it's not as punishing as AOS: in Antiquity, you're a frog, slowly simmering in the pot, somewhat oblivious to the impending death clock mechanic of the game, instead of the rapid boil that is AOS. AOS's mechanics are designed to quickly bankrupt idleness, through indifferent phases as "income reduction", while in Antiquity, you are slowly surrounded, and eventually consumed by pollution, and grave markers that take up space in your city grid. It even gets personal, with individual names on each grave marker. If one can survive the initial onslaught of pollution that is dumped outside the cities, and the numerous grave markers that pop up in the cities due to famine, there is a smug sort of satisfaction when one is able to push back the tide with alchemy (to rid of pollution) and hospitals (to remove grave markers).

The theme is similar to Agricola--you're trying to survive. But it is no longer a family, but a city. You must expand to survive, and survive to expand. The resources are scarce at first, reminding me of how scarce grain is in Agricola. From one grain planted in a plowed field, comes three. In Antiquity, you must first find 'seed', be it olives, sheep, or wine, through exploration. Then you send a worker out, and gather multiples of the seed, up to six, depending on the hex orientation. You must man the buildings with workers to give you special powers, like in Puerto Rico, but to get more workers, you must get more resources. You must store the resources in storage, or they will spoil, like in PR after the Captain phase.

There are ten distinct phases, like in AOS or SL, but they are straight-forward. The game is relatively easy in terms of mechanics, dare I say easy to learn, but incredibly fiddly with all sorts of tiny chits to simulate the effects of deforestation, soil depletion, and eventual pollution. It makes sense, but it is this fiddliness that may turn off some players.

There are no victory points like in most Euros, so there is no 'race' mentality. Victory is achieved when a player satisfies a number of conditions, that they are free to select via the choice of saints. All in all, the game plays like multi-player solitaire, with very little interaction, with the limited market trading and area control surrounding the cities being the only exception.

There is a lot to like here, as indicated by my lengthy initial comments. There is also plenty to dislike, as I generally do not like 'survival' games, where I am trying to survive the game. At least the theme of city-building appeals to me, but I like La Citta's brighter, lighter, and advanced outlook--they're concentrating on education and culture, instead of trying to combat pollution and famine. Both games supposedly occur in Italy, but Antiquity is the Dark Ages, where La Citta is on the verge of the Renaissance.

You'd be well advised to set aside an afternoon to try this game out. 30-45 minutes to read the rules, although people familiar with PR and/or Agricola would have an easier time. 3.5-4.5 hours for a 4 player first game. I'm not sure where they get this 2 hour figure from--they must be on drugs or must have teeny-weenie little fingers to handle all these little, like 3/8", chits. Initial rating: '7'.

Update (11/20/09) 2 plays: 5 hours for a 4 player game, with one newbie. I think two plays in a lifetime is enough for me with this game, or I really need a long vacation away from this for awhile. Yes, if you don't get pollution and famine under control, it will slowly, then quickly consume your cities. There is nothing like the feeling of dread seeing your buildings get overwhelmed with grave markers, because you had polluted the crap out of all your ZOC hexes outside your city--trust me, I did exactly that. The newbie had made some fatal errors early on, and was being consumed by grave markers too. Both of us longed for the sweet release of death that is the game being won by somebody--anybody, but not us. The game was rather close, with at least two of us several turns behind the winner, in terms of satisfying victory conditions. Like I've said before, this game is all about surviving the game, and if you can thrive, well then, you win. There is nothing expansive about it, there are no dreams to fulfill, and there is no creativity. It's just dreary, with death and pollution, and there is no fun in that for me. When compared to TI3, which takes just as long, and which is just as intense, sign me up for TI3 any day.

Update (08/09/10) 3 plays: So, I went out of my way to request this game after months away from it. I appreciate the mechanics and game design more, when compared to Agricola and Le Havre, but it is still very fiddly. Forced Labor seems to be the key to rapid expansion, with one player plopping a city in the middle of the board within 5-6 turns! We called it early, since it was obvious who would win. I'm willing to look at this again, in awhile...

Update (11/19/10) 4 plays: A newbie was curious as to what the fuss was all about, so we set the stew pot up again for a simmer. Got half way through (7-8 turns) in about 2.5 hours before calling it quits, although it was a somewhat balanced game with 3 players. It seems you must build the correct building at the right time; too early means you've wasted time and resources. Timing of harvests so as to get your workers back is also key. We no longer worried about exploring, getting seeds from F. Biology and F. Alchemy for pollution, but making sure to build these at the right time. I used to worry about pollution and grave markers, but extending ZOC via Harbor, Stable, and Inns is essential, for it is a land-grab race for the center to be first to plop your 2nd and 3rd cities--there is no time to be worried about pollution (just dump it in their back yard)! Turn order is much harder to change, and requires at least two turns to manipulate it. I am finally coming to terms with this game, as it is quite enjoyable in the proper frame of mind.

I knew after my first play of this game that it would eventually crack my top 10.  I don't change my top 10 very often.  I love the "dark" theme to the game, with all the gravestones you are forced to place in your city each with an individual name.  I always feel like my inaction killed some people and that drives me to try and do better!  The look of the game is perfect and the game play is better.  Awesome.

Some people feel like they’re choking when they play [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing]. I am one of them. I don’t know how, but I’ve become worse at Agricola over the years. My farms have become worse, my play has become worse, my scores are consistently the lowest at the table—by a margin.

And Antiquity creates a mood not unlike [thing=177]Advanced Civilization[/thing] and Agricola might fornicating in an Italian villa. If you think the game is out to get you, you’re right. Advanced Civilization’s calamities are nothing next to Antiquity’s pollution. And the pollution is nothing next to the graves. Oh the graves.

It’s a just plain logistics game. You’re building an engine for the sake of building an engine, playing Tetris so you can build your engine some more; but you’re in engine-building hell. In Agricola, stuff just comes. The Stone Fairy brings stone; eventually she brings whole boars, sheafs of flax, vegetables. In Antiquity, your explorers roam afield, trying to find a virgin piece of land to deforest before someone else does, and then your cities become epicenters of pollution, covering the earth in agricultural waste. You can feel the air closing in on them.

If Agricola is a tango in a linen closet, then Antiquity is a nice evening dog paddle in a pool of warm tapioca: an exhilarating way to go for those who enjoy chronic shortness of breath.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

A sprawling resource collecting and city building game that would have worked better on computer. Sackfuls of tiny counters are required to keep track of all the goings on, and even then interaction between players is pretty minimal. Bottom line is that this takes far too long for the modest amount of enjoyment on offer, and while there's nothing wrong with this game, there's nothing that isn't done better in Princes of Florence or even Settlers.

It's really hard to evaluate this game. I am left with the feeling of having grappled with something huge and not having really ever gotten a good grasp of it. It certainly feels really long, not because I get bored of what I am doing--quite the contrary--but there is a certain amount of stamina required and unlike most games it actually becomes more overwhelming as it develops.  

It's really interesting and I think I'd like to try it again, but, um, not soon. (1 play)

Antiquity is the third Splotter game I have played and so far, it's my favorite. Antiquity smashes together the ideas of Tetris/ Princes of Florence, Sim City, worker placement, area control, and resource management. One of my favorite aspects of Antiquity is that when they choose a patron saint when their cathedral is built, the players may choose which of 5 different victory conditions to pursue which require different approaches and also are associated with one of five different special rule breaking abilities. Antiquity is, by far, easily the most fiddly game I have ever seen. But I don't mind at all. I feel like the composition of all of the moving parts and small cardboard bits is elegant and makes sense. Antiquity presents players with a non-stop torrent of tough choices whose consequences are powerful. While pursuing victory, players will be grappling with the dual urgent threats of pollution and famine, which function differently and can crush you. I love the mechanics of the game and thinking about all of the meaningful decisions: where to place pollution, which building to build, when to build another house which adds another worker. I love the way the number of workers each player has has nothing to do with feeding; instead there is a communal famine level that is rising over time, requiring the storage of more and more food resources to manage effectively. Antiquity feels like a multiplayer solitaire game the first few rounds, but then BAM! there is fierce player interaction scrambling for the depleting resources on the map, players strategically polluting each others' backyard, the market permits players to trade resources, and it is possible to manipulate the famine level via exploration and by building fountains. I love Antiquity. Play it if you get a chance.

Uno de los grandes Splotter.

Se trata de un juego de gestión de recursos en el tratamos de cumplir una condición para ganar la partida. No hay un número de turnos fijos.

Cada jugador comienza la partida con una ciudad colocada en un mapa donde están representados diferentes terrenos de los que se obtienen materiales de construcción o comida al mandar a tus trabajadores. Primera cosa interesante, a medida que recolectas "contaminas" las zonas y dejan de ser usables.

Al inicio del turno los jugadores planifican lo que van a hacer sus trabajadores, si van a construir edificios, habiendo un montón diferentes, si van a expandir su territorio, añadir una nueva ciudad o si van a hacer uso de edificios previamente construidos. Entre lo que se puede construir esta la catedral, que puede ser de cuatro tipos y que marca la condición de victoria de cada jugador (he visto ganar con tres de las cuatro condiciones)

Al final del turno los jugadores deben contaminar su territorio en función de su número de ciudades y deben además alimentar a su población en función del nivel que es para todos igual y que va creciendo.

A pesar de que las reglas no son nada complejas es bastante exigente. A tres jugadores en dos horas y algo (sin explicación) se puede jugar

RATING: 7.5
Crisis management: resource management: engine building: strong Civ theme

Finally played this in 2014 after wanting to for 7 or so years, and, well, it was quite good and everything I thought it would be!  The first 2 turns in the game were really intense, your head was being squeezed in the vice right off the hop, and the pressure never let off all game! There is a crazy amount of options, almost too many, and your typical need to do 100 things but can only do TWO type tension in good games. 

Maybe a pro/con analysis can help simplify and summarize my thoughts here:  

PROS:  

- Strong theme integration; you start with small civ and build it bigger while suffering the perils of such

- Meaningful decisions; chock full of options all around

- Strategic options/multiple paths; The game built in 3 or so paths, and how you tackle that path varies as well

- Tension; the game looks to punish you in several ways and you are always needing to do more than you can

- Rules; well done, so that once playing, rules completely melted into the background

- Luck/randomess/chaos; NONE!

- Replayability; surprisingly with no luck etc, they did a great job of building this into the system with multiple paths and of course the multitude of options

CONS:  

- Fiddy; infamous for this, and well, the chit shuffle and tactical calculations each turn is a little much but its not horrible, its a micro-manager like most civs

- Length; its long but you don't feel it (3 to 5 hours to play depending on your familiarity and speed of play)

- AP; especially bad if you go with worker strat, once you have 12 workers managing this is a bit much/tricky

- Interaction; its very low which I am mostly ok with, but this means mostly playing against game itself, and I could see this hurting replay some since as my friend CortexB points out the famine and pollution are going to come at you relativity in the same way game to game. 

- Balance; Christopher saint seems to be easiest win, and one of the 4 powers was REALLY weak compared to others, these things are easy tweaks if further play confirms these as issues

- Price; would have owned it long ago less this aspect

Crisis management is a mechanic I really enjoy, and this is now in my top 4 games of this ilk along with ITYOTD, Gric & Robinson all great titles for me that really squeeze you in the vice. Depending on which Saint you choose the game can be a real struggle, and even with the one where you gain all powers keeping your engine humming is a real challenge. 

Time flew by playing this as the game is extremely engrossing and demands your constant attention. My winning condition required 20 workers and once at 12 and beyond managing everything along with planning and amount of options available it is quite a chore but one I enjoyed a lot. My rating assumes balance issues are tweaked or don't exist, likely to settle at 8 or 7 depending

Probably my favorite Splotter. Brutal and unforgiving, it's the sort of game where you can render your position completely untenable. Expect some of your early games to end in concessions. But, aside from that, the choose-your-own-goal stuff is great fun, the spatial town building is a gas, the long-range resource planning is fascinating, and the built-in drag of the game's economy is frustrating and entertaining. A great game.

1st Edition - This is a very good game with lots of decisions. It can be a little tedious and I have to wonder if decisions will be the same game after game. The replay value is questionable in my mind so only more plays will tell for sure. If you enjoy resource management (micro?) than you owe to yourself to try this out.

Once you're over the first-game hurdle, the fiddliness doesn't seem so fiddly, you gain a sense of pace and learn how everything works together--you can start having fun. And this is fun.

I taught this to my 8 year old. I had to help him through some spots, and it's not really a kids' game, but the rules themselves aren't that complex.  

Play 2-player for your first game, otherwise it'll be painfully long.

RATING: 8
This is a very good strategy game from the folks at Splotter.  While the components are not great, they are not bad either and have a nice antique look to them.  Each player starts with a city, gathers resources with workers around the city (fish, wheat, stone, wood, etc) that can then be used to build buildings in the city that provide various useful abilities as well as more resource gathering operations like farms and ultimately inns and additional cities.  Meanwhile pretty much every resource gathering operation is leaving pollution behind (other than the woodsmen which just leave fields behind for farms).  Also the cities are filling up with graveyards (the Dark Ages were rough) which render their spaces and buildings unusable.  Depending on which Cathedral you end up building you will have a different win condition.  The game is nicely challenging and until you get the hang of things your main concern is playing against the board, staying ahead of the gravestones and pollution.  Once you build more cities and start competing for good locations and resources, there is also more of a direct competition between players.  Overall, a fun game that is quite distinct from the others out there.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (January 2011)

I think Antiquity might be a great strategic game but I’m not sure as I have only 1 play. It seems the game is hard to master and very unforgiving of mistakes. I kind of like that, but that also means it has a steep learning curve. It also has a long playtime. The games comes with so many bits (and very small too) it´s a little hard to handle them. I believe the luck factor is nonexistent which is a huge plus for me in a heavy game like this one.

I would love to play Antiquity again and I will :D.

Antiquity is a grail game for me. I’m sure I will buy it in the future but for now it is very expensive. After more plays I still like it a lot. Love that you can choose your victory condition, love the hard decisions, love the tension, love the graves :D.

It is still an unforgiving game and that’s the reason some friends don’t want to play it, but for me, that’s a plus. I want to play it again soon. I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG´s recommended rating system, however it has a lot of potential so perhaps it can go up again in personal ratings.

A delightfully masochistic race game.  Derided as multiplayer solitaire, but in the middle and late game there are definite opportunities for interaction, especially in claiming a mountain range before an opponent.  Fiddly -- would shine in a PC adaptation.  This game is very unforgiving and can make for a nasty experience for newbies who don't get it the first time, as their city fills with graves and they are effectively eliminated.

Need to play this one some more before I get to carried away with a comment here...I was blown away by the sheer number of choices the game presents you with in terms of strategies. I was in last place but I didn't eliminate myself so I'll call it a moral victory.  

This is certainly not for everyone and if you're at all on the fence about it try to play the game before you buy it.  That said I can't wait to give this one another try!

I finally snagged a copy of this holy grail of games (2nd edition/2nd printing 2011).  Worker placement, area control, and resource/waste management with (very) careful consideration to pollution and famine, all set in late Medieval Italy...  
 
Only a few very enjoyable 2-player games under our belts so far that give the impression of a multiplayer solitaire game against an unrelentingly harsh game system (tension is kinda-sorta similar in feel to Age of Steam, IMO).

Yeah, all the chits make this game a bit of work to play, but it is worth it. There's a lot to consider, a lot of decisions. The different victory conditions and random board tiles make for decent replayability. Scales well from 2-4.

Upgraded from an 8 to a 9 after more play. I think I'm just a sucker for these "event" scale games.

RATING: 7
Antiquity is an older worker placement game with a mixture of action phases, resource gathering/conversion,  and civilization building. Its influence on current worker placement games is easy to spot and ultimately I find this predecessor to be superior. Modern derivatives like Agricola feel small and feeble when compared with Antiquity.  And while I know the art production is divisive, I am quite fond of it.

The comments concerning fiddliness and game length are overstated. If you can deal with the operations phase and game length in Indonesia you can deal with phase 4 and play time here; however, after a few plays you do wish that placing and harvesting field markers were automated. Because of this Antiquity does feel longer than most Splotters even though it routinely plays in 2hrs. The lack of interaction combined with the resource conversion mechanic causes the game to drag a bit in the middle. For those who enjoy building a resource engine and watching it hum along, Antiquity is fantastic. I would highly recommend it to lovers of Uwe Rosenberg's titles and Caylus.

A quick note on the the infamous famine and pollution phases. They are harsh, particularly for new players but can be somewhat mitigated with proper planning and certain building combos which I won't give away here. I've come close to dying but have yet to fully embrace the reaper. Do NOT play without famine or pollution. Otherwise the game is toothless like many modern games of this type i.e. Agricola.

RATING: 6
Played once with three. The other new player eliminated himself after 45 minutes. I managed to become self-sufficient (my civilization didn't succumb to famine) but that's about it. 

This is a punishing, long, slow-paced game with extremely bland presentation and an almost comic abundance of 'bits.' It takes whole turns (sometimes two, three or more) to achieve basic changes in the game state. It's a very repetitive game. All of this notwithstanding, I'll grant that there is room for complex and varied strategies. For me they just unfold at an agonizingly slow / repetitive pace. The game's challenge is too up-hill and begrudging for me. 

The theme binding is also a bust once you realize that a university alchemy department (guffaw) is key to cleaning up any and all human waste. 

In short: it's underproduced, overpriced, time-consuming, slow-paced, and repetitious. If you like coordinating actions and managing resources to achieve minute steps in progress, this is the game for you.

This s a deep economic game with various paths to victory for which you choose a patron saint. Each gives certain benefits, but also a different set of victory conditions. You expand around cities and the land produces resources, but gets depleted. Each city has a separate map showing the buildings that you add. This is a satisfying game, but managing the many pieces can be a pain. A computer version would make this easier.

RATING: 6
Antiquity is strategic, it's a game to be learned. An initial plan on developing the principality, based on the chosen victory condition, needs to be formed. The first few turns will be mostly solitary optimization exercises until players' spheres of influence collide. Henceforward, the strategic plan needs to be adjusted tactically to account for other players' challenges and hinder them from achieving their goal.

Strategic games are difficult for me. Learning them more often  than not annoys me too much. After one play of Food Chain Magnate, I lost all interest. Getting the right achievements is too important, the valid combos too limited to be compensated by the potential rewards of the ensuing board-based competition. Antiquity is more interesting for me. The initial phase seems more open with the board forming a relevant part of the game from the start. The most serious drawback is the low functionality of the components resulting in excessive manual handling of minimal barely distinguishable pieces.

Prefer to Roads & Boats, as it seems less linear and less "tracked."  I also like that there's conflict of a sort.  After one play and reading some strats, I can see that it's much more of a slash-and-burn race game (as opposed to a careful planning/optimization game) than I would have guessed.  The variable win conditions are very intriguing.  Though my tastes are not a perfect fit for what Splotter makes, I'm glad they're out there doing their thing.

RATING: 8
Kind of an overwhelming experience.  In essence the game is not needlessly complicated, and most of the building actions really make sense with regards to the theme.  There are a lot of moving parts, like the other big Splotter releases.  I have to say that the graphic design on Antiquity is by far the best of any of their games.  From the box cover to the player aid to the chits themselves, everything looks very nice - finally a game that looks like it is made for adults, a game to be treated seriously.  Some of the form may at times overrule function, but even with the huge amount of chits, I don't find Antiquity to be too fiddly or complicated.

I like the theme of the game, even if it does seem very PC, and I enjoy the fact that the game is a struggle for survival, akin to challenging economic games like Age of Steam.  It seems that over time certain moves could become scripted, but the variable setup probably helps alleviate that somewhat.  I know I've only just scratched the surface and I look forward to playing this a lot more.

Antiquity is a full euro, with some interesting divergent victory conditions (no VP scoring!) and basically a double limited space puzzle as your cities get swamped in cemeteries and houses (which are inproductive), while the countryside is filled up with pollution and exhausted soil. It uses worker placement (although it's not in your face), where some workers are stuck in the same place until the surrounding countryside is fully exploited. 

The downside is that it is mostly multi player solo and leads to analysis paralysis. Also, the theme of antiquity is not very well developed, and the fact you are building cathedrals seems like it was first meant to be a medieval game. But it could have been a space game as well. Fun to try, but not eager to play again.

Rating after one play. But what an amazing experience. 

For the first half of the game getting even close to a win condition for any of the saints seemed neigh impossible. Keeping up with famine and pollution seemed insurmountable. But somehow we all figured it out and two players completed their win condition and the 3rd was a turn or two away.

This game is good but it is too fiddly for me to want to play more than a couple of times a year. If there were an online version that would book-keep everything though it would probably be an excellent game (not perfect as the early game is mostly solitaire). I enjoy the resource management and planning aspects of the game, particularly once you have built the pollution reducing building. There can be quite a bit of downtime. I taught some people a different game while waiting for others to think through their turns.

Rating after 1 play.  Complex and strategic.  Rules are straightforward and don't interefere with gameplay. Appreciate variation in victory conditions.  Mild disappointment though by lack of interaction/competition between players until very end.  Gameplay may have limited replayability (can vary tile placement and victory conditions but little other changes).  I had unrealistically high expectations of this game and it fell a little short.

RATING: 8
Astonishingly well-designed, fussy, thinky eurogame. We played three turns to get the rules and then started over; a wise suggestion. 

It's really easy to end up in a fix where you're not making enough food/luxuries/etc. and there's no way to recover. I'd highly recommend getting a granary in the first couple turns, though I don't think you necessarily need three carts; two will do fine. You do need to have a good idea which cathedral you're going to build within the first three turns. 

While this will look at first glance like another perfect information Euro not too different from Caylus or any number of city building games, or maybe even Tempus, don't be fooled. Antiquity has a couple of things that separate it from the pack:

1. The Tetris minigame you end up playing with buildings. Believe me, you can win or lose the game on spatial awareness. Or rather, you can lose the game on spatial awareness.

2. The lack of VPs. No one is necessarily in the lead until suddenly they torpedo their Cathedral, build another, pick a new saint, and win two rounds later. (That's actually not a bad strategy, given some of benefits of different saints.) Picking your own victory condition is a nifty mechanic that can allow you to feel out your opponents before settling into a definite goal.

3. The absolute brutality of the system, in which building the wrong building or the right one at the wrong time can kill you. I can easily imagine losing this game in the first round if you don't spend your wood wisely. There are so many resources to stay on top of, and at times it can be so hard to manage all of them, if you're not careful, you can run out of wood and then, oops! No more building for you! Enjoy the next couple hours of watching your friends finish.

4. For all its putative weight and finickiness, I can imagine finishing a game inside of three hours if you were playing with two other people who knew what they were doing. Compared with comparable strategy games like Civ, it's unusual that such a rich game with so many interesting choices and strategies - and one that's so unforgiving - has a play time that's as short as this. The one game I played to finish took four or five hours, but it *would* take less next time, and besides, that was a lot of meat for four or five hours. 

Nota bene: Definitely better played with people who'd play by gut than the AP-prone.

This is just superb. Play it if you ever have a whisper of a chance, and a long, lazy afternoon to get to know it. Antiquity is good enough that I don't really ever need to play any of the other similarly-themed city-building-type games. They'll just look dull next to this.

After two plays, the jury is still out on one of Splotter's most notable titles.  It shares one of Roads & Boats greatest strengths - a simple ruleset coupled with deep gameplay.  Add in the Tetris-like city building, and this should have easily been rated a 8.5 or higher.   Succumbing to pollution at about the two hour mark tends to suck out much of the fun though.

I like that you can pick your own special victory goal, but you have to do this a bit early and there are definitely some that are much easier than others. 
I think that after 2 plays the game will very much simply be a matter of repeating your same strategy again. 
Many little bits to keep track of.. it would be easier if made into a computer interface or the like, but I highly recommend an in-person play first. It helps you get a feel for the bits and chits. 
The easiest way to win is not to worry so much about expanding but just to buy early the pieces that make your land re-usable.

Very unforgiving game that you must stay ahead of both famine and pollution while maintaining pursuit of your winning objective which is based on the cathedral you build.

RATING: 9
Played once with 3 player. Mechanics are somehow a mix of Princes of Florence and Roads&Boats, which means that it is a very good strategy game without any luck. Lots of difficult decisions to make and mistakes are rewarded without pardon. The theme is transported astonishingly well, creating the feeling of building a medieval civilization, having to provide enough food for the growing society to prevent starving, having to deal with the pollution that mines, farms and fishers as well as the cities leave behind.
During the game you choose the victory conditions from a set of different possibilities by building a cathedral and picking its corresponding saint. This spices up the game even further, since besides managing to improve your own status towards your specific victory conditions, you have to keep an eye on your opponents who might follow a completely different strategy to fulfill their conditions.
All in all a very good game which might even improve with further plays.

RATING: 8
This is a rather brutal game and there is definitely the feeling that it is difficult to tread water and survive much less work toward the victory conditions.  The grinding aspect of taking three steps forward and two steps back gives the game its epic flavor.  The systems are quite ingenious but this is not a game I'm always up for.

Whahoo!  It's priced $190 for a game!  It must be that good and rare! $160 from CoolStuffUnlimited too.  It is an horrible price.  I don't know why a Euro-like game can bid that high.  Anyway, I should go online play with this instead. Note to self: registered and I have downloaded the Chinese rules.

I'll refrain from rating it after only a single online play on which I clearly had no idea what I was doing. Thankfully there's now someone owning it here and so I can try it properly, but until then it is not top priority on my list. This is the third Splotter I tested after Indonesia and The Great Zimbabwe, and up to now I think Indonesia is head and shoulders above the others.

Nail-biter of a Civ game. There's not much interaction here but you won't notice because the game itself is such a beast. Compare this to watered-down faff like Agricola and there's no contest -- even if you lose at this one you actually feel like you've accomplished something.

There's alot going on, and not enough time to do it all. It's one of the best engine building games I've ever played.

Pollution and famine are two of the most interesting mechanics of any game, and force you to balance all the actions you take. 

I'm not so sure how balanced all of the win conditions are, but I am certain that over time we will see that they are more equal than they first appear.

Played again. This game will hurt your brain, but it never feels as long as it is. I have to concede that Larry Levy was right: I don't think you would use Pollution or Famine for a new players first game, but after the first play I wouldn't play without it.

Update: 

Many more plays. Still heavy. Still brain melty. Still a 10.

I used to own the gigantic black box edition, but traded it away cuz I had nowhere to put it... the new 2017 edition will have a more reasonably sized box similar to Caverna. The new edition will also have wooden meeples rather than cubes and wood houses for inns, and black plastic translucent pollution counters. I'm probably the only person in the world who will miss the hundreds of tiny cardboard pollution chits.

This game is so damn hard from a resource management perspective... but I love that.  It's also like playing BLokus or the top of the temple in Cleopatra and the Society of Architects... and I suck at that and find it frustrating.  I know it's an elegent solution in terms of making decisions for intra-city builds costly, but it just makes the game far less enjoyable for me than it would be otherwise.  I'd play and loose a dozen times in a row if it weren't for the puzzle-piece aspect.

This could be a great game, but I had a bad experience with it after one play.  It is a city/civ building game of sorts with a pollution mechanic.  You have to balance growth with pollution.  It is incredibly fiddly but I got into a death spiral in my one play.  And it was zero fun.  I new I was going to lose, and had to play it out.  I suppose that once you really knew what you were doing, you could play optimally and the game would go much faster and would be more fun.  I did not like it, and would much rather play Indonesia.

Ken:
Eagerly anticipated it.  Managed to get an order in.  Received it, punched it, organized it.  Saw that it was going for way more than my purchase price, and couldn't resist the sale.  Game was also quite daunting due to playtime and fiddliness.

Looked, as others report, like a deep and detailed city building/area control game with some abstract elements.  I expect Clash of Cultures and/or Nations will fill the void, and, quite frankly, I could buy both for the price I initially paid for Antiquity.

Would love to actually play it at some point.  No chance of future re-acquisition (unless it somehow goes mass market and I could pick it up on the cheap - which is never going to happen).

Micromanagement of a medieval city. Several options to explore. You need to defeat the game (famine, pollution) first, then the opponents. Scarcely interactive (no war). Very fiddly (hundreds of counters, bookkeeping). Long.

I'm too stupid for this game.

It's a real nightmare. I get the game, but I don't. There is a beautiful mechanic behind this game, but the game is so unforgiving that you can really easily mess up your game and have your cities full of graves and the surrounding landscape all polluted denying any further production or building.

I love and hate this game. I really want to learn to play this, but every game just hurts my brain and soul. Something always dies inside me while playing this. Yes, we laugh when playing, but it's more hysterical or maniacal laughter than of joy.

Added 5/2013. Happy Mother's Day from Del. I had it spread on the kitchen table, sorting and bagging for TWO days (off and on). This gave way too many neighbors and friends the chance to see it and ask to play too, so no shortage of opponents. Our first few plays were similar to Roads & Boats, in that we found there is far more to learn about how the game works than is immediately obvious. I expect this rating to go up over time.

Antiquity is comprised of some familiar(borrowed) mechanics and some unique features. 

The formers are getting resources from lands and constructing buildings with them (reminds me of Catan), buildings with various abilities (of PR), tetris-like building placement (of PotF), etc. Those are themselves not so new, but they are well-interwoven to this big game.

The latters are famine, pollution and saints. They are very unique, and make this game so interesting and challenging.

Famine and pollution choke your cities, produce a hard pressure which can be compared to that of AoS. But they are not unmanageable, and after you survive, then you can run for a victory. They are not only fun, also have messages. When a game ends, totally polluted land and high famine ratio are left behind. Maybe a picture of future-earth...

And another feature is, saints. There are five saints. You should choose one of them during a game play. Then your victory condition is settled, and at the same time, that saint will give you extra ability. So there are five winning conditions, five extra abilities. Each saint requires different strategies. (Well, I've always loved variable victory conditions and variable player powers)

It is mainly a empire-building game, but what really matters is HOW FAST you can fulfill your winning conditions. To go first, you probably have to abandon some needed buildings and take some risk. Or you can be safe with all the security buildings, but result can be that you be late. It is also a interesting choice.

I played it with marginal interactivity, but I think it allows some more interactivity. To fully appreciate it, more plays are needed.

Maybe the best of Splotter.

Fastest of three big Splotter games. With all the pressure of famine and pollution this 2-3 hour game fly. Well, when your cities dies, while other still fight it moves at snail speed, but you should avoid that at all costs. Anyway at such unfortunate moment you can give up and quit without ill consequences to game.

[19.mar.2012] Corrected from 9 to 7, to show that I like Indonesia and R&B better. ( 9 is maximum now I give to modern boardgames)

Multiplayer solitaire.  Must commit to your path to victory early and changing plans later in the game can be a significant handicap.  Elegant game design, very cool system, but the most fiddly game I've ever played.  You should play it once or twice to experience it, but I find Roads and Boats to be better.  Given a block of time suitable for this game, and I'd now rather play most anything else.

After one play - very nice. I really like civ-building games and this is a good one. I really like being able to choose my victory conditions (by choice of patron saint) and the variety of resources to pursue. This rating could actually go up. My only reservations - Not a lot of interaction between the players and the early game is so tight and the consequences for early mistakes so deadly,  there might not be as many viable choices to be made here as appears at first glance. Though I think that the huge range of options in the middle game makes up for this.

7.5 Based on first play. I enjoyed the game experience vey much and although all three of us had different winning objectives we were all within one turn of the winner to finishing ourselves.

However, I feel that the price does not justify the quality of the pieces in the box. The player mat could be separated from the player aid to save table space.
The buildings could be colour coded. The fishery should be hex shaped. The game should come with player screens for the secret part of the turn. The layout of the houses on the player mat should make it easier to read the price of the house from under the cubes you put on the houses in the setup.

Also the game takes considerably more than the advertised 2 hours. Our 3 player game took over 6 hours (we were all newbies but we are not slow players and we understood the rules quite well after the first couple of turns)

build city buildings, send people to board to farm, fish, mine, or explore, or expand.  Produce food, building materials and luxury goods.  Cities produce pollution making polluted areas unproductive.  Famine produces graves inside your city taking up valuable building spaces.

Nice civ building game playable in a reasonable amount of time.  Only possible downside is the fiddliness of all the small counters moving on/off the board.  Graphics on some counters is not very distinct (esp fish vs dye).

Wow - this is a dense game that passes time quickly.  It is a little confusing on who owns what fields or goods near the end.  We played for five hours and I feel like I haven't even come close to scratching the surface on the best strategies.  In my opinion the game seems very solitaire.  Not too much interaction is taking place in the early stages of the game...  I wonder if the area enclosure victory condition might be the easiest to achieve?  Despite the fiddliness of the multitude of counters I enjoyed the game... I found it very refreshing and highly unique. At any rate, I very much look forward to trying this again.

Ok, this one is Fiddly (yes, that's a capital F). 
I've spent way more than an hour punching all the various chits.

You lose terribly if you make the mistake of letting your last wood go. (Yes, I learned the hard way)

And most of the time during gameplay you're muttering "I need more food" and "I don't want all these pollution counters" between cursewords.

It can give you a headache. It's quite A.P.prone.

But it's a great game! Everything seems to work very logical together. Had to get myself this quite expensive game after just one play. Can't wait to play it again.

Probably one of the better games I have had the privilege of playing.. I got pulled in splotter games by Roads and Boats which I have tried desperately to acquire but to no avail (been pre-ordered for the last 4 months) I read up for ages on Antiquity and so badly for it to match up to the hype I had created for it in my head.. My wonderful girlfriend managed to find a copy for me in the US and had it shipped up to me in Canada for Christmas 2012.. I absolutely LOVE the theme, the billions of chits, the mechanics of the game, playing with your own city boards and how you build directly influencing how the game comes to life on the community board.  We have a bit of trouble getting this one to the table as one of our gaming group members was completely buried in graves 5 turns into his first game and refuses to let us bring it back out.. I'll have to keep on it!! It's definitely NOT a forgiving game, but I'd recommend it none the less - its a true gem..

A great design with multiple victory conditions, action selection, resource & building management.  Most beginners will find the game to be challenging & claustrophobic (painful but fun) as the board & their cities continue to fill up with buildings, pollution and tombstones (from famine).  The hundreds of pieces did not bother me & the game isn't as intimidating as it looks once you get a couple of turns under your belt.  Some may be put off by the limited player interaction although some nasty interaction will occur once kingdoms meet up with each other; this is when you can really screw with your opponents by harvesting & polluting the land they've had their eye on.

Very tough game! Fighting the famine and the pollution is really hard work and only after you survive those, you can start to think about winning (but it does get easier when you play more).

Different winning conditions make this game quite interesting. Playing can be hard work, thanks to the hundreds of counters and, especially with new players, bound to take a lot of time. Still, it's a great game. The satisfaction you can get just from surviving the famine is immense.

Suggest.

Sim City: The Renaissance. This game is BRUTAL and unrelenting and requires a kind of micro-management and careful planning that honestly reminds me of a house of cards. I really enjoyed the experience even if my cities were wiped out by famine due to my own poor planning. I guess the lower rating is ultimately because the complexity and the unforgiving nature of it just means it's not something I want to play every weekend. Also, I suspect there are very few people in my regular playgroup who will enjoy this in the way that I do. Still, it really is an exceptional game.

That said however the game develops quickly and completes around the 2 hour mark. It is not complex, but there are lots of things to do and you need to keep an eye on your opponents in the later stages of the game. 
There is not little interaction as each player concentrates on building their "engine" towards their chosen victory condition.
I am not sure that I would want to play with the graves and secondary pollution variants as I think it would turn the game into more of an ordeal instead of an enjoyable experience.
Looking forward to a second game.

Played once, lost hard. The game was fascinating, but for me it was just too much of an exercise in control. I'm not a control freak by nature, and this just made my head hurt after a while. And if you don't play very carefully you end up losing badly in no time. In addition to this, interaction between players is very low, the only interaction being in screwing up the plan of the other guy by careful placement of "trash" tiles, and it played a lot like a solitaire.
Playing once was enough for me, and the money value it had was just too much for what it offered, so it went up on the marketplace.
I can see some kind of people enjoying this game. But not me, thanks.

This is almost a solitaire game till the end when going after victory conditions
A lot of planning is needed to prevent loss by famine and making sure you are never out of wood
The game isn't too long because of the increasing famine level every turn but taxes the brain

RATING: 10
All rise for the greatness that is Antiquity.  Initial thoughts:  This game is ruthless enough to make Age of Steam look like Candy Land, and it's a beast to set up, but it's good.  Subsequent thoughts:  This game has a harsh learning curve but more ruth once you get beyond it, and it's still a beast to set up, but it's GREAT.  The levels of randomness and player interaction are low, but high enough to prevent the emergence of a dominant, game-solving strategy.  Antiquity boasts just about everything I want in a game.

RATING: 7
Extremely fiddly but we all knew where we're getting into.

A good game, excruciating the first turns where you're trying not to be bashed by the game, but at mid way the game starts to feel very procedural when you get your economic engine runing, and lately you can see the end of the game in 3 or 4 turns and just going through the game to get there.

Also feeled a lot multiplayer solitaire, played a three and two players game and never looked, just out of curiosity, to what other players were doing 

A game due to is lenght prone to hit the table two a three times a year.

I wound up liking this a lot more than I thought I would, based on my prior experiences with Splotter games. It really is a computer city building game, adapted to a board. The rules seem very fiddly at first, but once you get in the groove, the complexity lessens as you understand how things interact.

This is one of Michelle's favorite games and I can guarantee that she will beat me at this every time we play... it's only a matter of by how much!

RATING: 10
Love at first sight.

Antiquity offers all I like in games. It is a heavy and beautiful resource management game that as a bonus has an important spatial element, with the map different each time.

It is beautiful in two. It has the right balance between having the possibility to follow your strategies without your opponent messing your plans up, but at the same time there is interaction.

There is a multitude of chits to be managed, but this doesn't disturb me, actually I like to touch and see all those pieces as the game evolves as a story.

Very recommended if you like heavy strategic games as I do.

Potential filled civilization game.  I like the early game pressure to stay above water and find equal enjoyment in the race to the end goal.  I've only played two player games so far but I find the confrontation, both direct and indirect, to provide enough tension to not allow the game to fall into a relaxed mechanical slumber.

A good civ building game. Way too many tokens. This is a game that would do well with a computer implementation, since the regular game, although enjoyable, is bogged down by the mundane task of placing and removing dozens of tiny little tokens. I like the aspect of needing to maintain your growth, but also curtail the waste that you produce. Might be worth more plays, but likely not due to it's length and fiddlyness.

After play two, it seems once you get where tokens go, the game goes much faster. There's a good amount of strategy in this one, but not that much direct interaction, at least not in our games. I've played with four twice, so maybe with fewer players there would be more interaction on the map. I think now, this is my go-to civ game.

First impression (3 players): Basically Antiquity is a very good game. I especially liked how there is no initial victory condition but you have to build a building that gives you one. However for some reason I didn't like my only game as much as I could've. I cannot pinpoint why and I certainly could play another game to see if it is really game's fault and not just a bad day for me.

An excellent city/empire building game, except it doesn't really matter whether the other players are actually at the table.

Good stuff.

Questo gioco è risultato troppo anche per me. Lo dico subito, non mi è piaciuto, suscitando le ire degli amanti dei giochi Splotter. In questo gioco abbiamo la solita, classica, pessima, ergonomia dei loro giochi, 2000 tassellini di dimensioni e icone inadeguati per poterci giocare con piacere, questo aspetto in giochi come Indonesia e Bus li ho anche accettati perché il gioco mi ha restituito gioia nella sua applicazione e nel suo sviluppo. In Antiquity invece non ho provato piacere seppur comprendendone la profondità e lo spessore che ci sta dietro. Il gioco però si è rivelato più faticoso che divertente, un lavoro più che un gioco, sensazioni già provate con giochi come Arkwright e The Great Zimbawe che ho comunque apprezzato ma che effettivamente non ho piacere a rigiocare perché, tra calcoli e tempi morti, non mi divertono. Anche Antiquity si posiziona in questo filone, troppo profondo e complesso per i miei gusti sopratutto per un gioco con questa, a mio avviso minima, interazione. Se avessi tre ore o più di tempo e cercassi un gioc profondo intavolerei un 1830 un Indonesia o un Container.

There's really a lot going on in this game.  I do like the idea of working your land to get resources, but using it up in the process.  However, the whole thing seemed very convoluted, I wonder if it could be streamlined some.  Additionally, the various victory conditions seemed too hard to achieve: even when people's civilizations started to get going, victory was still miles away.  I'm not entirely convinced that the victory conditions are particularly balanced, either.  Also, the bits in this game were too small and too numerous to manipulate easily.

Interesting system, but awfully fiddly. After playing I realized that although it was deep and engaging game it was also exhausting to play this.

In the words of the immortal Bartholomew J. Simpson: ay caramba!

Complex economy building game, with lots of resources and buildings to manage. Pollution and famine make for   huge, sharp sword hanging over your neck during the entire game.

Antiquity also conveys a very clear ecological statement in a fairly catastrophic way. Fail to have a plan to deal with pollution and watch your civilization drawn in its own waste (it happened to both players, in our first game). Good stuff! :P

The player interaction is small in the beginning, but grows as the game progresses, and can become brutal as the players start to fight for territory, resources and places to dump their pollution. 

Luck is almost non existent (the only luck dependent elements that I can think of is the initial player order and the explorer tiles).

The only complaint I have is that the game is fiddly, with a lot of small pieces and very expensive. Even so, this is one of my all time favorites games.

Really enjoyable game despite its fiddly-ness. You're building cities, trying to feed your people and deal with the resulting pollution. I really liked that there are multiple choices for victory conditions, which makes the game really interesting.

Despite really messing up my board on my first play (so that I was not even in contention for most of the game) I really had a lot of fun playing.

While I couldn't spend the money to buy this game, I definitely wouldn't turn down another play of someone else's copy. :)

Intriguing game.  It feels like someone wanted to explore the "tragedy of the commons" in a board game.  While I enjoyed the puzzly aspect of the city board and building functions, the resource-gathering main-board actions were pretty brutal and it was hard to reconcile the two.

It felt a little like someone was trying to replicate a computer sim that had a "zoom in" feature.  I'm not sure I want that sort of double-vision in a boardgame.

That said, I would definitely be willing to try it again.  There was enough substance there to make up for the fact that it felt unsuited to the medium.

This one's quite enjoyable, though it takes a little bit of effort to get the ball rolling (not unlike Roads and Boats).  It's a game where you feel like you start out behind and won't ever catch up.  But that is where the excitement lies:  can you reach your goal before things spin out of control?  The player interaction seems to come to the forefront right when you want it the least, but I see that as a good thing - having to manage your city for the potential interference of the inevitable urban sprawl. The game is quite immersive (as it seems many Splotter games are) and is a lot of fun to play.

25 plays - Really an excellent game. Better with each play. I like the theme, the simplicity of the mechanics combined with the complexity of the game. Each victory gives the feeling of a true accomplishment.

The game is multiplayer solitaire only with beginners. Play it with an experienced player and he will build a city next to yours in a couple of turns. He will use famine and pollution against you, and finally he will asphyxiate you while completing his victory conditions. Not really a peaceful game!

Expensive but really beautiful, and you can play two two-player games separately with the material.

A resource management game that involves careful balance of natural resources vs trying to out-speed the other players to victory. Lots of tiny cardboard bits stacked on other bits, but there's a real joy to that for me. I also enjoy how you remove resources from the board revealing unusable pollution behind, and if you are not careful you can choke yourself to death.

It perhaps could use some more player interaction Only one of the endgame goals really mandates that you have anything to do with the other players. otherwise it's just a semi-race to getting the better placement spots for a second city in the middle.

Two words come to mind after half a play: Underwhelming and Disappointed. This game definately has its supporters as do most Splotter games. I will say I thought it was better than Roads and Boats but that is not sayin much. 

First of all its a brain burner, almost hurts to think. You have to manage everthing carefully or you'll go bust. But that was all that I found good about it. It took an hour to get through the rules! To play properly would have taken anohter 5 or 6 easily. There are many other games I would prefer to play in that time frame. In the end I felt like I was shuffling resources around without feeling much joy in accomplishing my goals. For me there was no fun factor. This game might be a little better as a computer game, since the computer good do all the shuffling around for you and cut down on the fiddliness of the components.

The production was fine for this kind of game. The gameplay is annoying, too much fiddling around with pieces. It takes almost 20 minutes to set up and another 20 to take down and that's only if you have baggies for everything. I'm just glad I didn't shell out the ridiculous $120 to try this game. Mind you, those that did appear to be happy with it so that's good for them.

Had a lot of the things I love in a game: tile laying, puzzling out combinations (during building), construction, economics. But it lacked on the interaction front - seemed like 80% of the game is solitaire. Also, far too fiddly for the amount of game fun payback. I finally opted to sell it and get three other games for the money.

1 3-player trial game. An over-long parallel solitaire resource management game with lots of 1/2" counter fiddling. Having a clear strategy from the outset is essential and the ability to manipulate the available options to execute a strategy will only come with gaming experience (not having that strategy in hand will doom the player to several hours of hopeless piece shuffling). However, I don't believe I'm willing to take that time since there are other (shorter) games of this ilk (even my less than favorite Puerto Rico) that I'd rather play.

Played once as a 4-player game.  After about 5 turns, 3 of us (playing for the first time) realised that we would perish by famine in the next 1 or 2 turns.  So, although it appears to only rate a 5 on this play, I can see the potential for this to be a very good game (7 or 8), once you get to realise what needs to be done to avoid being swamped by graveyards and pollution.  Next time ...

Check out the Rules and Player Aid pdfs (dated 2004-10-28) in Files above. It certainly helps to be able to read through these.  Also, try out the Java program version (dated 2008-05-29) by Ponton in Files above.  This is a very good substitute while we wait for version 3 to be published by Splotter.  Re-rated after a couple of goes at this Java program.

This game is unforgiving and how. With every passing round it seems you are dying bit by bit and this thing will never work.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit. Its very different from most games in that you have a hex map to build your cities and resource gathering. You compete with other people for space on that map. You build structures in your own cities on a square map that give you bonuses during play. I think all elements of the play and game are very nice. The only problem it has is that you have a ton of counters to have to fiddle with during the game. It very much feels like a computer game while you are playing.

A maga nemében nagyon zseniális játék. Valahonnan az alapoktól indul és tök jól fejlődik, de piszkosul nehéz, egy hiba és elvágtad magad. Nehéz volt elsőre átlátni. Illetve a logisztikája, az átláthatósága a 0 hoz tendál! :) mindemellett piszkos jó agytorna. 4 órás volt, 3,5 óra csendben zajlott le. Sikerült nyernem., de igen komolyan mefizzadtam!

RATING: 6.5
The upside:
-This one burns. A lot of little things to do/pay attention/avoid that amount to a gigantic experience of boardgaming and, to someone new to the game like myself, suffering.
-Multiple types of resources, buildings and victory conditions are always a plus if done right.
-How it looks...

The downside:
-...how it plays. It's like they tried to make your plays as hard as it was deciding them. Fiddly beyond all recognition.
-Steep learning curve. 
-Pricy.

With only a couple two player games in and a brief smattering of internet play, my opinion is inexperienced.   So far I really like it.  Its unforgiving to new players and not the easiest game to introduce and its fiddly and takes up a big table with even a couple players.
The civilization engines feel similar to roads and boats, action selection resembls Agricola.  Its very interesting and I think will become one of my favorites.

RATING: 6
I'd hoped this would be as good as Roads and Boats, but unfortunately I don't think it is. It has a similar level of complexity, but it lacks the networking element. The bits and hexes are very small and require a lot of handling; the "zone of control" notion is just complex enough to be difficult to see on the crowded, cluttered board; the rules are detailed and complex and can be difficult to keep straight. All of this would be more forgiveable if the game were less dry. Hey, I [i]like[/i] complex Euros, but Antiquity just felt too much like work. I'd like to give it a 7, but it doesn't quite make the grade. I give it a 6.

Heavy ressource conversion economic game. Antiquity is quite brutal, since most actions deplete your land and the "feeding your people" ist present throughout the game. I  really enjoyed the seed and harvest mechanisms (similarities to Argicola or Loyang) as this is combined with the modular map.

This game is quite heavy, since during your first play you simply try to get your economy going. But this is not how to win the game. The game has several win conditions from which you have to pick one from the start. In essence, you have much less guidance than in more modern games.

The game is quite fiddly. I was lucky to play a self-made copy (not by me), with tokens for the different resources and commodities. Also the map was very well colored. I do not want to imagine how Antiquity plays with the original brownish paper chits.

DEEP AND AMAZING GAME FOR HIGHLY EXPERIENCED GAMING MASOCHISTS 
Never mind your opponents this game will kick your ass by itself.  [FIRST PLAY] We skipped the training wheels and went straight in with famine and pollution.  This game is every bit as punishing on Noobs as everyone says - its like getting tossed into the deep end of the pool so you can drown first - maybe you will learn to swim in your next life.  Lots of bits and chits to be moved around make this game the poster child for the BGG definition of fiddly.  BUT - fantastic game I'm really looking forward to my next play.  I expect my rating to increase with subsequent plays.  [PURCHASE] Punched the myriad cardboard chits, discovered the wooden cubes were missing.  Shot an email to Funagain who promptly responded that they would ship the same day - and they did - game now complete.

Innovative system. The game is hugely AP-prone. You need to plan many many turns ahead. The rules are not complex but every decision dramatically affects the other and there is a high chance you mess up something early on in the game. I could try this again but not even dream about winning the game. I just fear that this game is too calculative in the long run since there is very little interaction between the players early on in the game.

RATING: 7
This is a very strange, but rather interesting game, which I've now played 3 part-games of, but never finished - it just seems to take so long to reach a stage where you can be in a position to reach your victory condition. The game is so punishing - at least for a newbie - that you seem to spend most of your time just trying to avoid disaster, and unable to actually move forward. It is really interesting though, and a game I would definitely like to play more of, if not all the time. Perhaps the most interesting feature of this game is that you get to choose your own win condition (and special power to go with it), not at the start of the game but at a point of your own choosing later on.

Antiquity has a lot of well-balanced mechanisms: civ planning, engine-building, resource management and area control without the direct conflict or war. Extremely fiddly but deep and strategic.  

Almost perfect information (unexplored resources are mostly unknown) with random setup.  Get that Cathedral built and use the bonuses but don't be afraid to raze and rebuild either.  This is an excellent game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
:) Tense puzzle to manage workers, resources, building space, pollution, ...

:) Challenging and rewarding core mechanics

:) The game has a strong feeling of growth: you start out small, but when you play your cards right, after a couple of turns you reap the benefits

:soblue: The components are extremely underproduced, in a way that is almost offensive. About 700 tiny tiles which all look more or less the same, uncorrect calibration of the prints on punchboards, absent player screens, suboptimal player aids, thin cardboard. This game is not at all produced to todays standards, especially not for the price tag it carries.

:soblue: Player elimination is a real risk in this game, which can be problematic given its long game length.

:soblue: It is perfectly possible for one or more players to get 'stuck' pretty early in the game, making it impossible for them to get back into the game. In that way the game is highly unforgiving.

This game isn't at all as fiddly as it appears. The rules are concise and well written, and if it weren't for the need to manipulate tiny counters, play would zip along. Fascinating and brain burning.

Based only on 2-player games, would love to try to play with 3 or 4. How tight, but what a great game!

UPDATE:
Finally it got played with four players the other day. Major difference: FAMINE. Even if only two out of four players start exploring a little, famine level goes up much faster and soon we ran out of graves. Still a GREAT game!

UPDATE: The last two (3p) games I've played with Santa Maria and both times I went into a tiebreaker for the victory. One win and one loss...

RATING: 8
Engrossing and oppressive. Finally, something that actually feels like a civ-building game, as though you are part of a grander scale, and evokes the hardship and toil that your little medieval society experiences as it struggles to stay stable. I appreciate very much how it is not always clear how to attain your win condition, and how scarce resources are in general. This forces you to be decisive at risk of triggering the utter collapse of your civilization. Interestingly enough, I was able to bounce back from a mistake and reign in a win with the 'surrounding' saint, but this was a 2p game. I strongly doubt it would be so easy at full player count, but I do wish to try.

Antiquity plays unlike any other game I have ever tried (comparisons to Myrmes aren't as direct as they were claimed to be, though Alban Viard's small city is touted as a love letter to Antiquity). Either way, I really enjoyed my first play, fiddly-ness be damned.

This has so many qualities that fit my personal preferences: lots of little bits, a geographic map, empire building, resource management, development over time -- a civ game.  So far my "foolproof strategies" keep shooting themselves in the foot, but it's starting to feel like there are a certain set of things you should always do consistently in your first few rounds.  Otherwise you'll be eaten alive by pollution and overpopulation.  A fun -- but not necessarily relaxing -- game.

I had no problem ordering directly from Splotter, but it took about three months to get here (that's AFTER the ship date) -- and then even two months longer to show up on my credit card bill.

RATING: 10
This game rocks!  Imagine combining Settlers of Catan with any game that puts workers on buildings - then put that game on steroids.  Your goal is ostensibly to build up a civilization through luring workers, harvesting goods and building buildings.  What you weren't counting on is that your people get hungry and your land gets polluted, so you have to mitigate that as well so that your cities don't get completely clogged with graves.  The coolest part, in my opinion?  You get to choose how you want to try and win (and get a different bonus ability depending on your choice).  So, you can win by building all the different kinds of buildings, luring 20 workers, stockpiling a ton of goods or encroaching on an opponent's territory - or, if you're feeling really ambitious, get all the possible bonuses with the caveat that you'll need to "win" twice at the same time before anyone else wins once.  Evil.  But cool.

Remarkably good as a solitaire puzzle too.

After playing this more and more I have to give it a 10. I just don't see anything wrong with it. 

Fun civ/economic/expansion euro. I like the way the game plays out from such a modest economy. I really disliked the art originally, but it's growing on me. It fits the period, its just a little drab. The fact that they don't include screens with this game is pretty pathetic, but whatever. The game itself is really pretty brilliant. The game blends a euro management game with a theme to mechanic interaction that really works. This game is not afraid to kick you when you are down, and experience will really help, but its also really fun and fast moving with almost no down time.

My first attempt at Antiquity was two player and we both died without being able to build a second city and it's been in my top 10 ever since.  I love how you are constantly competing against the game, and trying to keep pollution and graves under control, while the other players can screw up everything in one turn.  This game has reinforced my belief that it is better to buy 1 expensive and great game than several less expensive mediocre ones.

RATING: 9
A great, deep Euro, with something of a paper-thin theme, but a solid enough mechanism base to make this unimportant. The game is fairly epic in feel, but plays in a reasonable evening or afternoon slot.

Different victory conditions are implemented very well, and the pollution mechanism is unique and very interesting, forcing hard decisions turn-by-turn. Interaction betweens players is facinating - with a whole host of indirect interactions allowing for a game built on conflict without direct war ever being possible.

The completely unforgiving nature of the beast is also a solid plus in my book - making this a game where decisions really do matter, but pushing it more towards a two-player game to avoid the de-facto elimination of players. 

My only complaint would be with how fiddly the darn thing is, which can lead to frustration and even an entire game being spoiled by a knock to the table - if there were a better way to play than by balencing up to three counters and a cube in a small hex, then it would probably be a 10, but heh - I'll cope.

RATING: 10


My fave complex euro! love that the game is trying to kill me, a la Agricola on speed. A lot of info up front, so hard to teach, but it all hangs together delightfully.

I love how the map you get subtly dictates your opening, and even your patron saint. THe theme feels omnipresent, it never feels gamey. It's near perfect for me. The competition being all map based, as opposed to allowable actions based (e.g. I already took the 'build minor improvement' option, so you can't), is genius, it makes the competition much more organic and thematic. 

I learned when I was dunk, and it was terrifying--I was trying not to let down this complex gamer guy I had just met and really liked, but none of the bits to this masterpiece would stick into my head, they kept slipping on the wine...I near had a panic attack, I was trying so hard to impress the guy through my stupor. It went fine, and we became friends eventually, but the reading rules to this game always gives me some heart palpitations, just from associative memory...

It is with good reason that this is considered one of the fiddliest games ever. So many little bits! Still, this is highly enjoyable if you're into resource management and development type games. It reminds me of playing a real time strategy civ game where you send your laborers out to chop wood and farm and mine. Very well done map with different terrain types for producing the resources. But be prepared for laborious counter manipulation.

In many ways this feels like Agricola XXL. You're not building your farm, but city(ies), you're not feeding your family, but oh my, there's famine and the pollution, God!, the pollution covering everything you touch. And graves of dead people piling up space in your architectural utopia (made by clever use of tetris skills). And the game last at least twice as long. 

The main characteristic that makes both games similar is 
a) theme implementation with resource management worker placement optimisation, 
b) strong restrains of the game which create a focused gameplay. 

Thing is: Antiquity is not that hard to play. Oh, hard to survive, but not to play. As it will always be obvious what your priorities should be (getting to them is a pain, but you're 100% sure what your biggest problem at the moment is). I think what I liked the most was the feeling of camaraderie that happened during the game. We had zero interaction, but we all felt the pain of one another. As for friendliness and rules - the player boards/sheets help wonderfully with the task. 

And it's hard for me to say the game has a narrative. It had, it has, yet I didn't feel proud of building 3 cities and the buildings and all the stuff. No, I felt proud of surviving, of making this far. It's the constant [i]"oh damn! Damn, damn, damn! Shit! Oh, crap."[/i] You are all the time trying to juggle your puny resources and come with a solution. There's no pleasure in building, it's pure necessity. [i]We need to build this right now or we're dead. Whee, we made it, uhm, uh oh. Look like we created some new problems.[/i] 
It's a game of crisis management and every solution creates more crisis. The theme is really about ecology (of sorts) and you quickly understand why people were so religious in the middle ages.

About the visuals. Adore it, simple, yet functional. Colour palette is narrow, but the game isn't that fast - you have time to read the map and see what's what. It clearly evokes the feeling of historical theme and is as immersive as it needs to be. It's about the things you connect in your mind, like when reading a book. No complaints there. I did have complaints about people not playing asking questions [i]"is this home made?", "90 euros for this?"[/i]. Sigh. 

Rating reflects the desire to play again. I don't see it as something to be played often and clearly not something to play with over competitive human calculators. Taking things slowly and enjoying still being alive is what matters. 

P.S: I liked it. It's my highest rated worker placement MPS game. Visuals are great. It's just as high of a rating that I can give to a game of this type.

RATING: 5
Not fully sure what I think yet - been trying it online and am probably finding it more frustrating than fun - you basically have to plan out your entire game , down to what bits you are going to take each turn, to tailor for what your win goal is and if you stray from it, you lose, probably not long into the game. Although I can absolutely appreciate the intricacy of the design, I don't know if I can go so far as to actually call it fun.

Nagy várakozással ültem le a szerzőpáros korábbi játékához. Az Indonesia lenyűgözött. Ez kevésbé, de szintén nagyon jó, komoly játék. A gazdálkodós, épületépítős társasról van szó. A játékosok fejlesztik a városaikat, amikből a város külterületein levő hegyekbe, tavakhoz és mezőkhöz küldhetik el embereiket dolgozni. Körönként tudnak a dolgozók egy-egy anyagot begyűjteni így elég szűkösség van a megtermelt dolgok terén, hasonlóan mint a beépíthető városi területekben és dolgozó emberekben. Elsőre kicsit nehéznek tűnő lehet az épületeket és funkcióikat átlátni, de másodikra szerintem ez könnyedén menne. Nagyon érdekes, hogy a katedrális megépítésével tudnak a játékosok győzelmi célt választani, ami lehet különböző is. Így teljesen más stratégiák is összecsaphatnak, de érdekes lehet ugyanazon célért folyó küzdelem is. Összességében tökéletesen működik a játék. Bajom azzal a holt idővel van, ami az egyes jelölők átlátását és lerakását teszi ki. Nem túl átlátható a terület, a jelölők sajnos nem túl jól megkülönböztethetők és nagyon aprók. Az Indonesia mindenképp közelebb áll hozzám, de bátran ajánlom ezt a játékot is minden gémernek.

A sophisticated, and very classy, resource management game. Highly components-intensive (almost on par with monster wargames, in terms of amount of punching) and probably requiring a longish play-time to any newbie. Components have a very distinctive, archaic feel, that matches gameplay very tightly. 

As a minor complaint, while this game is a simulation (with surprisingly intuitive, smooth and easily remembered rules), and hence thematic in a sense, its historicity is highly questionable (such as, the notion that advances in farming might come from a "biology" faculty residing in the city sounds much more modern than intended to me, the notion of exploration is questionable, and so on...)

Finally, despite its relative simplicity in terms of general rules (although mastering the various ways of achieving something is fiddly due to the number of building special abilities), this is arguably the most daunting game to the newcomer in my collection, in that it does not have any inbuilt mechanics to channel the players efforts towards a conclusion. I could imagine a game of newbies ending in everybody's defeat if they don't get enough production in early enough and start getting swamped with graves!

Woah, what a massive game.  This game requires a lot of mental energy, for some it may just be too much work.  There is so much going on here, but somehow it all hangs together.  There is a great sense of play balance as in the begining you are up against the game system itself and as soon as it seems you are ahead of the curve players are suddenly at each other's throats.  Every turn there is so much that should be done, yet so often you put in a position to determine what absolutely needs to be done and perform as much triage as possible against the overwhelming waves of polution and famine.  

Once you get into a death spiral it is rough trying to get out, but it is possible. Man those graves fill up quickly. In my last game I was at deaths door, and came back to being a turn away from winning at the end of the game.  For me, the joy in cleaning up your empire is at about the same level as going into the black in Age of Steam.  

Magic Realm taught me how to break down games so that set up isn't too big of a hassle. There are a lot of chits in this box.  It took over an hour just to punch and sort everything...

I think that the best description that I can come up with to describe playing this is that the game feels like someone is trying to stab you in the guts, but if you build enough protection the knife kind of tickles.

Usually when someone describes a game as "unforgiving" it means that a careless noob move will give your opponents a lasting edge. I have never seen a game, though, that will so cheerfully allow you to bury yourself, even playing solitaire. I highly recommend playing first using the excellent Java hotseat program; don't engage any human opponents until you feel confident that you can win against a friendly opponent that you control.

I love civ/empire building games, and this is a great one. It is unique and strategic with excellent victory condition implementation. The empire building progression pacing is just right.

Fiddly? Maybe in a good fiddly way. You have to manipulate counters, but to me, that is fun. This is not fiddly in terms of trying to remember tricky rules, or performing meaningless tasks to accomplish minute actions. The rules are streamlined and quickly disappear into the background while the tactics and strategy come to the forefront.

Too long? In my experience, this is actually a quick empire building game, relatively speaking. We never hesitate to start a game if we have a just a few free hours.

It came shrinkwrapped. Many of the smallest counters were loose in the box, but nothing was missing. The printing on both sides of the counters matches up fine in my set.

The rules are short, concise, and reasonably complete, with only one or two very minor typos. The few rules questions I had were ably answered in the FAQ here on BGG.

And the antique style of the artwork makes you even less picky about small misuniformities and blemishes--a good thing.

I could wish the smallest counters were a little bigger, as I think they may be a little awkward to see well and to manipulate, but other than that I am very pleased with this game.

This game can be very punishing to newbies. I suggest playing with the full rules, but only playing four turns, and then starting over again and play to the finish.

Really awesome stuff here. The components have a cool, aged feel, and I actually like how they look although others complain about the lack of flashiness. The gameplay is pretty quick and I like how there are a variety of paths to victory. I like how all the various components interact as far as the resources you can acquire with the buildings you can build. It just seems that you have a bunch of options and the tension of the race to obtain them makes for a rich and engrossing gaming experience. I think I actually like this more than Roads and Boats due to the varied paths to victory.

Really liked the pacing and the explosive amounts of strategies to victory.  Also love the secrecy/reward for building your cathedral late or early.

Super pumped to play it more.

I do really enjoy this game, but I hate how fiddly it is.  I usually play it once a year.  If there was a computer version that took care of all the chits, that would be wonderful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
BITS! Lots and lots of BITS!

This is one VERY fiddly game -- it would be great if someone implemented an online version! There are so many chits, and having to stack them on top of each other and work your way down, and they are relatively small ... all means that you are bound to spend some time during the game fixing the stacks, especially if you have big fat fingers! 

Nevertheless, the game is worth the effort! It is a fun logistical challenge trying to figure out how to best reach your goals while competing with others for board space and access to resources. Of course, you have to deal with the game itself before really even considering your opponents -- the need for food just to survive ramps up pretty quickly! You must ensure you have the food and resources you want when you need them. Since both gathering and using resources require using workers, and resource-gathering can tie up a worker for several turns, you have to plan many turns in advance -- not for everyone, but if you're up for a challenge this game is definitely worth trying!

I would likely rate this higher, if only it weren't so damn fiddly!

Works well with two players and I don't mind the solitaire aspect EXCEPT-you can almost program your first several moves since there are very few random elements until you start encroaching on each other's land.  The designers obviously invested a great deal of time making and playtesting this game.  It's good but doesn't fall into the great game category where you want to play again and again.

This game is not for the feint of heart.  It is a heavy amalgam of civilization building, resource management, area control, and spacial placement.

The game is very, very thinky, fiddly, and difficult much like other Splotter titles.  It will melt your brain and is so dry it will give you cotton mouth.  But if you like a challenging experience it is definitely worth checking out.

Now the game is really all about the design.  Pass that and it is going to turn a little ugly.  The box is humongous, way larger than it needs to be making it unwieldy and difficult to store.  The colors are muted and sleep-inducing.  There are millions of chits the size of a fingernail just begging to be lost or devoured by a pet or toddler.  And everything is printed poorly with the borders going off the edge of the chits.

Having played 2 Splotter games now I wonder how they can justify the price tag on the backs of such sub-standard quality.

"We will reprint Antiquity this year with some significant updates to the materials, including:
- We are changing the box; dimensions will be the same as the standard Splotter box, but 50% deeper to fit all the materials. The picture still shows the old box!
- The wooden pieces, which were simple cubes in past editions, have been redesigned to fit the theme (and yes, we'll check them for size!)
- There will be easy-to-handle plastic chits for pollution instead of cardboard tokens
- Some of the discovery tokens which were hard to distinguish have been recoloured"

There's something strange about this game. I think the game is very good but I don't like playing it that much.So this rate is for the game itself and not based on the BGG rating system.

edit #1: I prefer the 2 player version. It's much better.

edit #2: Played several times more with 2 players it completely grabed my attention. Very good game. It's a bit too fiddly though.

Astonishingly vicious and unforgiving game. Fairly simple, generic city-building mechanisms livened up by the designers' terrible cruelty. The game is stacked against you and every turn is a struggle to even survive.

I'm starting to get the feeling that the overriding design aesthetic of the big Splotter games is "cynicism": if you're not having your hard-built companies taken away from you or ruining the economy for private gain, you're just trying to run a few farms and finding your workers dead and your land choked with pollution. It's quite refreshing, really.

Like Indonesia, loses points for being so fiddly -- it's possible for every hex within reach to have tokens stacked on it.

Update - Played a few more times.  With experiened players this game is playing much more rapidly.  One of the traps of this game is the experiential element.  It's fun to play and easy to forget you need to be trying to win. 

The simple struggle to stay "alive" can be daunting. And in and of itself can consume your plans. Meaning you keep treading water as the water gets colder.  So if you fall behind, you can implode. 


Update - Still maintaining a high rating. Simply put this is a fiddly mess that is definately worth the effort.  I don't know of many game systems that can swallow up a player. But I've seen it. Optimizers will absolutely love this game.  Many people claim thay have stumbled upon THE winning strategy, only to lose every time.  



I really like this game, but it takes forever.  IMHO there is no way a four player game could ever be played in under 3 hours, but I don't mind.  I really like the way the first 2/3 of the game is basically solitaire and the endgame is has some interaction, but not a screw your neighbor type game.  Seems like you surely want to chose the cathedral for storage, but I'm not sure due to lack of experience. I really like the pick your own victory conditions, it makes for a diverse gaming experience.

A superb city-building game.

In essence, the game is about harvesting the natural resources of the area around your cities to develop your cities while managing pollution and famine. The game objectives can vary between players (you each choose your own objective). As the game progresses, player's "spheres of influence" start to encroach on each other, resulting in competition for land and resources. Aggressive players will encroach very quickly, so you can't afford to ignore what everyone else is doing.

Seems to work equally well for 2, 3 or 4 players. This is one of those games where it's best to organise the bits to give each player their own "bank". This speeds up setup & playtime enormously.

The manual is excellent - getting to grips with the tasks ahead of you, and formulating some kind of strategy seems straightforward. Developing strategies to challenge for victory (& how to manage various aspects of gameplay) is satisfyingly thought provoking.

Nice first impression. A bit fiddly to say the least, and a bit longer that I would have hoped for. It is largely non-confrontational. But the game itself is fairly solid and not too chaotic. I would certainly play again, but not a game I would want to purchase. Certainly not at the price tag put up for most Splotter Spellen games.

Highly impressive worker-placement Euro. It's a bit of a mammoth and quite unlike most other games in this overcrowded genre despite it's Italy in the Middle-Ages theme. The game's publisher Splotter Spellen has a history of producing great games with beautiful retro style components (no over-produced plastic here) and Antiquity is no exception. The aim is to develop a variety of buildings within an increasing number of cities by sending out workers to exploit the surrounding countryside. Victory conditions vary greatly depending on which of the five types of cathedral you decide on building and because of this the strategy you employ can differ enormously from game to game. Each action you take seems so important and you really can't afford to waste opportunities to obtain resources or to over-produce a certain type of resource thereby taking one of your workers out of commission for too long. It's pretty tight too which makes it highly unlikely that a runaway leader will emerge. A truly engrossing game.

This game system is sheer brutality. Makes Agricola look like it was designed by Walt Disney.

I'm not the biggest fan of games where the game itself is a as much (or more) of an opponent than the other people at the table. It means you have spend several games figuring out how to operate in the system before you can even worry about how to deal with your opponents.

I very much enjoyed Antiquity, despite the fact that the game obviously hated me.  It was a brutal struggle for survival trying to keep ahead of the famine, let alone working toward a victory condition.

The fact that the players can choose the victory condition is kind of neat, and the way the game seems so fluid in how it moves out from the starting cities to use up all the resources of the neighboring countryside.  

Excellent game, can't wait to get this one back to the table.  Not sure about the replayability since there really is very little randomness, but for now I like it.  Rating may go up or down after more plays.

I picked up 'Antiquity' for my wife, because, as an artist, she liked how the game looked. Yet, I am the one who ended up loving this deep unforgiving civ-game that can feel as spatially tactical as a wargame.  'Antiquity' features minimal (virtually absent) luck, and seemingly endless strategic depth.  Overall, the game is immensely replayable largely due to its varied and asymmetric victory conditions, each tied to patronage of a particular Saint.  Depending on the temperament of the players and which Saints are chosen as patrons, the style of play that emerges can run the gamut from solo-optimization to directly harassing.  There is no combat, but one Saint features an implicitly military objective for victory.  

Like many Splotter games, this design somehow conveys a thematic sense of mischief, perhaps a commentary on the very idea of religo-civil expansion: amidst all of these varied goals, you inevitably will find yourself choking on your own plans to avoid famine, and the question almost boils down to who will be the last to either suffocate or starve.  Ha ha!   

Of course, it's worth repeating that the game is visually sumptuous spread out on a table.  Like its cousin 'Roads and Boats', 'Antiquity' uses no cards and no dice.  Gameplay is organized around a nested set of beautiful maps (Tetris-like shapes of buildings which in turn occupy city grids which are nested inside the shared landscape), and a menu of actions that allow players to mobilize a diverse variety of resource-generating elements onto those maps.  Actions are quasi-simultaneous, which eliminates significant downtime.  

Goals tend to remain stable throughout the game but shift in priority as a full-scale tragedy of the commons plays out on the shared landscape.  One must: navigate the constraints of public and private map spaces; optimize resource deployment; look for tactical opportunities to box opponents in or cut them off.  As an additional strategic layer, it is also possible, through the clever construction of one's own city, to switch patronage from one Saint to another.  For this and other reasons, it is crucial to pay close attention to what other players are doing, even if they appear to be doing it some distance away, lest you find that that olive-cultivating community you've been peaceably trading with is suddenly threatening to surround your city zone.

Fiddly you say? Fiddly nothin'.  A spatially organized civilization game that plays out on a set of nested maps SHOULD be fiddly to a degree.  Again, ask the war gamers.  
  
This is one of only a handful of games in my collection that I can imagine playing for a lifetime.

This one is long with lots of fidly bits you have to manipulate each round. Much like Roads and Boats, you start the game doing a lot at the same time, and only dealing with turn order later in the game (making the game even longer). It was fun, but not 6 hours fun.

I really want to find the time to get this to the table again to wrap my mind all the way around it.  The first time I played, we stalled out a bit, and we eventually called the game when we realized that none of us was anywhere close to reaching a victory condition after a couple of hours of playtime.  However, I really liked the game.  I don't mind (and even enjoy) fiddlyness, and this game has that by the bucket full.

One play, 4-player, with pollution & famine.  We called the game after 4 hours, as it appeared I was about to be eliminated, and the other players were still a long way from winning.  And we had run out of graves an hour before that.

My opinion of the game is nicely summed by PaulGrogan:  "Its a computer resource management game transferred to a boardgame. Not much player interaction, can be a bit fiddly. Still not even sure if there is much of a game in this."  I even said to one of the players, "I'm just not sure it really works as a _game_."  And it seems more than a bit fiddly to me, this is just out-and-out fiddly.

Update: Played again last night, and I'm not sure if it's because things clicked, or just because I played with a different group, but I quite liked it.  I already ordered it and look forward to playing again soon!

Really a great game.  Unfortunately a little complex to teach, although not that complex to play.  One of those that really looks like more is going on then there is.  The one real downfall to this game is there are so many chits.  I mean there are a ton, and you're stacking chits on other chits, and it's just crazy.  Now all of that being said, a really really good resource/city building/quasi worker placement game.  I rate it lower b/c of all of the chits makes it manually intensive and a potential table bump can really mess things up.

Yes, it is extremely fiddly. Yes, it's all about optimisation. Yes, I should not like it. But hey, I do! It's with ease the best Splotter game I have so far played. It's like you threw Puerto Rico and - obviously - The princes of florence into the cauldron along with an essence of highly concentrated "brainyness", mix well, chant the magical verse and out comes a wonderful civ-/culture-building game. Out comes: Antiquity!
The magic in it actually is that everything, just Everything, makes perfect sense (except for you might ask why one would need a ministry of forced labor and why this should be a building) However I fear it won't see much play since even our 2player-session lasted for about 5 hours (rule explanation included) And the rules btw are quite easy to grasp, because for one they are actually quite simple and for another the step by step appproach of the rulebook nicely guides you through. However, to handle the game in progress is quite a challenge. If you are looking for a game that is on the upper scale of "brainy", this is where to go.

An multiple-path efficiency engine type game with a combination of stylised economics, city/tech buildling and worker placement that works really well together and is fun to play.

A bit long and some of the chit-fiddling can be a tiny bit tedious but the vast majority of it can be done while other people are working also, so it doesn't hold the game up. The board presentation is terrific, the aged chit and tile graphic design work amazingly well.

It's interesting to watch polluted areas gradually spread to cover the whole board over the course of the game.

Here's a game that I can really go nuts for. There's a lot of back and forth in the game, with lots and lots and lots of fiddly little counters to go on and off the board, but that's about the only complaint that I have. Civilization building is fun, the pieces are stylisticly unique, and the game is pretty engaging. Would like to play again soon.

2 plays with 4 players so far.  This game might be a higher rated game but as I've thought about our plays over the past couple weeks I realize that this is a long game.  It's not going to speed up much from our 2nd game because we really did keep our heads down and focused.  2nd game everyone had a strategy they were trying to make work and stayed the course of that strategy as best they could while the game systematically worked to make us self-eliminate ourselves.  Given all this...I think there are other games out there that take this amount of time and dedication that I might be drawn to. I DO want to play and I really enjoyed myself in this game but at the same time I guess I wish for maybe a little MORE player interaction in this one.  This only seems to come about in the late game but then again any more would probably add to mechanics and length! A good game that I want to play again every once in awhile but as I think back it seems like it is more of a solo/race game.  

I'm up to 5 games of this one now and I feel differently from above but at the same time not at all differently. See it's a long game and doesn't get shorter with further plays. Which is why after years of it being in our group I've only played it 5 times. It just doesn't see the table much and that's OK. It's a superb game for what it does and I love playing it. I get excited when we work up a day/time to play it and I love playing every time.

This was my first time playing a Splotter game face-to-face (with Bus being the only other Splotter game I've played but that was online at SpielByWeb), and I was certainly amazed by the number of chits in the game. The sheer quantity of components was overwhelming, and now I can begin to understand why Splotter games like this are so expensive. Considering the price, I don't think I'm going to actually end up purchasing Antiquity even though I did enjoy the game. None of us had played before and we actually managed to finish in about four hours, which was surprising (although the rules do suggest that the game can be played in two hours by experienced players, but I'm not sure if I believe that). This is not an easy game to explain, so I recommend reading the rules if you're interested in getting a better understanding of the game (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=7224). I will start out by saying that I did not think these rules were written particularly well. They seemed very much like someone jotting down whatever occurred to them about the game in no particular order or structure. Sure the rules are organized by the ten phases of a turn, but within those sections the rules simply mention a building or an action and say what that does and then move along to another action, broken down into separate paragraphs that aren't linked in any way or in any understandable order. I think that the rules could be re-written to be much better by clearly listing each of the buildings, including the cost and ability, and then providing a brief summary of each phase to convey what players will be doing in each phase. That being said, the game itself was surprisingly simple to understand considering the morass of the rules. This is not to say that this is an easy game that you should break out with new players, far from it, but just to say that four experienced gamers should be able to slog their way through this game without too many rules questions. The game itself is brutal as it continuously punishes you by forcing you to add graves to your city and pollution in the surrounding countryside, making it very difficult to collect the necessary resources and build the necessary buildings. Moreover, there are so many different things you want to accomplish on each turn that it is extremely agonizing deciding what to prioritize. I will say that the game is significantly improved by the fact that most of the gameplay can be performed simultaneously. As long as you trust each player to do their actions correctly, all four players can do most of each turn at the same time without waiting for everyone else, at least until the end of the game when your civilizations begin to encroach on each other. In addition to the major advantage of simultaneous play, one of the other notable good things about this game are the four different winning conditions. Players are allowed to select a "patron saint" when they build a Cathedral in their city, and their choice dictates both the advantage they receive from that saint and the condition they must satisfy in order to win the game. The four wining conditions are: achieving a certain population size, constructing every possible building, enclosing an opponent, or collecting three of each resource.  It was frustrating that I satisfied the winning conditions on one turn but didn't have the right patron saint to win, and when I ultimately was able to switch patron saints I no longer satisfied the winning conditions. However, I enjoyed the four hours of the game more than enough to make up for this mistake in the end. It did seem like the winning conditions might not be balanced since it seemed much easier to build each of the possible buildings than the other three winning conditions, but I'd definitely have to play more to be able to evaluate the balance better. I do like that there are four different goals and players can shape how they play the game based on which goal they choose. Antiquity is certainly a daunting game with over 500 chits to punch out, sort, and keep straight, but it's engaging and rewards the effort if you can get past the rules and jump into the game.

First off, let's just say it. Antiquity is a fiddly beast. By the end of the game you'll have chits stacked on chits stacked on yet more chits, surrounded by similar stacks. At the end of my play, I had 66 pollution chits on the board (not counting ones beneath other chits) and that was just pollution. Another player needed help placing and removing chits as it had effectively become a dexterity element to the game for them.

Second, Antiquity is thematically challenged. You collect food and if your food level is below the famine level some people will die... but the people who "eat" don't actually consume the food they use? And building a hospital removes graves from your cities? What are they digging up the graves for cadavers? And people build cities for the express purpose of having a place to put the dead? There's a fair bit of wonkiness with the theme.

Also, Antiquity is a bit long. If it was an hour or two shorter, I'd be a lot more forgiving of the flaws. There's also issues in that you can just completely screw yourself. Plan poorly (easy to do on a first play) and you could leave yourself with no way to get wood. Or end up being overrun by graves. That's a minor nit as long as you stress the point with new players. The tetris-y nature of the game is always a struggle for me, which means I'm going to always go Saint-Rearrange-your-stuff.

The variable player powers/win conditions seem to work fairly well. And the resource gathering/management aspects are enjoyable and fun. There's just a lot of fiddly, wonky, long mess that goes along with that.

Deep and beautiful--to both the mind and the eye. Lots of fiddly little chits, but that's part of the charm.  Very unforgiving the first couple times its played--but it's a good thing ("fixing" that aspect would ruin the game)!

This reminds me a LOT of the computer versions of Sid Meier's Civilization/Alpha Centauri. You are trying to build cities, you found them on the world map. From that point on, your cities build up on separate minigrids while you harvest resources for them from the map. Fun, but a brain burner. Would rate higher if it didnt take so long ! A 6 rating is "will play sporadically if in the right mood", and play time is the limiting factor on my rating.

I'm surprised this doesn't come out more often, even though it's a LONG/BIG game.  It's real pretty, and the bits are put to good use.  I would play more of this if the opportunity comes up. (My first copy of this game came miscut and I had the manufacturer replace the poorly cut sheets which were pretty much all of them. It still isn't cut perfectly, but now much better - at least playable.)

A well-themed and interesting game that avoids most of the excessive fiddliness of Roads and Boats and adds a lot more strategy.  Its play still is both prone to AP and has just a bit too much of that "fox, goose, and bag of beans crossing the river" flavor for my own tastes.

Love this! I like the way the actions are part of the theme - sending out the carts with the woodcutters etc. Love the components - all those chits! 

We don't always like confrontational games so this one is great for that. You can build up your city without having someone else come along and knock it down. The competition is with the game of course, trying to survive increasing pollution and mortality rates.

Can be a brutal game to learn as you're not only playing against other people at the table but also against the game itself. Two words...Pollution, Graveyards.

Definitely cool.  Definitely idiosyncratic.  There's a deep conflict in this game, with the overflowing optimism of a brand new land to settle, and the countering overflowing pessimism that takes hold as the land is inevitably despoiled with dead bodies and pollution.  What's more, there's a tight, mean little game in here, that utilizes spacing, worker management, and resource scarcity to create a strategic tableau that is rich and varied.  This game has a lot of staying power.  It's unique and richly detailed.

RATING: 4
Long, fiddly, ugly with extremely poor graphic design that makes the game even tougher to play than it should (the player boards, resource tiles, and map are atrociously hard to read, for example). Very average game, not really impressed at all. The box is mostly air, to justify the inflated selling price. I've purchased this 7 years after first publication, and the player mats still have errors (Inns are called Hubs, for example). Awful rule book as well. And no player screens provided, when it's an extremely important part of the planning stage? Inexcusable. Just a totally amateurish production, feels like a bad print and play.

What I did like was the deep thinking required, this is a game where you really have to plan out everything. Playing on gut instinct will not work too well here, it's far too important to have every little move figured out in advance. But the cost for this is the long play time.

Antiquity will warm the heart of fans of civilization games. While there is never direct conflict and seldom trade, all the other civ trappings are there to enjoy. Famine and pollution work relentlessly against you and will eventually overwhelm you. The goal is to satisfy the victory condition of your chosen patron saint before it all spirals out of control, and of course before the other players. As an environmental parable it's brilliant, watching the pollution spill out of your cities and spread across the countryside.  As a game it is a unique experience that I would enjoy more if it weren't so fiddly. I played recently and just couldn't get over the tediousness of the game. The ratio of decisions to process just isn't there for me to consider this a great game. It is a good game I'll probably keep because of its novelty, to play once in a blue moon.

Jiminy cricket, but this is a tough game.  It looks simple and straightforward, rules-wise (and, really, it is), but then you get halfway through the game and realize that your efficiency machine broke down on turn three, and you realize you're in for a world of hurt.  You really have to start off with a plan, thinking about three turns ahead every time you plan your current move, in order to stay competitive in the game.  The different victory conditions, the squeezy nature of the game, and the depth all go a long way toward making this game a deserving recipient of its rank.

I'll give the Splotter guys one thing, they always think way outside the box. Almost all of their games are smart, yet feel more like sandboxes than tight Euro games, including their resource management games. Antiquity is much the same. It's a worker placement game, but it's all done in secret and in real time. Like I said, way outside the box. It also has a neat method of tracking resource development with stacks of chits. Then as you gather the resources, you work your way down the stacks until you hit the pollution tile, at which point it stops producing. This is by far the neatest part of the game not only thematically, but also because it is what forces expansion of your borders and by extension, conflict with your neighbors.

Overall, it's a neat mix of civilization building and the escalating danger that you find in a lot of co-ops, racing the clock as the pollution tiles start to overrun your board. If you don't spread fast enough, they will overwhelm you, guaranteeing a loss.

So it's a very neat game, but it's certainly not for everybody. The chit piles in practice are borderline ridiculous. The hexes are tiny and you have to pause and set all the stacks up every time you place a new settlement or harvester building. The real time stuff can be confusing and there is no real way to double check that anyone at the table is actually doing it correctly, which is kind of maddening in a three or four hour resource collecting game. I enjoyed seeing it in action, but I don't think it's something I would actively seek out or bump other games to play it.

Or maybe I'm just jealous because I don't own one of these grails...

This is a complex and thoughtful game that requires quite a few plays to fully enjoy. In my initial plays, I mainly concentrated on my own city and didn't pay attention to the others. The interaction happens where players are fighting for the land to farm/pollute/etc.

This is a civilization building game where players use the countryside to gather resources, and leave pollution behind.

The game pieces are nothing special and feel kind of drab -- they add mood but not excitement.

A good but not great economic game with a ton of tough choices.  However, I think that those who criticize it for being multiplayer solitaire criticize it correctly.  There is very little interaction in this game.  I suppose you could play it with more interaction, but I think you'd have to have a group of much more experienced players who either went for the encirclement victory condition or really knew how to screw people up at the margins.  Also, it's long and too darn fiddly.  

All in all, more likely to be traded than to be played again.

Played it a second time.  No change in my view of the game.  It might make a great computer game, but it isn't a great boardgame.

This game is 90% solitaire, with the 10% of player interaction being driven by the critical competition for resource spots in mid-game - and even this minor bit of player interaction disappears once players get their Alchemy engines up and running.

My biased "high" rating reflects the fact that I won my only play of Antiquity.  If I'd been one of the players who - with 2  hours remaining - had no chance of winning,  I imagine that my rating would have been much lower.

(Based on a single 4-player game.)

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). A cumbersome game, which may explain why it is frightening. The rules themselves are rather logical and make for an intense, demanding game, with limited player interaction at the first glance. Still there is more in it than a multi-player solitaire exercise in optimisation. The pollution and famine rules are nasty but give the game its whole sense. I would definitely play it more often if I owned a larger table.

I have only played this game once but found it to be too full of bits and too fiddly. Reminded me somewhat of way back when and SPI counter and hex games. I also felt a little like I was playing Warcraft 2 on PC and at times wished I WAS playing on a PC so that the machine could take care of moving all the fiddly bits about. Nothing original particularly. I didn't HATE playing it but wouldn't rush to play it again. And I don't think it can be called a Euro game.

The componenets are very strange, subpar illustrations, but then a lot of chits. Feels somewhat thrown together and never redesigned, but also gives a special atmospheare when playing.

So all in all, I very much like this game.

my, but this does give one the feeling of building up a city economy and expanding your influence over the countryside.  i've played the basic game, without pollution and famine, and i did enjoy the process, but i'm leaving room in my score for more plays.  whew, it becomes really hard to manage a fruitful city when played with pollution and famine.game works better if you build a cathedral relatively quickly, i've found out.  now having played the game several more times, i can say that it is at as good as Roads and Boats, though i give the slight edge to R&B as far as sheer fun.

Another civilization/city building game with competing resources, something I really enjoy playing.  This time, however, you set your own victory condition depending on the type of cathedral you erect.  That is a really neat idea as well as the way how goods are depleted once you've harvested them and cannot be reused again until you've cleaned up the mess you left.  Very intense in the fact that you have to pay attention to every details, from the famine to pollution, from having enough wood, stone and food to manning the correct building so you can obtain its benefits.  It is true that if you select the Santa Maria, it takes away a lot of the bookkeeping from you, but it is my belief that the reverse of that advantage is you tend to lose track of what you are working to and start to overdevelop things you may not need.  Antiquity is very fiddly, with lots of chits and pieces to move around, but it is also one of the best and unforgiving game I've ever played.

It's got to be a good sign to play a game that takes 4 hours the first time playing (with two people) and want to play it again immediately to a) attempt to minimize the mistakes you just made, and b) now that you know what all of the cool buildings are for and how to properly manage your resources, completely switch up your game plan.  Can't wait to play this again.  Antiquity gets an 8 with potential to move up the charts.

RATING: 5
After 1 Play: I was struck by how conflicted my opinions of the games various parts were.

What I like:
-Interaction between building within cities and expanding in the surrounding countryside to gather resources.
-Interplay between pollution and graves, and the constant struggle just to keep your head above water.
-Cathedral system.  This I've never seen before, and is my favorite aspect of the game.  There are 5 ways to win, and you have to pick the one you're shooting for.  Each condition also comes with an in-game bonus, so the earlier you choose, the earlier you get to enjoy that bonus.  Of course, the earlier you choose, the more constricted you are in your options.

That I didn't like:
-Fiddly, in the worst way.  Not with too many rules, but simply too much time spent manipulating annoyingly small pieces. 
-Player Interaction was almost non-existent.  By the time our areas of influence finally overlapped, and we had the mere possibility of interfering with each other's plans, the game was nearly over.
-Time.  Too long, especially considering the limited interaction.  While I'm sure further plays would decrease this, it would just mean that an even greater percentage of the time would be spent dealing the the aforementioned fiddly bits.

So, while I'm glad I tried it, I don't think the pros outweigh the cons enough to make me seek out a second game.

I really like this game, and it makes me sad that it is so difficult to acquire. Antiquity is definitely a high-skill game that will eat you alive if you're not careful with your planning.

I would highly recommend this game if you like detailed, elaborate strategy games with a little bit (but not much) direct interaction.

8/1/07 - Hmmm...My original impression (below) was definitely off the mark in retrospect.  I guess it just goes to show how important it can be to follow Jessie's age-old advice:  Always play a new game twice.  While I've not always been able to accomplish this, I'm glad I managed it with Antiquity.  I just played my 3rd game, and it's really come together.  In fact, for a (at least for now) non-confrontational, 2 player compatible, heavier game, it's really showing promise.  The kicker with this game is that it has a theme/moral, which centers around the pollution of the earth from inefficient use of the natural landscape.  Antiquity is really turning out nicely, and I'm pumped for my next game of it.
----
Initial impression after 1 play with 2 players - not fun.  Despite the fact that we both had horrible openings, didn't realize how all of the buildings worked and basically played suckily, the root of the game was nothing but tedious monotony.  I found there to be nothing fun or exciting about this game and despite the fact that I'm usually hesitant to form opinions after 1 play, this is one game I won't be returning to.  It's not a bad game, just a drab, unexciting one that takes a long time to play (the artwork is great though).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very complex game. There seems to be a fair bit of depth, but it also seems to punish you if you don't do things in the right order.

After more plays I'm not really that enthused. The game really punishes you, which great cuts down on the number of viable options. It seems that there's just a bit too much going on at once.

The other problem I have with it is that all the cardboard chits are pretty small, so it's extremely time  consuming managing the hundreds that are in play at any given time.

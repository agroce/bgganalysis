RATING: 9
Yay! One of my favourites from last year's Essen. Ideal playing time - this one never overstays its welcome. I enjoy calculating my moves in my head. The Maura Kalusky artwork is gorgeous, detailed and very thematic as usual.

RATING: 6
Other than artwork, this has little to do with Power Grid but it is still an interesting game. Two things stop me marking it higher 1) it is very analysis-paralyis prone. 2) I suspect that more plays will result in it becoming "solved" with an optimum strategy being determined. The journey to that point should be worth it though.

An interesting game of pseudo-auctions and resource optimization.  I still haven't figured out the best way to play, but minimizing energy seems pretty valuable.  graphics are pretty cool for this one also.

Rating after one play that didn't even complete. I don't like the map aspect of Power Grid, though, and this is a similar game which avoids this house building mechanic, so this looks promising to me. I'm interested to play again.

Once you get the hang of the rules, this plays fast -- about an hour, perhaps less (quite unusual and unexpected, actually). The toughest part is how to manage the worker quantity to aid in winning the turn order auction... or even if you want to some turns. Interesting game that should reveal more with subsequent plays.

As many have said, it has the feel of Power Grid without ANY of the mechanics of Power Grid. Very odd indeed.

Still, it's simple in design, yet complex -- a sign of brilliance, in my opinion.

Nice and well balanced. However, FM lacks some character to be able to gain immortality. After two plays, I'm also starting to see a certain pattern in this game but hopefully I'm wrong.

The setup is a real pain.

Liking this a lot, a great efficiency engine game but re-playability is an issue, the only thing that changes between games are the people and energy costs which won't make too much of a difference between games once everyone has a rhythm and does the "best" thing

I tired of this rather quickly when you realise that the labour saving machines are useless, just up your storage and production while trying to keep your energy efficiency up, you are quite limited in new machines you can buy so it's best to maximise your production.

Yeah, this is the cold, hard efficiency game you've been hearing about.  I have a soft spot for them, but they usually do me wrong by turning really mathy at the end.  This was a little mathy, but with just 5 turns, it was easy to not be punished for long by a bad decision.

I like this one.  It's all about efficiency.  No catch up mechanisms at all.  Very unforgiving.  I like how the workers are a resource for bidding and actions and tile selection.  There's a small balance between the first and last players in a round, but it's often not enough to compensate for being earlier in the round.

Definitely not for everyone, and nothing like [URL=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid]Power Grid[/URL], but I like it.

Like its big brother, there is a tonne of 'mathy' thought that goes into playing this one.  Balancing the various aspects of your board sometimes forces your gaze only down, instead of across at your opponent.

RATING: 7
Not as good as Power Grid, and not really that similar, but a very good, quick economic efficiency game.

Suffers in the last turn as the game slows down while people try to work out the absolute best move they can make.

Better with fewer players. I enjoyed a 2-player game more than a 4-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple game made complex by the rules, which was well written but was disorganized by the break ups, bold and highlights.

That aside, FM is a simple 3 tier game. Bid, maneuver and luck buy. Each affecting the next in phase, thus creating multiple possible outcomes on every round in every game. 

The good part, is a game you choose the best possible outcome for yourself.

The bad part, is a game that have other players choose for you already, what your outcome will be when it reaches your turn.

Some gamers call that interaction, some call it confrontational, others call it opportunistic. 

Overall, it's a boring but fun game of getting the right numbers to get paid.

Interesting so far. I think people miss the point of this game: it is in the interaction with the players through the market mechanism, not in the optimization aspect. You really have to get into the minds of the other players in order to play your market rounds well.

Surprisingly different in a subtle manner from game to game because of the random "X" tiles, the random turn order tiles, and energy price tiles. You really have to appreciate subtlety in this game.

I need to try it again. Reading my own comment made me interested...

Okay, so this isn't much anything like Power Grid (and I don't need another Power Grid, though I enjoy it quite a bit).

Man, though, some of my GeekBuddies are right. This almost feels just like Spreadsheet: The Game. Almost so as to bludgeon you with the idea of that. Everything is just so calculative and the decisions have such deliberate tradeoffs and etc. that it loses any charm it could have had.

Okay a robot to operate this machine with this storage and get that computer, etc. Over and over, with the same escalating payouts to make it seem like you're hitting the big time (I don't mind this much in Power Grid, but here it's pretty blatant).

The best thing here is selecting for the auctions ... you want to ensure your choice piece is up for purchase, but you'll also want to throw some components that your opponent may be interested into the mix.

RATING: N/A
Takes a little getting used to but is a nice, lightweight game. It is difficult to figure out what the best strategy might be. Looking forard to playing it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Short, stripped down efficiency game (maximise production of boxes and storage for them while minimising power and worker usage).  There's a novel auction mechanic, with upgrades to your factory selected in a two stage process.  However, the auctions that are the heart of the game do not seem very compelling.  How essential is that first place in selecting upgrades? Often not at all.  Still, it plays fast enough to be quite inoffensive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice exercise in micro-management. Player have a factory and by buying various tiles they try to increase the product production while keeping the energy consumption as low as possible. Plays in about an hour. I am not sure if it has enough replayability though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like the original Power Grid, lots of mental arithmetic. Interesting turn order mechanic. Hasn't really grabbed us yet, it's fun but just a little dry. 

...

After one 3p game. The *basic* strategy is maximising your own efficiency. The real strategy is subtle and means denying what other players want and making sure what you want will still be there when it's your turn to buy. This requires quite close attention to the other players' factories. Not sure I'd ever get to that level, and it feels quite boring in the downtime-- so traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
The game has some lovely mechanisms, but the game just makes it hard to improve your position, no matter how well you play in the latter half of the game.  The order for our first play was pretty much set early in round 3.  After that, some people played well, others played really poorly and yet none of the [i]gaps[/i] between the players changed in the slightest.  To me that's a major flaw and I won't be voting for this one again in a hurry.

I'm not a big fan of the looks of the game (it looks a bit, well, dull) but it actually is a pretty good game. It's more strategic than you would think at first sight, and keeping the right balance between investing and keeping your money is oh so crucial. Still, the thing that holds me back, is that it is a bit to much 'make your calculus and win'

Great resource management where every dollar counts. Difficult to decide whether to go first to buy the better items or go last and get the discount and save workers. Depending on what you pull down and what other people go for going last can be workable if there are a lot of spare workers around the board. Few workers means going first is more beneficial.

Factory Manager is quite short economic game. In spite of its shortness it's not a light game. Luck factor is not so big, lots of hard decisions have to be made while playing. like it, but I have some doubts if I like the importance of predicting other players' movements, which is not so easy since there are so many options, and wrong guess makes you big trouble. However I definitely dislike preparations to this game. There are so many components, which have to be sorted before each game. Set-up is a nightmare. After all I rate Factory Manager quite high (7), but I sell my own copy.

Really liked my first play; while it's still AP-prone like Power Grid, the game is much smoother, quicker, and more elegant. Looking forward to seeing how this one develops with more play.

I think a few plays done, now, that the game suffers a bit more from downtime than it should, but is otherwise clever and quick. I like it, but it doesn't have quite the depth and long-term strategy of other games.Probably one of my new favorite 45-60 minute games, just the same.

Lots of maths, feels like you should be playing with a calculator in hand. Last round felt completely superfluous as everything was already decided despite a small difference between the two front players, and turned into an exercise in how to squeeze another electron or two.

First impressions after a 3-player game are somewhat disappointing, though it feels like it should play better with 4 or 5.

RATING: 7
    A very good optimization puzzle where players are trying to increase certain attributes together (production and storage) while limiting energy (reduces income) and man-power (reduces available workers for auctions and actions). While the optimization problem isn't "simple," what you need to do is fairly straight forward. The meat of the game is with the auction mechanic and how players jostle for turn-order. 
    With the auction mechanic, players bid with available workers to win turn-order tiles. Then they bring x tiles down to the open marketplace, where x equals the number of workers that haven't been spent. Thus, players who spend a lot of workers to go first may have first pick but won't be able to do much. And players who go last may have plenty of actions and may get the tiles for cheap (low turn-order tiles give discounts), but they will get last pick. Thus, understanding how to manipulate turn order, what tiles to bring down, and what tiles to take is the heart of this game.


   Some fans have expressed that they think this game would be rated/ranked higher, if it didn't have powergrid in its name. The fact that this is called powergrid gave people the impression/expectation that it was like powergrid, which it really isn't. But honestly, I don't think the audience for this game would ever be as broad as powergrid, which is a much more interactive game. This game is very mathy, quite dry, and somewhat of a one-trick pony with the importance of the auction mechanic. For people who enjoy mathy/optimization games (like me), this is a wonderful treat that provides a nice brain-burn in a remarkably quick playing time. But for many gamers, their eyes are going to gloss over even when the game is mechanically simple and quick playing.

The decision tree was way too flat. Too many tiles to chose from to be able to play with anyone who suffers in the slightest from AP.  Nonetheless an interesting design as you would expect from Freidemann.

The game feels like a lesson in near sighted corporate capital investment.  It clearly shows that upgrades and investments into a company fail to have short term return and that well designed strategies will be very costly in the short term.  ...  Or, a simulation in how to maximize short term turnover.

Nagyon megörültem, amikor megtudtam, hogy van a Power Gridnek folytatása. Őszintén megmondom, én a doboz alapján már az első résznél is gyárban játszódó játékra számítottam. Most végre megkaptam:) A Power Griddel nehéz összevetni (nem is szándékom), de ami elsőre feltűnik, az a nagyon eltérő színvilág. Az eredeti az egyik kedvencem, és nagyon bejön a hangulata, mégis azt mondom, ez a játék ránézésre sokkal pozitívabb benyomást kelt, kifejezetten szép. Nagyon tetszik a játék felépítése is. A látszólag bonyolult gyári táblákon és lapkákon percek alatt elsajátítható minden apró részletnek a jelentése, és a játékmechanizmus sem annyira bonyolult. Elsőre összetettebbnek tűnt az elődjénél a sok változó (létszám, kapacitás, raktárhely, fogyasztás, elektromos áram árfolyama...) miatt, mégis úgy érzem, sokkal könnyebb ráérezni itt egy jó stratégiára, mint az alap Power Gridben. Interakció csak a piacoláskor és a licitkor van, de ez közel sem olyan meghatározó szerintem, mint az eredetiben a városok bekötésénél. Na tessék, mégiscsak összehasonlítottam a két játékot:) Lehet, hogy alulértékelem a 8 ponttal, a későbbiekben ez még módosulhat. De az első parti nem volt rám akkora hatással, mint az elődje, de kétségkívül ez is nagyon jó játék.
---
Elég durván büntet a játék, szerintem semmi kiegyenlítő mechanizmus nincs beépítve: ha hibázol, végleg lemaradsz:)

First Game:  (Mar-6-2010)
The game is very unforgiving and there is really no way to catch back up.  The game has a very bad case of snowball effect.  The game is fiddly to setup and to breakdown.  The game requires so much optimization of so many variables that it takes a long time for players to decide what to do.  This makes the game feel like a lot longer.  It feels so much of the game is waiting.  For how unforgiving the game is, it feels like there is a lot of chaos in the game.  Overall, I am glad I tried the game.  I see that some people can like the game, just not for me.  Certainly, there are things that I would do differently the next game, I am just not sure if it is worth it.

I usually like efficiency games, but I found the mechanics in Factory Manager really dull.  Players first bid for turn order using workers.  The total number of workers bid determines the number of Factory tiles available to be purchased.  Being brand new to the game I was unable to predict what my opponents would bid or select for Factory tiles, so each round felt very chaotic.  Based on the mechanics, I'm not really sure if experience would help me better "manage" the player chaos or not.  However, I do "manage" to see that experience would help me play more efficiently.  On a positive note, I  would rather play Factory Manager than work on an assembly line.

Interesting and short game with perfect knowledge but not a great deal of depth. Certainly much lighter than Power Grid. Timer essential as AP prone players will crucify the enjoyment of others whilst they disect every move.

It seems possible that on the last turn some players best move might be to do nothing. A curious situation for any game. With more plays I think my rating might go down.

Second play and I feel this is a really dry affair. This lacks the balance and finesse of Power Grid and the complete lack of paralel and association with its advertised big brother (plastered all over the box) is nothing short of scandalous. There seems no catch up mechanism for those who do not optimise their early turns.

I feel that my initial score of 7.5 was a very generous opening rating for this and as predicted I do indeed slash that score. 

And then I sell it for £20.00....wooo hooo!

Hyvä peli. Useampi peli takana, mutta killeristrategiaa ei ole vielä keksinyt. Onkohan semmosta edes? Kumminki peli perustuu pitkälti siihen, että on osittain muitten armoilla, joten kai sitä täytyy vaan koittaa aina tehdä parhaansa kaikissa tilanteissa. Toki yksittäisen vuoron optimointi ei riitä, vaan pitää ajatella vähän pitemmällekin. Hyvä hyvä. (6.4.2010)

Edelleen hyvät fiilikset. Jokanen peli on kyllä jokseenkin erimoinen, joskin tietysti lopussa on aina samat optimointipiirteet. Mutta alkupeli sääteelee kumminki sitä, misä mennään. Monesti kun tuntuu että menee hyvin, niin lopussa kuitenkin huomaa jääneensä keskivaiheille. Pistooli peli kyllä. (19.8.2010)

I feel that the game may-very-well be too short, to me it seems to end just when it should be gearing up. Maybe a few more plays will cure me of that nagging feeling.

The game itself is quite good. It's easy to learn while giving lots of choices. Still, 99 times out of 100 I'd prefer to sit down for longer and play [GAMEID=2651].

Good first play with my wife.  Pretty miserable 2nd play with 2 friends.  At the end of that game, both friends felt that they knew who the winner was going to be after the 2nd turn and had good arguments to back their statements up.  I will try it again with my wife.

Allthough I rate Power Grid very high this game could not enamor me. The game is basically one big challenge to be the most efficient. That would not be a problem if Factory Manager would amount to something other than just a tedious exercise in accounting. This game is not prone to analysis paralysis, it is analysis paralysis! The only way to play it well is to calculate all your options ad infinitum. So the game works, the mechanics work but it's just no fun at all. Unless you like accounting of course.

Much better than I feared.  There are some good, simple mechanisms here.  Nothing extraordinary.

The bidding mechanic is probably my biggest peeve, followed closely by the piece selection mechanism.  There is also an unhealthy amount of luck in the production costs - could too easily swing a game one way or another.

I do find the pieces returning to the pile at the end of every turn to be an interesting mechanic.  The cashflow system works well.

Ultimately, other games do similar better, for a similar time stamp.  But that doesn't make this one a bad game.  I'd play it again, but would rather play Lokomotive Werks.

I've played once with two players and a few times with three and four players.  The two player game was very weak, but with three or four players I quite enjoy this game.  I haven't played it often, but I've enjoyed it when I have tried it.

While I find this game really good with 3 or 4 players, it is one of those games where my copy never gets played.  So, I'll just play other peoples' copies once in a blue moon.

Very mathy.  It's quick so it's not like you are doing math for two hours.  Every bit of money helps in this one.  It was decent enough but it was lacking a little something that keeps it from getting to the seven level for me.  The auction is a bit boring, I think is one reason.  Also, for a factory game you just don't feel like you are doing factory stuff.  It's just missing that feel.  It's not bad and I'll play it but I would rather play Chicago Express, which is similar in regards to the tightness of money or Power Grid which has a bit more going on.

Update: Realized today that I would probably not play again when I can play 300+ other games instead.  After my initial play, I never wanted to play again, took it off my want list and can't forget how blech it was.

After 2 plays, is it broken? It seems that the player who stay last in the auction phase gets out of the game because he is unable to purchase nothing good in the market phase. If you maintaing a lot of workers they will ruin your factory and if you have few of them you can not get down from the supply to the market nothing decent to purchase.

I don't know what I think about this game right know but early rating of 8.5 drops to 7.5.

*update*

We played wrong, one misunderstood rule, it was my fault. The game seems to be pretty and clever. I want to play it more.

*update*

I play as a fool this game. My buddies ended the game with double my money. I'm rethinking my hobby for boardgames. How can i play so bad this game!!! 

Degrade my rating of this game because I think I'm not able to understand what's going at the same time my buddies are AP prone here. My 5th play was absolutely a painful experience turn after turn my factory was sinking from begin to end.

A decent economic game that has no resemblance to Power Grid (Funkenschlag).  It is an optimization game where you want to get the most output (product) for the least input (workers & energy).  Machines improve efficiency, and an interesting mechanic is used to determine which machines are available for purchase each round.  The goal is to make the most money.  Since the cost of energy increases rapidly, players must focus on energy conservation if they hope to make enough money to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Branded as Power Grid, but a simpler game. Still mathy though, as you need to calculate potential gains for buying tiles that let you produce or store stuff in your factory and which power-ups are best. There's an optimal route to get things, I'm sure, but you need some luck in what other people also make available for the players to buy, so all in all, an interesting experience!

RATING: 7
Very good economic Euro with really interesting auction / market / purchase mechanisms. I'll say that again: REALLY INTERESTING auction / market / purchase mechanisms.  Should I go for early auction purchase? This hurts my number of picks and actions, won't let me have a discount, and forces me to choose crap to put on the market (since the good stuff is deep in the stores). But if I go for a bad position the best machines and robots, etc will already be purchased.  As with Power Grid, there are certain instances when going last is advantageous and certain instances where you HAVE to go first or lose the game...  I love that this game is short!  I love the mechanics!  The amount of rules / complexity is perfect!  I would rank this game a 10 except for one thing: Each player has to do a LOT of math to keep their income and energy and action tracks accurate and this just tickles my suspicious bone too much... I end up showing my suspicious / jerk side overlooking other player's calculations.  I need to get better at just enjoying my game on my own merits and stop worrying if others are playing accurately or not...

RATING: 4
This one went under-the-radar for me. It didn't grab my eye at first at Essen 2009, but it was surprisingly simple yet brainy and mathy.

Essentially, it's a sequential tile collecting game. This is usually not my type of genre but somehow it manages to be engaging. The bonus is that it does not have a long play time. Its longevity is questionable as this might get stale fast.

Update Feb.2, 2010:
7.5 -> 7.0

During the third play, it felt exactly the same as the first 2 times that we played. It obviously has no legs. You're pulling the same tiles every game. It doesn't exactly offer multiple paths to victory. Just be the most efficient at selecting the same tiles every game. Everybody is playing the same strategy because there is only one. There is zero catch up if you pull one bad tile. If there is one round in which you don't earn the most money, you practically know you are not going to win. Likewise whoever earns the most in round 5 likely is the winner because of the doubling in the last round. Overall, the game got stale fast. Too bad.

Update #2, May 26, 2012:

7.0 -> 6.5

It doesn't have any staying power. It was the same motion of bidding for turn order, than pulling down tiles.

This game exceeded my expectations.  There's certainly nothing particularly new here, but it is well put together, relatively simple, and doesn't have too much business or fussiness about it.

A solid optimization game, where your decisions to balance production with its costs makes for some interesting decisions throughout the game.

Not a huge amount of player interaction, but the bidding mechanism at least adds some element of player/player competition.

Factory Manager is a sleeper, a game I had meager expectations of and which has come on like a ton of bricks.  This thing is much deeper than Power Grid - similarly optimization fiddly, but in a much more straightforward, open way that is very refreshing.

The game seems deceptively simple, and in terms of procedure, it is - basically bid for turn order, choose available tiles for the market, and then buy those tiles.  Adjust your costs and output, take income, and repeat x 5.  What seems like it might get old quick, though, doesn't, simply because the manipulation of the tile market is so hard to figure and the proper sequencing, given the market, hardly ever clear (at least to us).  Yes, like PG, you are basically trying to squeeze out those last few dollars, but doing so in Factory Manager is more completely under your control - what is not controlled by you is controlled by your opponent, so there is a lot more tension than in PG, where everything can feel beyond control and the moments that a player can truly assert themselves are pretty limited.

The game plays quickly, in fact, it ends just as it would start to wear out its welcome.  It scales well (at least, I can imagine it does - it plays beautifully with 2 and 3).  All in all, I was only hoping for a mildly entertaining economic game and got the best game of FF's career, as well as the best tile evaluation game I've ever played.  This one is like the negative image of PG - short where PG is long, easy to play where PG is unintuitive and fiddly, a few deep decisions to PGs buffet of non-choices.  This one is good, very good, and has redeemed FF as a designer for me.

RATING: 6
Personally, I *do* find this game to be a cousin to Power Grid, sort of a Power Grid: The Card Game. Power Grid is primarily about managing of acquisition and obsolescence of power plants. The key decisions revolve around when to upgrade and how good a plant to get, with most of the rest of the game (connections, resource acquisition, etc) being either secondary or the factors that influence you in your decisions about what and when to buy in terms of plants.

Factory Manager is essentially just this one idea, of upgrading and obsoleting plants, focussed and developed further. All the other stuff is gone, now the game is solely about the timing and choice of machine acquisition, and like Power Grid, there is a rhythm to it, and if you get the rhythm right you will win, if not, you won't. Unlike Power Grid, there is little to no room for error. It's shorter at least.

I admit I kinda like Factory Manager. I like how it's taken this one idea, this fairly well-done cycle of growth, expansion, and obsolescence, and built a pretty clever system which allows the game to develop organically.

Alas, I think Factory Manager is sunk by two things. Firstly is the excessive amount of calculation and look-ahead required. This can be a collective-stare-at-the-board game which can have a painful amount of downtime. Players can play more quickly if they want, and the game certainly *can* finish in reasonable amount of time if players play on instinct, but people tend to want to play well, and there is a lot of scope for doing a lot of mathy work, and that work will be rewarded by a better score, making it worth doing. So people will.

Secondly, I think the game is just a bit too constrained. There is no geography, little in the way of alternate ways to approach the game, and nothing to differentiate the players. Positions will diverge just because the game forces them to, but a player who is forced off the track the game needs you to follow seems like he or she is in bad shape. Unlike Power Grid, which plays enough turns for there to be some nuance, Factory Manager is over so quickly and with so few decisions, that it's a very stark game.

Anyway, while I like what Factory Manager was trying to do, and think that it's quite clever for what it is, ultimately it's just not enough and has too much downtime and rewards spreadsheeting to too great a degree for my tastes.

Pretty neat game of building an optimal money generating factory.  The game is only 5 fairly short turns long, so it will make a great game for a longish filler that feels like something more than a filler.  

Lots of tough choices from where you want to bid for in turn order, to what factory parts to make available, to what you actually spend your money on.  Basically everything is a tough choice!  In the end, I thought it was a well-designed game that lacked a little in the fun department for me, but I'd gladly play more.

This recent offering from Friedemann Friese is disappointing, especially given that he created one of my favourite games, Power Grid.  Essentially, a production/resource consumption optimization exercise with weak player interaction and significant downtime (during which food for thought is scarce).  The market aspect of the game lacked real tension; it felt too easy to obtain useful factory tiles.  Much of the game felt like badly-implemented multiplayer solitaire.  I enjoy optimization games in general though, which raises this game slightly above average for me, but I cannot think of any outstanding features that would prompt me to recommend it to anyone else.

This is an optimization (= AP) game with an innovative turn order mechanic. This is a solid design but too slow, dry and mathematical to appeal to me.

I'm very impressed with how tightly integrated the money/people/energy resources are with Factory Manager.  The game plays relatively quickly and the decisions are really juicy on two fronts:  What tiles to bring down for Auction and which tiles to purchase.  The only thing I don't care for all that much is the random energy modifier, but I quite enjoyed how the turn order tiles worked.  Even though it has absolutely no gameplay elements in common with Power Grid - I enjoyed it as much as PG.

It was so bad I thought surely we were playing it wrong. There is not enough real interaction, other than the turn-order bidding...which is so granular that out-bidding someone by one is an exorbitant price most of the time. In other words, the auction isn't even exciting.

The optimization part isn't diverse enough to create its own level of fun or even abiding interest.

Its short, but that alone does not mean anything good. There is virtually no connection to Power Grid here, which I found disappointing.

RATING: 4
The Power Grid spinoff economic game...Fabrikmanager is an odd beast, it has enough similarities to PG to make the name sensible, but it really has few of the tensions present in PG and seems more difficult to control.

The basic flow of the game is as follows: 

1) Auction for turn order (some of which offer discounts) 
2) Pull tiles depicting machines/storage/robots/&c. off the master board and put them into the open market.
3) Buy tiles from the open market, each player buying everything in one go
4) Make money

Rinse and repeat for 5 rounds and you have the game. This is an efficiency game where you have machines that start out requiring more workers and power to make very little product, while later ones give you much greater bang for your electro. The workers themselves are a precious commodity: you only have 7 and 4 of them begin the game working your inefficient machines. Workers are needed to produce things, but also to bid for turn order, to construct new tiles, or to tear down old ones if the factory is full (or if one doesn't want to pay the 10 E expansion fee for the two eastern rooms in the factory).

The game seems to be won and lost in the market, which is...strange. Each round players have some number of spare workers left. When your turn comes up in the "pull tiles down into the market" phase, you must choose tiles equal to the number of your spare workers. Then, after everyone has done that, in order people can buy as many tiles as they have spare workers. This creates a very strange phase because the people who will benefit the most from late player tile pulls are those high in the order, and it was curious trying to figure out how to actually benefit oneself as a late order tile puller. 

In terms of game play, the money that you make is tied to the lower of your production/storage numbers, so if you have 8 production and only 2 storage, you only make the amount of money in the 2 column and not the 8, so you have to keep both tracks moving at the same speed. After having played this, I found myself wishing that the higher numbers actually accelerated in value a bit, because the late game really felt like nickle and diming because there was so little value in increasing things by just one or two steps. 

Regardless, the game fits together well enough. I don't fully understand how differentiation develops between players though. In our game of 3, the person who was in last got hammered when myself and the other player pulled down a lot of tiles that he couldn't use effectively and basically forced him to not do anything for an entire round...I can see where that is how one wins and loses the game, but I'm not sure how to really control it. 

The auction is also problematic, the granularity of the value of the currency (workers) makes the auction stilted. This is the exact same problem that I have with Princes of the Renaissance, and I'll repeat my complaint with that game here: if you're going to include an auction in your game, you need to give players enough currency to bid with and to make that element interesting. Factory Manager fails miserably in this regard.

I do have to make one final beef: for such a simple game this has one atrocious rulebook. The rules are laid out like Settlers with a primary rule book and a supplementary, two-sided sheet that has tonnes of important information that you can't play the game without. Every time a rules question comes up, one has to parse not only the rules, but also the sheet, and it's a serious PITA.

At the end of the day, I think it's a fairly run of the mill efficiency game that could have used some more development. The market mechanic is the only real point of interest here, and it doesn't feel like it's particularly in control. Fairly bad case of anticipointment for me on this one.

Good filler but after 2 plays I cannot work out if this game will grow on me. The second game caused me to start thinking about manipulating player order and trying to making sure that the items I wanted would still be available when it was my turn.

The game does encourage some simple arithmatic and I worked out that buying nothing on the last turn can be a satisfactory approach.  Next time I will be starting the calculation earlier into the game,  it may give me an edge.

Interesting game. A basic auction mechanic. Turn order is everything in this game (so in that sense it is similar to Powergrid, otherwise it is a different game entirely). 

Would play again, but not up the top of my list.

Like its big brother Power Grid, Factory Manager has some tough decisions about how much to spend to upgrade what and when.  Our first play was interesting but it felt a little like Power Grid lite.  Set up is fiddly due to sorting tiles into the market.

RATING: 6
Had the setup not quite right when it was explained to us. As a result, which ended up getting big discounts on the first round, which let us grow too fast. Oops. Luckily Friedeman was there and recognized the problem as we were playing. We played again to play correctly. Makes me wonder how many games people play wrong and never know the difference.

I enjoyed the game more than I expected, given that I heard some people label it as an accounting exercise. While there's some truth in that, it's not really any worse than Power Grid. So if you can handle that, you can handle this. There are a couple things I'm not too sure about, but I'll reserve those as I feel like I need more play for them to bear out.

I'm not sure where this game would end up in the rankings, to be honest. It works, I'll give Friedeman that. But it is such a bone-dry exercise in the quick style of 2010'ish games: a small number of rounds, and you play either at optimum efficiency straight from the beginning or you lose. The game obviously has a bit of a learning curve to master that skill, but at the same time: what is there to learn? The game does not reward player creativity, just agility with numbers which is tantalisingly little more complex than you can easily handle. There is some skill involved in playing the other players while selecting the tiles in the market, and working out where to be in the playing order... But that sort of game has been done before already, and with less computational burden than this title. Finally there is the weird inversion of turn and selection order which is either a brilliant find or a botched attempt at creating an innovative game design. For now I tend to stick with the latter opinion.

Looks and sounds neat, but I really don't get what the fuzz is all about. This is just a game for bookkeepers who hate randomness. Although the game really doesn't take too long, I have the feeling the market-mechanics (the core of the game) don't really add to the tension of the game and just eat precious playing time.

I enjoy the short playing time of this puzzle/efficiency game, but wonder if it will become monotonous after more plays.

Right now, I'm still trying to figure out what is best with regard to turn order, number of tiles to pull into market, etc.  That question will at least lend enjoyment to several more plays.

My biggest gripe is setting up the board at the beginning of the game.  It's worse than Endeavor, because every tile has a specific place it needs to go.  But that's really only a small nitpick.  The game is still fun.

I'm not sure what to make of this game. If gives an illusion of complete economic control, but I'm not sure its really there. Not much is random, but I didnt feel like any decisions were hard to make or calculate.
It seems clear when you really want something and the competition is likely to be fiece, you should bid for first and just buy the one thing, if competition is low for what you want, bid for the dicount. Under very few circumstances will you not bid since having the ability to buy more stuff doesn't count for much since space is a premium. Lesser, better machines will always beat lots ofcrappy stuff.

I did have a small reverie when I felt like I was playing Industrial Waste which i think is a better game. Still, a nice twist on the power grid "auction stuff, buy stuff, earn money" sequence.

Much different game than power grid...and not as good.  It's a game of optimizing 4 variables.  Similiar to Vegas Showdown in that you compare 2 variables and the lowest one dictates your income.  You are purchasing tiles (machines/robots/etc) that alter these variables.

What I didn't like about the game was the mechanism for bringing tiles down to the "available pool".  Besides taking too long, it just didn't feel very tight.  Maybe that was because we played with 5 players.

I'd certainly be willing to play again...probably with fewer players.

The 60mins on the box is a not accurate.  This is a much longer game.

RATING: 7
Players run a factory, buying and installing factory equipment and monitoring consumables, trying to turn a profit.  Fast game played over five turns.  Players influence what equipment is on the market for that turn, and take turns purchasing and installing it into their factories.  Cash is earned based on the lower of "production" or "storage", subtracting their energy costs.  Very quick game, also very unforgiving.  One mistake will probably doom you - but that's okay (just) as the game will play out in around 45 minutes.  I like it.  Absolutely nothing to do with Power Grid, save marketing connections.  More like a spin-off of Muell und Money.

Pretty impressed with this quick 45-60 minute economic game.  It's mathy and has min/maxing... and that's just the point, so the short play time is just right.   The initiative bidding with workers is interesting, and so is the risk/reward in bringing items into market that other players may buy when you wanted them instead. Turn order is huge in this game.  It might get dull quickly and a bit samey, but the artwork and presentation helps.   I liked it more than most people, it seems.

Hát nem tudom. Vegyesek az érzések így 2 játék után. Nem rossz. Inkább családi, és nem a nagy előd szintje. Érdekes, és szép -szebbek a színei mint a Funkenschlagnak-. Egyszerű szabályok. Ugyanakkor a stratégia behatároltnak tűnik: az elején amennyire lehet minimalizálni az áram felhasználást, h így sok -több- pénzhez jutva aztán fejlesszünk amit csak lehet. 3 fővel játszottuk, kíváncsi lennék 4-5 fő esetén mi a helyzet. Egyelőre 7 - igaz inkább fölötte, majd meglátjuk újabb, több személyes esetben mi a  helyzet.
Update: Utó emlékeim szerint inkább 7 alatti  volt a játék. :-). Sőt. De a lényeg újra játszottunk vele, 5-en. Javult. Most már tényleg masszív 7-es. sőt icipicit fölé. Több variáció, nagyobb figyelés. Ugyanakkor a 60 perc 5 fővel...inkább vicc, mint realitás. Most már inkább éreztem , s lehet ehhez az is kellett, h 5-en játszunk- h azért van lehetőség, mélység a játékban. Ugyanakkor a feszültség -már persze az áramon kívül - nekem -és többünknek is- hiányzott belőle.
DE alapvetően nem rossz játék.

Short but sweet. I very much enjoy the creation of incentives that players must engage in to succeed at this game. The mechanism behind the drafting of tiles is brilliant.

I am slightly concerned about replay value, as the board starts the same each time. The differences will come only from player actions and the power market. Of course, many games can make that claim, but this one seems like it may be vulnerable to stylized play. I'll have to wait and see on this, though.

There is a lot going on.
Really like that you can't rush to things, you always have to balance out.

Bidding on turn order with how many workers you get to set out is a nice twist. Also, last in turn gets to be start bidder evens out the game quite nicely, not unlike it's big brother Power Grid.

Played with 3 players, can see how this gets more chaotic for each player.

I am rating this 7, would love to try it again, and would possibly bump it to 8.

2017-04-03 : First play : One of those games that's over before you feel it properly started. It's all about balance : you need to balance pallets, production, workers, money and turn order while planning ahead for the next turn. Get it wrong and you can get stuck for a turn - and there are only 5 turns. The "must keep a worker available" is a clunky mechanic that should have been developed out of this game, but overall it's a game that works, though a bit uninspiring.

[2 plays] This was more enjoyable than Power Grid, though, as I was rightly told, they don't have much to do with each other. Factory Manager is all auctions and timing and optimizing the running of your factory.  It's cool that there are robots, but robots in a factory should be racing around shooting each other up with lasers, not tamely sitting about helping to manufacture goods cubes in an optimal manner.  Though I did feel better about the theme once I realized my factory was manufacturing robot weaponry.  This was not really my cup of tea, but it grew on me a bit the second time.  Oddly, it did make me think of Outpost the whole time we were playing, but only in that "I wish we were playing Outpost instead" kind of way. As in Outpost, production is more efficient if you let the robots do it.

This comes in second to Mare Nostrum  as my most painful play of 2010. At one point, I wanted to stab myself in the ear with a pencil b/c that pain would’ve been a relief to what I was experiencing in this game. 

This game forces you into min/max hell on every turn (but there’s only 5 painful turns!) and there’s no way around it. You need to figure out which combination of tiles will benefit you most, and while everyone takes 3-7 minutes doing that, it means you can go do other things when it’s not your turn. The tiles offer “plus 1 A minus 2 B neutral C” or “neutral A plus 3 B plus 1 C” or “plus 1 A minus 2 B minus 2 C”, etc, and the point of the game is to puzzle all that out -- and you can’t stop. Nor can you start on other players turns (for the most part) b/c you don’t know which tiles will be available to you. Each turn you need to go through the same process of “this and this… no, that and that… no wait, this and that… no…” and then sit there while everyone else does it too. All done with that turn? Here we go again. This game is very much like Planet Steam -- a glorified spreadsheet that should be "played" by a computer to calculate things out for maximum efficiency, not by a human. The human should pick up the report off the printer, but not actually do the calculations. That's why we invented them.

Then there’s that last turn. Took close to 20 minutes for the other three players to compute their last turn and then on my turn, I was (mercifully for time’s sake) shut out of any tile which could help me, so my turn lasted all of 1 second. And then I won the game. Yeah, that’s right, all their computing and calculating and maneuvering to shut me out of a productive last turn didn’t matter b/c money wins and I just sat on my money at hand and won by $15. You should’ve seen the looks on their faces. All that work and the guy who did nothing on the last turn wins anyway. F you, game!

It is less interactive and I think it is a simplier game, yet tight strategy in play order and purchases wins the game.  Lasting only 5 rounds, it can be a quicker game than Power Grid.  The use & rules of robots is rather clever.  I think I might even like this a little better than Power Grid.

My rating is based on a 5-player game.  The game works well and is easily explained.  It was a first time for all players and we all seem to grasp it pretty quickly and the game didn't seem to pose too much of a challenge.  Perhaps too easy so I will wait to play it again to see if the feeling remains.

The track-balancing, budgeting and turn-order jostling is back. Factory Manager eliminates the spatial element and resource types of Power Grid, and explicitly auctions turn order, while eliminating the luck of the power plant draw. Randomness is now only the turn order tiles and power costs.

The loss of a money auction is a pity, but it makes budgeting much easier, and the fewer uses of cash eliminates a lot of its predecessor's AP. The loss of a resource types will be missed - no more market-price screwage.

I like the variety of machine tiles and the way they upgrade, though the machine-robot split is fiddly and prone to confuse new players. I like the theme and the cartoon-industrial art.

I am not a huge fan of Power Grid, but I was quite impressed with Factory Manager.  I like the interplay between increasing production and storage, while trying to keep as many employees as free as possibly while consuming as little energy as possible.  The auctioning with employees as the currency is clever, and I like that the energy cost track introduces a small luck element in the game where you can gamble a bit more than others on when to reduce your dependancy on energy.  It plays quickly (half-hour-ish with 2 players), and while a bit mathy, doesn't bog down.  This one will be getting a lot of play at my house!

I had an idea for a game very similar to this one. I believe this could be a fun game for me. The game was alright, we were still learning the mechanics though. A second play through may make the game more fun. The game was definitely fun on another play through. It's speed has a lot to do with how fun the game is. While you want to optimize everything you don't really have the time to do it all, so in the end you strive for a balance throughout the game, if you expand one area too early you suffer later on.

Factory Manager is an economic optimisation game pretty much stripped down to the bare essentials. Think of Power Grid with the route building removed and the management/calculus part refined so you need to balance production vs. distribution vs. human resources vs. energy in order to maximise your profit. As such the rules are actually simpler and pretty straight-forward, but it's also a very mathy game. The only interactive element is the market which provides a limited number of factory upgrades, not all of them useful to everyone.

What this also means, of course, is that the game doesn't really much if anything in common with Power Grid.

Man, I really wanted to enjoy PG:FM. Unfortunately, it got off on the wrong foot immediately: the rules are somewhat unclear and it took a whole round of starting and stopping before we realized how damn simple the game actually is. The rules do nothing to try and provide examples of turns or give any clarification. Jen points out that FM is a "boy's theme" and she's probably right, as it doesn't bother me none but it bothered her. If I can say one good thing about FM is that its mechanics were quite interesting and it works as a distilled optimization game. I personally didn't find the math a problem. The setup was a bit long, however. The biggest problems were its downtime, as there was nothing really to think about while waiting for one's turn to come. The second thing is I don't think it has the type of balancing that is required and works so well in Power Grid. By the third round the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. Such point swings I think highlight this. In music, I often wonder if the author has written the lyrics first or the music. With FM, it looks like the (largely interesting) mechanics were abstractly written at first and a theme was pasted on the best it could be. In some regards in worked but in others (why are workers forced to power machines or destroy them?) the theme just failed. In the end, the game wasn't bad but it wasn't great neither. I'd play it again and I think a group of players who were 5-10 plays in would do much better, but there are many other games where the optimization theme is greater realized and are just more fun.

It's hard not to measure this game against the vastly superior Power Grid, since the name invites the comparison.

Also hard not to mark it down for the rules writing, which is some of the worst I've seen.  Deciphering the disorganized and overly terse rules was much more challenging than actually playing this rather simple game.  I do not exaggerate.

Power Grid Factory Manager is not a bad game.  But as with many of these spinoff games, I question whether there is any purpose for its existence. I've played just once, and I'm willing to give it one more shot.  But I'd rather not.  Frankly, it's boring.

This game was very tight and all about efficiency. The component feel was much like Power Grid but the gameplay was a bit different. You fill your factory with machines and workers and replace workers with robots and so forth. You generate more income every round and use that income to purchase more things that allow you to generate more income. In that sense, it was very much like Power Grid.

RATING: 7
The power grid tie-in has some things in common with the main game, but is mostly an entirely different game. Instead of running a power company you are controlling a factory which seems to constantly need new machines, robots, warehouse spaces and other equipment. The game is played in five rounds where you first bid with your workers for player order. If you are first out, you have the first pick on the equipment and if you are late you generally get rebate for your equipment. After you have bid for player order each player in turn order picks what is up to be sold this turn and the first player then buys what he wants and later installs or uninstalls old machines (due to lack of space). At last every player get income from what is lowest of production and warehouse space and subtract cost for power consumption.

The game is pretty simple in mechanics, but can be a real brain burner. I like those types of optimization games, but I know that this is not for every player. If you don’t like crunching numbers this is probably not the game for you. I have played it with four and five players and the game seems to scale pretty well. I have a question mark about replayability - I think it will be good for a few games, but I think it will wear out then.

Played 2+ times. I like dry economic games so this is ok by me but not a great choice for most folk. If you suffer from analyses paralyses then also keep away. I have played Power Grid with players who have a pen and paper by their side to help then figure out the maths. I can see the same guys using pen and paper with Factory Manager. I am looking forward to a couple more games but ultimately I think the ability to calculate the optimum purchases (factoring in worst case and best case for the power multiplier) especially in the last turn will prove to spoil the fun and bring down my rating for a game I should like more.

Tentative rating, needs further play.

When I read the rules to this game, my first thought was "Where is the game?" Now that I"ve actually played it, the subtleties come through much more strongly. The decisions to be made are not as significant as in Power Grid, but they can add up just as quickly. I look forward to trying it again.

RATING: 7
The only real connection to Power Grid is that they are both fairly mathy games. Players try to optimise their factories by buying more efficient machines, robots and storage tiles to increase their income while keeping their enrgy useage down. There are some interesting decisions to be made as the last player to put tiles into the market will also be the last to buy, so putting good tiles up for sale may not always be the best bet as you will be unlikely to get to buy them yourself.

But, in my group there always seems to be one 'new' player when we pull out games.  Someone was complaining that it could be 'solved'.  The thing is really any game can be 'solved', but then that's when the competition comes into play and I think if we all feel that there is ONE way to win it, that the fighting and choices will be more intense.

I've only played once, and didn't see a clear strategy, so I'll have to review this more thoroughly when I know what's going on.  My initial impression was that small perturbations can have huge consequences, which is not exactly fun in my books.

After some legitimate plays, I feel very close to giving this game a 10.  I love the tightness and timing of the system.  You must keep your focus up on a number of different aspects while keeping your eye on the end prize.  The last turn especially can produce some interesting results with everyone's planning coming to fruition.

It would be easier to get this on the table than Power Grid due to the shorter playing time.  I feel like maybe there will be a lack of variety in the machines that will keep this from ever hitting a 10 - that the game will always be tight and predictable to some extent.  We'll see how that pans out with future plays.

A very convoluted, yet fascinating bid/push-pull/worker placement economic optimization game from the mind that brought us Power Grid.

First play was painfully slow, and suboptimal, since almost everybody did not know what to do. You start out with mediocre, inefficient machines that produce a limited of goods, and very limited warehouse space. The machines must be manned and powered. Manning the machines means that less workers will be available for the critical turn-order bidding in the next turn. However, you must crank out and store goods to bring in income, so you can buy newer, more efficient machines, robots to help with automation, and other upgrades that help with reducing manpower requirements, and/or power consumption.

The heart of the game is in the bidding for turn order. Like PG, a player starts bidding on a turn order token, but not with money, but with his workers. Lower numbered tokens allow priority selection of factory upgrades to fill out "The Market", and THEN priority purchase of those upgrades from the market after everyone else has selected theirs. They can only select, then buy so many upgrades as they have workers (not the ones that worked last turn). The higher numbered tokens select later, and buy later, meaning they may end up with cheaper, less efficient, and less desirable upgrades. However, they may get a discount that is relative in value to the number on the token. The last player also has the option of flooding the market with double the amount of his workers, on top of his usual number of selections. In this way, it is possible for the last player to do well, as there is no way the other players will be able to purchase all the desirable upgrades; some will be left.

There are only so many desirable upgrades available, so the key is to get in a good turn order, without spending so many workers (if they are involved in the bid, they will not be able to operate the machinery). One the upgrades are purchased, then comes the complicated math. The player must allocate enough workers to operate his machines, less the credit he gets from automation upgrades. Each machine/upgrade consumes power as well, less any power credit from upgrades. Then income in computed as the lower of total number of manufactured goods versus total number of warehouse/inventory, minus any power expenditure costs. This is similar to Vegas Showdown. Power consumption starts out  fairly benign, but can be multiplied by a factor, which is steadily increasing throughout the game. In this manner, there is a break-even point players are trying to stay ahead of. However, it is possible to shutdown machines, so that less power is consumed.

There are only five turns in the game, so this makes for a very tight game. The only random elements are how the turn order tokens come out, as well as the increase in the power consumption factor, which can increase by one or two.

The game should go more quickly with experience, but our first game with all newbies, except one, took two hours. There is a high level of thinking involved in the bidding and buying portion of the game, and player interaction is indirect, but minimal. It seems the game feels like multi-player solitaire beyond the bidding.

There is a lot to like in this game, yet it is clear this is not a gateway game. It is far less accessible than PG, and it may be helpful to have played PG or other bidding games. All in all, another neat game from the intriguing mind of Friedemann Friese.

One of those games where you're astonished at how much can be made from very basic ingredients. A simple optimisation game of maximising your production and storage of 'boxes' while minimising energy and staff costs. A much better game than Power Grid, but you'll be wishing you had a laptop handy in the later turns to calculate all the possibilities. It's done in an hour, but it's so calculational you'll feel as though you're playing a spreadsheet.

Take the fantastic Power Grid, strip away all the good parts, and you're left with this soulless optimisation/efficiency game with all the personality of an Excel spreadsheet.

Actually, I really like this.  It's very different from Power Grid; in fact it is another game altogether.  Turn order is very important and is the primary reason for saving some people instead of using them all to run your machines.  But at heart, it is really a drafting game, one which I appear to be appallingly bad at, having come in last every single time I've played.  But there's enough here to keep me coming back and trying again.  (3 plays)

This game is a ton of fun and another gem from the Friedmann Friese series. His games always feature elements of strong strategy, balance and a fair bit of maths. Unlike power grid, this is about optimisation and efficiency. If there is a downside it's that it's not easy to pick up, particularly for players who don't play complex games regularly. As the one doing rules tutorial/lawyering it can be a bit tiring when you're teaching it to a new set of people, but it doesn't stop me wanting to play.

Obviously, the engine for this game bears a lot of similarity to Power Grid.  Although I think the game mechanics here are a bit more intuitive than Power Grid, thus this one has the potential to play faster.

Very much a resource management game, with several different resources in play.  Reasonable fun factor, but - like Power Grid - it has the potential to be very "mathy" (i.e., a game in which the human calculators have an advantage over the play-by-intuition types).

Did nothing wrong.  But really nothing right.

Whole lot of checking and counting and adding and subtracting.

The pull down mechanism was sorta cool but didn't really have a huge impact.

The go first and pay a lot for the best stuff versus go last and get the okay stuff at a steep discount just mainly meant it didn't matter at all when you went in turn order.  You were going to get good shit at some point.

Yea, I don't like Power Grid, but at least Power Grid had an epic feel.  This one didn't.

Maybe it was the mood of the evening, but the game succumbed to the classic "most important rules are in fine print, as an afterthought". We spent about 35 minutes reading & referring to the instructions to figure out what happens when. The instructions are poorly designed.

The game is fun and worthy of a second play now that we understand the instructions a bit better.

At first it seems ok, but nothing special.

Later on the game starts to shine  - it's difficult to master and it seems to be very rewarding.  Playing it feels like real fun despite the game is based mainly on optimization and calculation.

BUT in the end (after 8 games) the game has worn out for me - now it seems too dry and I have no pleasure in optimization here (not to mention that I suck at this game BIG time...)

Sold.

RATING: 5
Reminded me mostly of GOA though I like Goa much better as the auction is much more interesting. 

It was mostly a fresh game but it didn’t grab me overall. Trying to build a more efficient factory will likely really appeal to some people, for me I just didn’t like the overall format of the game. It works fine mostly (although last in turn order has limited control) but just wasn’t all that interesting, its kind of a bare bones type of game; you add tiles you might want to buy to a pool and so do the other players then you take turns buying tiles, add up your income rinse and repeat that’s the game. 

This aspect might also appeal to some and maybe me sometimes but I guess not this time.  Deciding what to buy from the pool seemed to bog down every turn creating some downtime, people need to calculate funds and check factory status etc and see which tiles benefit them the most, no way around it but it would speed up with more play.  Turn order is BIG, now there is an auction for it but you are bidding with your guys, at the beginning of the game you really need your guys so I wasn’t that keen on this auction.  There is a little rich get richer here too since whoever has the most money can pull down better things from the tracks and then only he can buy them or they'll just buy more stuff in general but our game was still fairly close so maybe it is in check not sure, overall it did feel mostly balanced.

while Power Grid is in it's name it's almost nothing like it.  When I saw it in front of me and the rules were being explained to us I thought of "Industrial Waste", which I think it still has some components of.  It also seems to borrow from "Brass" for the energy cost multiplier market, "Le Havre" for the way equipment comes into the market place, "Power Grid" for the auction of the turn order, "Industrial Waste" on several fronts with most obvious needing to balance things with energy consumption (in IW it's waste), etc.

However it does come together nicely.  With 5 turns it can be tricky to recover from early mistakes, but game is short enough you can learn from your mistakes on subsequent plays.

RATING: 6
Fast, vicious economic game. Almost too fast - the game ends just when you feel your factory is beginning to get up to speed. Also, determining the winner solely on cash in hand seems strange, as it may result in situations where the optimal move in the last turn is to basically do nothing (since the cost of buying anything outstrips the extra income it might give you).

I would like to play again, and I might potentially end up liking this a bit, but I am not rushing out to get my own copy...

After one game, it's a '7', which is really my way of saying "I enjoyed it well enough, but I haven't made up my mind yet".

Played for the first time, and I want it. A lot of the same kind of mechanics as Power Grid as far as balancing turn order/action/resources, but more opportunities to interact w/ your opponents. The pull-down system is hugely deep and requires a lot of perception about your opponents' gamestates and short-term/long-term goals.

At first I liked this optimization game a lot, it was one of the first games I ever played, even though I liked it I have never really wanted to play it again. I´m not sure why but I´m not having fun while I play this. Maybe it is for one for the following reasons:

* The long downtime you can experience with the game, furthermore, if you are playing with the full complement of 5 players.
* The low level of tension found in the game.
* In all my games all the players have used the same strategy, so maybe the replayability factor can be an issue, in any case I wouldn’t know as I have played the game 3 times and I don´t plan to pursue additional plays.

In conclusion, for me, the game is boring but I have seen many people who liked it,  so try it and judge by yourself.

Mr. Freed-Man Freeze is a strange duck as a designer. In some ways this is refreshing and entertaining, and in other ways it can maddening. There is a clear wit to his designs, to the art he chooses, and to his personal and business marketing. He is a very welcome and much-needed presence in the gamer (notice I did not say "game") industry. This rascally wit goes right to the mechanics of his games, which also makes his designs at once refreshing and maddening. Factory Manager is a very typical FF kind of game.

Factory Manager is, at its heart, a very calculative, bare-bones economic efficiency game. In the hands of most designers, this is where it would end. However, the twist that the game introduces turns the number of actions you can take into a very limited form of currency. There is an auction for turn order in the game in which you do not bid money, but you bid workers. You only have 7 workers each turn - with the ability to buy 2 temporary workers - and so bidding even one worker is costly, because then you cannot use that worker - or workers - the rest of the turn. So how important is turn order? Is it worth paying a worker in order to manipulate this?

There is a clear advantage in going early in turn order, as you will have the best range of factory tiles available to purchase. However, if you go late in turn order, you get discounts - sometimes significant - on everything you buy, although the selection can be very limited and difficult to optimize. You need workers to operate your machines, but you also must have one worker available each turn for the auctions. In principle, this is an intriguing wrinkle in the efficiency engine genre. In actual play, if feels extremely limiting and almost claustrophobic. The rest of the game is pretty standard - buy tiles from the market that collectively affect your income, your use of workers, and your costs. Use workers to clear out old equipment and to operate the new equipment. Do this more effectively than your opponents over 5 turns and you win. Even though you buy machines with money and money equals points, the heart of this game is really about managing your 7-9 workers effectively. It is easy to miscalculate something and find you don't have the workers to do what you intended.

There isn't going to be a lot of variety in this game from one play to the next. The tiles are always the same (depending on number of players) and come out in a similar order each game. You always have the same number of workers and options each time you play. Everything is calculable, so players will tend to stare at the board for periods of time performing slight variations of the same math problem in their heads to optimize their moves. While the worker auction is an interesting twist, it doesn't lead to enough variety in strategic options to explore with repeated plays.

As with most of Friedmann's games, the art is appealing, the components are nice, and there is an underlying wit to how things are presented (workers sit in the "canteen" when working, for example). But also, as with most of Friedmann's games, the rules are poorly structured and weirdly difficult to grasp on a first read and the game lacks broader strategic options that would promote repeated play. Power Grid also shares the rules issue, but that game is worth figuring out because there is a wealth of player interaction and options once you get all the niggly little rules down. This game, not so much.

Me ha decepcionado un poco el juego, esperaba más tensión, mas pelea por las fichas, pero siempre hay disponibles un montón.

El tema creo que le pega muy bien a este tipo de juegos, pero creo que la parte del mercado no ha acabado de funcionar como yo pensaba tras leer las reglas, siempre hay bastante donde elegir, si no te llevas la que quieres te llevas una que hace tres cuartos de lo mismo.

Para mi ha sido una pequeña desilusión, a la hora de jugar a un juego de Gestión de recursos prefiero hacerlo a otro antes que a éste.

I´m a little bit disappointed by the game, I was expecting more tension, more fight for the tiles, but there are always a lot available.

The theme matches very well this type of games, but I think the part of the market is not finally working as I thought after reading the rules, there is always enough choice, if you don´t get the one you want you get one that works almost the same. 

For me it has not been as I expected, when playing a game for ressources management I prefer choosing another one instead of this one.

There's nothing really wrong with Factory Manager, but more importantly, there's nothing really right with it either. I'm surprised this is a new game. The basic premise is quintessential for eurogaming: juggle some interlocking resources and snowball efficiently. A lot of games focus on that as a goal, but this one includes it as a theme. 

The solitaire player-board part of it is easy to understand, and the interactive bidding/drafting part of it is rather arbitrary. Not bad. Not compelling either. There's no false advertising with this game though. I just can't see wanting to play again in the future. 

Mostly this feels like "back to basics." With a couple of exceptions in the mechanics, I would expect this game to be from the 1990s.

Friedemann should stick with developing games in the Power Grid universe. His second best game so far and again great looking. It's not really a quicker version of Power Grid. The main difference is that the important turn order is decided by an auction limiting your abilities to develop your factories while in Power Grid you had to artificially stay behind in development to benefit from positive turn order effects. Kind of upside down Power Grid. The key decision when to start your run for the top is gone. After three out of five turns we were thinking how quick this is. But in the end we still needed two hours. The last two rounds get very mathematical. All information is open and players tend to ponder their purchases thoroughly. No game for AP experts. Other players should have a second look at the purchase price calculations as mistakes will (and do) happen. 10 Elektros more can decide the game. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this very much and I'm thinking about ways how to improve. Collecting the most income over the course of the game made me second because I also spend the most (too much) money on improvements.

I like the theme of the game as well as the artwork.  I can see how many would consider this to be boring.  I can also definitely understand the term "spreadsheet game".  I suppose if I was better at calculating, or just smarter, I could do a lot better, but I'm having fun just exploring the system.

I like how quickly the game plays and the mechanism that makes the tiles available, making turn order very important.  I find that Factory Manager actually feels very similar to Power Grid, in that you are looking for more efficient machines, but have to balance the different benefits and drawbacks as well as watching that you don't forget that ultimately it's only money that matters.  The extreme importance of the turn order is also reminiscent of Power Grid, as if you let it happen, certain tiles may disappear before your turn, severely affecting your game.

I would definitely not recommend playing with anyone suffering from AP, as you could easily get a really drawn out game.  In my mind, once everyone knows the rules, this should never take more than an hour.  A player that spends too long deliberating will ruin the fun.

Fun if your real life job is flipping burgers or stocking boxes on shelves.  Gives you the feeling of being a manager.  Does that so well that its actually work your doing so anyone with a halfway rewarding job in real life would rather, you know, just do their real life job than play this mess.

Players auction workers to get the right to decide what components are brought into the market and the right to purchase them first, albeit at no discount. This game centers on creating the most efficient factory that you can through energy management and keeping costs down. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins. While this game is nothing like power grid, accept some minor auction mechanic similarities, I find myself begging to play it again. Whatever it is that Friedemann Friese does with economic games such as this one I enjoy. This game is intuitive and entertaining.

Quick but thinky economic optimisation game. Optimisation of both your factory (production, storage and energy) and your available workers/actions. Interesting interaction between the auction for player order and the market mechanism for the factory tiles. Subtle player interaction. Gets better with more plays. Doubted the replayability, but up till now all games have evolved very differently.

2 player. Enjoyable however the most maths heavy of the Power grid games I've played, the maths felt heavier than adding up the connection charges in the original game. Being first is too powerful and it felt like there were more ways to get boxes than pallets, so the end game pallets look too powerful.

RATING: 7
strange calculable game. I tend to do well in this type of games but in this game i was dead last.

It reminds me of industrial waste managing different things.

I did too well in managing my people (none needed) and electricity needed and because energy prices were extremely low (movement of electricity 0,0,+1,+1,+1 ) I completely missed  my production)

There wasn't a lot of blocking tiles which I found strange also. so basicly you tend to build a factory with good tiles. My opponents didn't tear something down ( I tore 1 storage down)
5 rounds feels to quick. It's probably perfect but basicly that means that it's a sprint. the winner of our game is a person who allways starts quick but then gets realed in by people who are planning ahead.

I need more plays but I would be surprised if this turns into a favourite of mine.

A bit too much slow-paced and solitairish game with very minimalistic competition. Another issue is, that there should be more hidden information than there is now.

In Stock

Each player owns a factory and tries to earn the most money during the game. To be successful, each player must use his workers to buy the best machines and robots at the market and to run the machines most effectively in his factory. Because of increasing energy prices, the players must be careful to check the energy consumption of their factories and to avoid using only energy-consuming machines. Otherwise, their profit will suddenly vanish, the worst fear of a good businessman.

Tienes que conseguir tener en tu fábrica las máquinas más productivas pero manteniendo el equilibrio entre el consumo de energía y los trabajadores que necesitas para manejarlas.

Who would have thought you could come up with a game more mathematics heavy than Powergrid.  Still a good game, but you don't "play" a lot despite the length.  5 turns is (too) short but each often drags out as everyone tries to optimize.  Definitely suffers from analysis paralysis (AP).  That amounts to relatively long play sessions of unsatisfying "short" games.  Buying order often prevents others from effectively planing while one plays.  The whole concept is great and I love all the machines, interactions and optimization, it's just a tad fastidious to implement.  This is better with few players and it helps if they are good with numbers.

The game works and functions fine.  After a play or two, it will also play very quickly.  However, I wasn't wowed after my first play and am uncertain how much time I want to "invest" in the game.  It is interesting to see your factory develop keeping power cost, manpower requirements, storage ability and production ability all in mind.  In a nutshell, I'm just not sure the game is fun.

Accountant game that is not really fun to play (with 5 players at least).

Cons:
- initial setup time is long
- setup each turn is also long (replace all tiles)
- it seems that with 5 players a lot of tiles were in play (with a wide variety of choices) which made winning the auction a bit pointless).
- Last turn (or even last 2 turns) can be very long since every one is optimizing their gain.

Pros:
- nice artwork.
- I like robots!

I think that it's fortunate that I listen to some of the negative talk and lowered my expectations. I think it is even more fortunate that I had played Vegas Showdown and Peloponnes before this game.

Those things being said you end up with an above average game that is worth playing on occasion. Played quickly enough it does contain enough tactics and variety to make it intense and fun. 

It's not destined to be a regular once everyone has had a shot at it; that's because Peloponnes does everything here a bit better, and is more popular in my group, though everyone still "enjoys" PGFM.

The components are great, especially the meeples and artwork. The paper money could do better, but with the same quality with Power Grid. The cost of electricity is far too low, the factor has low impact for decision making. The number of workers is important for bidding turn order and buying.

This one sat on my shelf for 2 years before finally getting played, which is a shame. My first reaction is that there are interesting things going on in this game. There's lots of things to balance: production and storage need to be kept in line, and while maximizing these things is important, using too much power will eat into profits, and using too many workers reduces the opportunity to go early in the turn order and to buy good machines (and lots of them). The similarities to Power Grid are evident not in the theme or mechanics, but in the importance of deciding how much to spend when, and in balancing advancement with turn order. I'm a bit worried that with repeat plays, this game might see the same strategies win over and over, but logically, I doubt this. In a game where players determine the value of turn order, there can't be a fixed strategy for winning; rather, a good strategy will involve picking the right time to react.

A simple and brilliant design from FF. One of the few boardgames that my wife enjoys playing.

I think it's simpler than PowerGrid because there is no map strategy (there is no map) and all your focus is on productions, whether reducing energy consume, whether acquiring better machinery. In PG you had to take into account the price of the power plants, the price of the raw materials and the locations on the map, while here with a single factory to manage it's easier to understand what you're supposed to do.

Игра по личным впечатлениям, очень сухая. Атмосферы строительства фабрики нет. Игра оперирует цифрами и расчетами постоянными,а если я куплю это, то изменятся такие показатели, а в конечном итоге это такая сумма. Я бы рекомендовал игру экономическим институтам, так как моделируется взаимосвязь и баланс между рядом показателей, но по факту - тема игры могла бы быть любой. Взаимодействие между игроками - минимально. Все сводится к торгам очередности хода и кто-то мог ранее купить агрегат, который планировалось купить самому. Рекомендация: приглядеться к этой игре перед покупкой.

Update after another play since 5 years: still a very good smart economic game. The best by Friedemann.

RATING: 5
I like this game a lot.  It's fast pace.  It's also very calculating.  The mechanism of putting back all the unsold "goodies" in the market is very clever and push you to have a lot of available worker to dig but you must also chose to keep workers in the factory!!!  ARRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHH  Decisions, decisions, as I like them.

Edit December 2010 : This game don't grow on me as did Power Grid, which is also still one of my favorite game of all time.  Factory Manager is still very good but I don't think it will age well...I must admit one thing though, it plays relatively fast, which is a good thing.

Edit may 2017 : NOT a very good game at all.

RATING: 8
The green-haired one sticks with what works in his vaguely-related factory game. Like balancing when to buy plants in Power Grid, you have to balance the spend of workers in the bidding round against plant production. Bid too many workers and suffer when you can't build facilities/staff production. Costs increase over time, and one needs to keep an eye on power consumption. Some neatly clever mechanisms coupled with reinvention of some Friese has used previously. A great distillation of the manufacturing process. Only a few core elements remain (for example, you never actually find out what it is you're making), but all are thematic and relevant.

Another winner.

It's certainly different enough to get. And it works with 2 players as well.

I don't feel this is a bad game, but I just didn't really enjoy playing it.  It's a nice puzzle/optimization game, but nothing really "wowed" me about it.  It almost felt like there were aspects that were too much like solitaire, while others felt unnecessarily competitive.  I certainly didn't hate playing it, but it felt like there were better games that we could play.  It very well could be that my love for Power Grid has clouded my judgment, but there didn't seem to be anything special about this game.

I like this better than Power Grid, because it is more streamlined, there is less arithmetic, and you don't waste turns playing chicken.

RATING: 6
There's elements of Automobile and St. Petersburg. I'm fascinated by this game. There's quite a few meaningful decisions packed into a short timeframe. 

Choosing what to place in the market: The core of the game. If you are early in the turn order, you would like there to be just enough good tiles for you to grab. If you are late, you want tons of good tiles or none. Timely selection of tiles that don't help your opponents is a great idea. Avoid blue early. Storage and boxes. Extra guys are huge because they help you with the auction.

Turn order auction: You bid with your available workers, leaving at least 1 to buy/install equipment. Bidding flows in reverse order of the previous turn's order. Early turn order is advantageous. We saw bids of up to 5 workers in key rounds.

Choosing what to buy on your turn: Since your space is limited, usually you want the best, most advanced stuff for your factory. Storage, boxes, extra guys, energy.

Choosing what to power: mostly trivial.

Choosing if/when to destroy or buy extra factory space: an important finesse, but mostly trivial.

Efficiency and profit maximization.  If that's something you find engaging then here's your game -- appropriately titled.  Truth be told I enjoyed playing the 2-player game as it provides quick play and just the right amount of control.  In the past I have frowned upon games, such as Das Zepter von Zavandor which seem to focus too much on just the economic engine.  I don't think I would want to play this with 4 or 5 since I'm not so great at multi-variable calculus.  I'll let you know what I think if I do.

Full-on Euro, although marketing rather than comparison is the reason for it using the "Power Grid" name. Mechnics have some taste of Power Grid, but absolutely no (rail-style) routing involved.  Theme is cute -- manage a factory! -- and the concepts of power, output, income, and resources (workers) go well together.  Not as complex as Power Grid, and main interaction comes from bidding for turn order.  Kinda sad that there's no diminishing returns (although it seems quick enough as is).

Don't be confused: this game is not an expansion for Power Grid; it's a completely different game.  

The first time mmy fellow gamers and I played this, we all were in a fog of confusion during the rules and first turn.  The mechanics deviate from those of typical euro-games (e.g., turn actions are taken all-at-once, even though this gives the first-place player a big advantage), and there are a ton of buildings to choose from that all look great.  So it was in a fog that we started the first game; then, after the first turn the fog cleared, and a beautiful game emerged.  

This is a tight resource management game, where players must buy tiles to produce and store goods (from which they earn money), but doing so occupies their workers (so they can't buy more tiles) and requires energy (which costs money each turn).  The purchasing mechanic is elegant: on their turn players each pull down as many buildings as they have workers to be bought, and only once everyone has pulled down buildings can players buy buildings (and the first player to go gets to buy all their buildings).  Turn order becomes crucial.  

The game is a giant balancing act, and a very fun one.  Play it - you'll like it.

This game got on my radar because it seems to pack a lot into just an hour. But I found the complexity to be an illusion; this plays more like a 30 minute game with a bunch of busy details layered on top trying to confuse you. Despite the lengthy setup and myriad tiles, each with a different array of icons and a cost, there are really only strategic consideration in this game. First, you want to have more tiles from higher up on the display than your opponents. Second, if it looks like energy costs will be high, you want to emphasize tiles high up on the right side of the display; otherwise, gun for those on the left side.

With this in mind, the game comes down to tactical minutiae. I'm sure more experienced players will be able to eke out minuscule advantages each turn, knowing when exactly to bid one more worker to get just the right tile down so you can grab it for an extra $3 or whatever. You could probably go as far as to predict what every other player's optimal tile pulls were and plan around that, netting yourself $1 more. But this just doesn't seem like a very interesting process to me. Pass.

This game is all about efficiency as the players allocate their workers in order to work machines, purchase new machines and increase the capacity of their factory to pump out boxes of goods.

For me it was too much algorithm and not enough game. The player is super tight, meaning that a bad slip up can see experienced players crush you through combined actions. 

Games shouldn't be this much work and so little fun. One for hard core gamers fore sure and even then maybe not for some of them.

Each player is a factory manager, acquiring tiles with crates or boxes to generate money. Players bid on player order, then take down tiles that can be pruchased. Players then purchase in player order. Players also have to manage their energy production and waste that they produce.

It's an okay game. Those who like the hard to analzye aspects of bidding and guessing who will bring down what tiles to purchase will enjoy the game. It's not highly interactive, but it's okay. I have played once with 5 players, and will be happy to play again.

Remember when you first heard about Power Grid? If you're like most people, your first thought was probably along the lines of "That sounds pretty dull, maybe even boring." If you're also like most people, once you actually played the game, your reaction was probably "What an excellent game... and not boring at all!" Factory Manager is where all of the "boring" wound up.

I had played the prototype a couple of times, and really didn't like it. To me, it felt like an idea looking for a game. When I heard that the finished product was out, I was looking forward to seeing what changes had been made and seeing what was done to spruce up the spartan look of the proto.

To my dismay, the answer on both counts is "very liitle." The look of the game is very workman-like, certainly fitting of the theme,  but therein lies the problem. You are literally producing amd storing widgets, using parts that cost money, energy, and manpower. Your exciting job? Balance these numbers. Ooohh... I'm all a tingle! The biggest problem is that the gameplay FEELS like a perfect simulation! There's a reason I don't run a factory in my real life... because it's something I have no interest in!

I think Friedemann is a great guy and one of the most interesting people I have had the pleasure to know in my life. I may not like all of his games, but I always want to try them because I know I'll see something fun or cool or ingenious or quirky or SOMETHING... Factory Manager delivers none of these, and is the last game I would ever expect from 2F Spiele.

Factory Manager is completely different than Power Grid, however, you can still see at the surface similarities in the two games.  I can't easily describe the subtle similarities at the moment, however, I remember them being there.  I will update this description after another play.

Each player has a factory with a certain amount of available space to add machinery into.  You want to watch the energy your machines cost to run because every turn this cost changes.  

An interesting mechanic that decides what machines/robots/executive offices are available each round is each player decides what tiles to pull down for availability.  You might not want to pull down the powerful one if you do not have first choice.

The game was interesting and short enough to garner more plays in the future I hope.

It's an economic game, very mathemathic, very AP prone

The game works well, but it's too much thinky for the fun it provides, the time between your turns feel long and you pay errors costly: the snowball effect is terrible; you can't recover.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (3 player): I was hoping to have a little of that Power Grid charm with less number crunching. I think Factory Manager managed to live somewhat to my expectations. There is similarities like having capacity (for goods) and production (of goods) that determine your income and fighting for machinery. Also a big plus for having same graphical design as in PG.

I'm a little bit concerned about how replayable the game is because there are always same machines in same order to be bought. I'd also like to see how the game works with 4/5 players because players later in turn order might get to choose between poor and bad choices of machinery.

I liked the game quite a bit and even though there is brain burning number crunching sometimes it's not as bad as in Power Grid.

A very quick hardcore optimization game, with high quality artwork.

Catching up might be a bit difficult but not completely impossible since the number of workers is very limited. And even if you actually get left behind, you still have interesting stuff to do with your own factory, so you won't suffer the usual two hours of agony like in so many other optimization games.

The final round will be a pain if played with overanalyzing AP players. Just kick them in the nuts and tell them to buy the most expensive tile.

It's not as good as Power Grid, but then it's not really like Power Grid anyway. Should work well for most groups that want a fairly quick optimisation/efficiency game, but be aware that number crunching in the final rounds and a long set up process can be frustrating. Players need to be of a similar level of familiarity to make for a competitive game.

A game of grinding through the rounds, ramping up a production engine that needs balance between all its parts. As money is tight to begin with, the early decisions are based on which part to let go to the dogs because you can't afford everything - meeple savings (will restrict your bidding power and purchases next turn), electricity (costs will soar), or production power / storage (lower income). Later on, the decisions are more calculatable - will buying this one or this one net more money - so the decisions are easier but take longer, leading to downtime. There can be key fights for the right to buy first on the market and get the most efficient tiles, but there's a weird-ass mechanism that makes it less attractive - other players will dictate what tiles will be available to buy. So, an interesting balancing game, but I'm worried about potential lack of variety from game to game due to the need to continually balance.

Good game about efficiency in running your factory. I love it and find it juicy, but many gamers will find this a bit dry. Good graphics and design. Game plays from 60 to 90 minutes. Nice for 2 players. This game really can go in under an hour if everyone gets to know the game.

The mix of factory tiles remind me of Homesteaders a bit.

"Optimization game with an odd drafting system. Not bad, but I'm not fond of the drafting, nor the seasonal workers. Setup is a bit fiddly."

What I like:
- Quick 5 rounds (65 minutes for 4p with 2 first-timers)
- Winner is whoever has the most money at the end
- Only indirect interaction (taking tiles; auction for turn order)
- Seems deep without being too complicated
- Tough decisions

What I don't like:
- Drafting is a weird mind-game
- Seasonal workers span turns in a weird way
- Probably only 1 strategy to win (but tons of different tactics)
- The auctions are minor and often dull
- Setup is slightly fiddly

This is nothing like Power Grid. Even the phases within a round really don't map that closely to PG. I like PG:FM much better, because it doesn't have the parts of PG that I dislike (triggers for stages, geographical competition, odd winning condition). I would put the weight a bit lower than the BGG-voted 3.0, so maybe 2.8.

Based on one play: The similarities to Power Grid are there in the form of the order changing for different phases.

Well worth a try.

Bella idea, quella di uno spin-off ludico. Con Power Grid siamo produttori di energia: qui siamo utilizzatori finali di un bene il cui costo cresce (e a caso) ogni turno.
Un gioco di ottimizzazione risorse, impreziosito dai bellissimi disegni di Maura Kaluski. Ci si sbizzarrisce, nei pochi turni a disposizione, per costruire la propria fabbrica: compriamo altri macchinari o aggiorniamo quelli che abbiamo per consumare meno? Meglio assumere più uomini o investire sui robot? Ottimizzazione dei costi e dell'energia o alta produzione e alti consumi? 
Le meccaniche sono abbastanza semplici, anche se l'aspetto matematico rallenta un po' il gioco.
Certo, Power Grid è un'altra cosa, ma Factory Manager è un onesto sequel.

I'd describe this game as a balancing act--you want to get product, but not necessarily more product than storage (and vice versa).  You don't want to use too much manpower, but you don't want to sacrifice too much product to cut back either.  And using energy isn't that bad at the beginning, but by the end of the game you're really going to need to limit it.  The turn order mechanism is really at the center of the game; where you are gives you a varying amount of control over what happens.  The game is very unique--I don't know anything else like it.

Warning: This game has nothing to do with Power Grid, aside from the art.

5/2/10: I was pretty let down by this game.  I was excited to play it, but I found the game to be uninteresting and dry.  The game just felt too mechanical to me.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I felt that the decisions weren't interesting.  I could see how I may enjoy the game more on subsequent plays, but the problem is my first play didn't entice me enough to ever play it again.  It's one of those games where I can't find a reason to play it over similar games.  It doesn't offer a compelling theme, mechanic, or ample excitement/tension to distinguish itself.

Quite a nice game. Has a slightly casual feeling with a lot of space for optimization without being too prone to AP. Also the length is tolerable. I played with 5 players and it worked well, don't really know what's the situation with any other number of players.

Although it shouldn't have the name "Power Grid" in it, since it basically has nothing to do with it...

I didn't feel the payoff for making all the calculation (try to go first or not, what to auction, what to buy, what to replace, etc.) was entertaining enough for me, considering how many calculations need to be made, especially on the last turn.  The first few turns were more straight forward since the money is limited.

RATING: 8.5
Although this game inherits the style and initial appearance of Power Grid, it is quite a different game.

It is still mostly about managing resources to create an efficient money-making engine, but the elements involved are quite different.

There is less of a focus on autions and constant mental arithmetic. For example, in Power Grid you can easily mess up badly by miscalculating, over-spending and being unable to afford enough resources to power your plants. 

Here, it is more about carefully positioning yourself to purchase the correct upgrades to your factory. The phases in a turn are more streamlined, although a hesitant player can bring the game to a halt while they analyse the available tiles.

Not as deep, and perhaps not quite as much fun as Power Grid, but still a good game. It is also shorter to play, slightly less mentally taxing, and better suited to playing with 2 players too.

Components are all great, although (as with Power Grid) a set of poker chips make transactions much quicker. We use small, numbered chips that can be easily hidden in your hand.

WARNING: Rules are not very well written, being unclear in various areas.

Fun game, with a very nice mechanism for determining the machines that are for sale. I'm a bit worried about the replayability, as there aren't that many different strategies for the factories.

A little mathy--money as VPs ensures you are trying to maximize every dollar.

A major disappointment as it had been one of my most-anticipated Essen '09 releases. For a short game, it has a very fiddly set-up, and it's really the epitome of the individual player board optimisation/efficiency games that I've been growing increasingly sick of. Unlike its parent game, the complexity of the game is generated by the complexity of the ingredient tiles and not by effects emerging from simple ingredients and player interaction. A game with all the excitement of filling in your tax return.

RATING: 6
An extremely unforgiving economic engine game with a few too many opportunities for player screwage.  The rules are not kidding when they say that 5 player games are only for advanced players: by the time the last player goes there may be absolutely no workable options available, something that is difficult for a skilled player to deal with, let alone a new player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I liked this game at first but it has quickly worn thin with each successive play. I think my biggest beef with the game is it's very player dependent. If the last player doesn't know what he is doing and pulls down too many tiles for the benefit of the first 2 or 3 then he will "break" the game the same way that an inexperienced Puerto Rico player will break the game for the others. It took two games to figure out a strategy which I implemented today for the win. The scores are also very close considering the various paths, although the paths are too similar for it to be much fun for me.
The other thing I didn't like is the structure of the money/point engine. The game forces you to expend both cargo and machines at the same pace so that your money will grow. That means in the end everyone is doing the same thing and player one will usually have the best choices. IF you try to go down one path quickly and then catch up on the other path you will fall too far behind, which is what I tried in my first game and lost terribly. I don't like games that are inflexible that way and too structured.

After 1 play I'm torn between "I really want to play that again!" and "Man that was a lot of math for a game!"  I think with a new organization of tiles and maybe including a calculator to speed up the buying phase, it will make this game faster and more enjoyable.

After 5 plays - added a calculator to help with math and bagged tiles by type instead of player number.  New bagging helps considerably with setup and take down times.

Power Grid - Factory Manager is a quick shot of Power Grid.  There are only five rounds of play in Factory Manager and the player with the most cash at the end wins.  With five quick rounds to crank out cash this is a game of extreme efficiency completely uncluttered with fluff.  To begin a turn players bid workers for turn order.  Then players move machines, robot and storage tiles of various efficiencies from the potential market to the current market.  Money is used to buy these tiles, but workers are also necessary to install them and renovate the factory floor if space needs to be made.  Once the tiles are installed it affects a number of factory stats that govern efficiency.  At the end of a turn the energy cost multiplier is revealed and players make money.

There are a number of stats that define each player's factory: Production, Storage, Energy Consumption and Required Man-power.  A player's income is based off of Production or Storage, which ever is smaller.  A player's energy consumption is multiplied by energy costs and subtracted from income at the end of every round.  The multiplier starts out at 1 and can increase up to a maximum of 8 by the end of the game.  Additionally, factory machines require men to work them.  These workers can't have been employed previously in the turn to bid on turn order or to install/renovate the factory.

The meat of the game is obviously what tiles you get and when.  Each tile has its own stats that affect those of the factory.  Some tiles produce much but have high energy and man-power costs.  Other tiles reduce man-power costs and energy consumption.  Some tiles provide for larger storage capability.  Players choose, in turn order, which tiles are brought into the current market.  Then, also in turn order, take turns buying any tiles they want and can afford.  

The game is pure number crunching with the only unknown variable being how much the energy cost multiplier will increase at the end of the round.  What tiles you bring into the current market will be a function of what you need and what you don't want to make available to the other players.  It's necessary to know what your stats are and how to improve them, but also what the stats of the other players are and how not to help them out too much.  It's first come first serve as far as purchasing tiles is concerned so turn order plays an important role in this part of the game.

By dispensing with role selection/worker placement in favor of an auction, Factory Manager feels like a throwback to the pre-Puerto Rico style of efficiency game, a rare beast in today's game market.  While it's a pure number crunching game the math isn't difficult.  That combined with the fact that there are only five rounds keeps it from lasting more than an hour.  The game is fiddly.  A large amount of tiles are used every game.  These tiles need to be organized and you will have to remove certain tiles depending on the number of players.  I'm concerned that the game could become scripted.  There are only a small number of tiles you can bring in to play each turn and bidding for turn order is on a small scale.  I love the art.  It has the same campy faux-serious look that Power Grid has.  While Factory Manager is mechanically only superficially like Power Grid it is fun in the same way in a shorter simpler package.

Despite its light-hearted tone Power Grid is somehow imbued with the feel and flavor of the political and economic state of global energy production.  It makes you think about the state the world is in.  Power Grid - Factory Manager to a lesser degree manages to capture the state of the manufacturing world.  It's not just a fun game, but a game that says something about the times we live in.

After a few plays now, I can safely say that this game features next to no similarities to Power Grid.  That's fine, by the way, because this game has a few interesting mechanics that make it unlike any games I've played before.

Brief aside about the rules: the game sounds complicated initially and the rules could really use some help in the clarity department, but run through ONE round with everyone and the game becomes easy to play.

Balancing income versus energy usage is interesting. Never using money to bid for turn order is interesting. Never directly competing for one specific component is interesting. In fact, I would say this game is just interesting. And that's unfortunate, because just being "interesting" doesn't make me fall in love with a game.

It feels formulaic. I can tell this is going to be one of those games that has ONE strategy that just works regardless of who you are playing against. Even worse, if you fall behind early on, you are SCREWED. The rules make a point to note that one mistake could lose you the game, and that is absolutely correct.

I won't turn this game down if someone suggests it, but it isn't going to be on my list of have-to-play games.

This game has one huge problem: the end game. The game doesn't reward having the best factory, only having the most money, as if the world is ending and the factory explodes on the last turn.

The gameplay problem is that this makes the last turn extremely boring, as players are pretty heavily incentivized to do little or nothing at all and just sit on cash.

Played once.  Seems ok with interesting mechanic of everyone first filling the market then everyone going shopping so that the last player might not have any good stuff left at all -- let alone what he may have chosen to fill the market with.

This is not a game for the casual gamer.  there is a lot of analysis in this game and may take 5 or 10 games to really get a hold of it but that said, I really enjoyed this game.  It has difficult decisions and a good mix of strategy and tactics.  however, this seems like it might be brutal of newbies with experience players but some of the best games like Puerto Rico have the same problem which to me is not a problem since the game is relatively quick.

After only 1 play it's very hard to judge this game. (5p, all new)
I really like the "Funkenschlag" feeling of it.
Auctions are very quick because there is little to bid.
On the other hand, the action-fase had a lot of downtime, that causes players to lose interest.
But I think the mainreason for this is that everyone had to learn the pre's and con's of the tiles.

When everyone knows the system better, I bet that this will be a very funky game.

Don't let the name fool you. Factory Manager is its own game, and one that doesn't appeal to me. You bid on turn order with workers, select tiles from a board based on that player order and how many workers you have left after the first part, then power up your factory and get income based on the lower of your positions on two tracks. Then you do the whole thing over again until the game ends, then whoever has the most money wins. S'ok.

+ fun optimization game whichs plays in a limited time frame (about 70 minutes - this is remarkable!)

+ easy to explain

+ Nice blend of mechanics: engine building, bidding, original way of making investments available and some worker placement-type mechanics in buying tiles and clearing out old tiles

- pain to set up with all the different tiles

- very 'mathy': not for gamers who don't like to carry out calculus on their way to victory

- Runaway leader effect might happen if players are unevenly matched.

- Prone to a dominant strategy? [not enough experience to tell this for sure]

- Somewhat luck-based mechanic which determines the rise in energy prices.

At its heart a game of determining the net payout of improvements added to one's factory - so much so that the last round might be one of shutting down machines as the cost to buy replacements just doesn't pay out.

The term "Power Grid" is used here for marketing purposes and doesn't have almost anything to do with the gameplay, since only the auction mechanic is remotely similar.

When the guys I played with were setting this up I thought we were in for a long game. However, 2 of the 4 of us had never played before and we completed the whole game in just over an hour. Extra time required for rules explanation.
Graphics are very good and the mechanism is a mix of many other games. I did get the feeling that this could have been a real classic game if an innovative mechanism could have been introduced. 
My one game was very close indeed between all the players which was a good sign. Maybe with more plays, stopping the leader may be an issue.
Definitely want to play it again.

oh my. Here's the thing (after soloing the game) :
1) Theme works. It is what it is, but the graphics are charming and evoking of ye olde times (like 1950s) in factory business. Much better than PG
2) The game is optimising within restrictive frame. Hated in Endeavour and hate it here. Because there's a limited amount of actions per game, you must optimise and plan every move from the start, and that's not much fun to me. Selection of machines is clever and makes an interesting multiplay environment, yet not enough to save the game from optimisation hell.

[4 plays] I am glad I finally got to try Factory Manager. Did not really like it, but I tried. Lots of people have denied the comparison to Power Grid (even though -hello!- the designer and publisher _named_ it that), but I actually do see the reason why they gave it a sister name. Like the delicious phase of the power plant auctions in Power Grid, Factory Manager is is all about proper timing of the internal upgrades of your factory. That is the entirety of Factory Manager - and player interactions with true consequences were few and far between. I rate it a 6 because I'll play it again if others suggest it. It's OK, despite the scathing remarks to follow.

Here's why PGFM falls short of original Power Grid. While Factory Manager is all about properly timing those upgrades, Power Grid has that same element in the power plant auctions - but Power Grid also has geographic route competition, a shared resource market to compete over, turn order considerations that actually have drastic consequences, and an uncertainty of required capital (if my route gets taken, I need to hold enough money back to make sure I can still adequately reach my goals for the turn). Factory Manager by comparison is a one trick pony. It expands that upgrade timing moment decision into the concept for the entire game. Worse yet, you could nearly play the entire game without a single glance at what your opponents are doing since the market availability mechanism is chaotic and way too nonrestrictive. While this amounts to enough to make a slightly boring game, it is nowhere enough to make a good or great game. Think about it, if the totality of the decision tree offered here were your actual job, you'd probably have to get a new job or kill yourself.

Corey proclaims love for this game. Without insult, I can understand that. I loved Soduko puzzles when I first tried them. However, I predict he will rapidly tire of Factory Manager - much as I quickly burned out on Soduko puzzles once all the cold lifeless solving mechanisms had been laid bare. By contrast, I believe Power Grid will never feel tired to me, because it has multiple and interweaving mechanisms that require true and meaningful player interaction - resulting in a game with a heart and a soul.

In my first game against three veteran players, I came in a fairly close second to Corey, so I am not ripping PGFM because I sucked or didn't understand it. I am ripping it because I did understand it.

Most recent play 8-21-10 with Corey, Andy, and Donovan.

UPDATE: ________________  1/27/12

This game changed my mind about FM. It isn't horrible. It is a good game. That said, I'd prefer the original Power Grid or First Sparks. My criticisms after the first game are valid, but way overblown. The market mechanism needs to be better explored before I can get a grip on how much strategy and control a player can exert on what he brings down and when. There is less player interaction, no doubt, than original PG or FS. 

UPDATE: ________________  Jan 2015

I do not love this game, but it is a solid design that I only wish had more interaction and felt less terribly dry. Rating remains a 7.

Lots to learn here - but had a good first game with Jen.  The income phase reminds me of Vegas Showdown - where you need to keep production and storage close together to maximize your income.  I like the electric chart and how it may fluctuate.  Turn order is balanced, but I think I'd rather go last early and go first late.

A Power Grid folytatásában saját gyárunkat építjük, amiben megpróbáljuk a gépeink, robotjaink, raktározási képességünk megfelelően optimalizálni. Figyelnünk kell az áramfelhasználásra és munkásszükségletre gépeink esetében és nagyon fontos része a játéknak a játékossorrend, amihez érdekes módon pénz helyett munkásainkra lesz szükségünk. A játék szebb, mint a Power Grid, de annyira nem letisztult, itt több mindenre kell figyelni. A játék fix öt körből áll, ami három játékos esetén akár egy órán belül le is megy. A játék gondolkodós játékosok esetén viszont elhúzódhat, főleg öt játékosnál. Valószínűleg az optimuma négy játékosnál lehet. A játék érdekessége még a piac, az egyedül belassuló rész. Itt ugyanis minden játékos szabad munkásai után kerül egy-egy lapka eladósorba, ez öt játékos esetén akár 25-30 lap is lehet, amiből a sorrend szerint válogathatnak megvételre a játékosok. Ennyi lap közül már nehéz gyorsan a legoptimálisabbak beszerezése gyárunk számára. A játék talán túlságosan is büntet a hibákért, vezető játékost csak összehangoltan, tudatosan lehet befogni. A szerencse szerepe szinte elenyésző, így ezek miatt komoly, tapasztalt játékosoknak ajánlom. A Factory Manager ötletes folytatása a Power Gridnek, nagyon jó mechanizmusokkal, viszonylag rövid játékidővel. A nagy előd szintjét, annak zseniálisan letisztult mechanizmusai miatt nem éri el, de a játékélmény számomra egyáltalán nem volt száraz és talán a Power Gridnél érdekesebb is.
A pontszám emelkedhet még, ha további játékok során azt látom, hogy a játékban vezető jobban kontrollálható kevésbé tudatos játék esetén is.

[2011-09-26]
Kezd tisztulni a játékkal kapcsolatos képem. Egyértelműen több út vezet a győzelemhez. Az energia értéke alapvetően befolyásolhatja a játék végeredményét, úgyhogy ez a szerencsefaktor érdekes színt visz a játékba. Bele kell kalkulálni, hogy a lehetséges növekmények szerint mi a legoptimálisabb vásárlás. Meglepő, de a játék nem lassult be négy személlyel, ahogy gondoltam korábban. A piac tényleg nagyobb, de nem nehezebb a választás a több lapka közül. Így azt mondom öten se kell félni a túl hosszú játékidőtől. Többféle út vezet a győzelemhez és akár 1-1 pénz is dönthet a végén. Egyre jobb a véleményem a játékról.

Take the fun factory game from Power Grid, strip out any charm that it has and then create an efficiency model where players do nothing but attain the most effective combination of tiles -- viola -- you have Factory Manager.  The game is about as exciting as the name.

I'm getting tired of pure engine, parallel play games.  In this one it really just feels like all players are trying to abstractly tweak a tighter and tighter production parabola in order to squeeze the most efficiency out of the tiles.  That's it, no theme no nothing. This will get you that, this other tile is the same but better.

Here's the exciting turn order. Bid for turn order/draft tiles/draft from what was just drafted/tweak your player mat, repeat.  Ugh. 

Even if I liked this game, which I don't, I can't imagine it being all that replayable.  What's left to see after the first couple of plays?

I don't expect good games from FF, but I do expect fun ones, this one is severely lacking on both ends.

A fine two player game that plays rather quickly and is quite challenging. Its a stripped down, lighter version of the Le Havre genre, basically a big puzzle with slight variation where players are trying to get the highest score possible.

I have heard some criticism about replayability but I don't see it. I especially liked the auction affecting ability to make future moves and the market mechanic whereby other players can snag what you are have brought into play.

A much more interesting version of Power Grid. My favorite part of the game is determining how many workers you need to keep your factory running while getting through to use them for bidding on the following round. I think it's more dynamic than regular Power Grid, eliminating the inevitability that is generated when playing with the map.

Compared to Power Grid, Factory Manager gives you more calculations, less interaction, and more sitting and watching other people figure out what they're going to do.

An optimization game that shares little with Power Grid -- just the artwork, and the turn order mechanism. It's lighter and plays much more quickly, too. But it's not nearly as tense as Power Grid.

--- Summary ---
Turn order is initially random. Players have meeples working in their factory (running various machines), with a few extras used for bidding. Bid first on chits that set the new turn order, with players later generally getting discounts on making purchases. Then, in turn order, pull items into the market (as many as you have free workers); the last player may pull extra items. Again in turn order, buy items from the market (with cash). These are various items that work in a factory (machines, robots, storage areas, efficiency improvements etc.) -- they either add or reduce the number of workers or electricity needed to run the factory, or modify income gained by operating your factory. Most cash wins the game, so you can try to save money each turn. However, generally the first 4 rounds are used to create the best factory possible and the 5th round is the real money maker, since income is doubled that round.

A tight economic efficiency game with some calculations that really challenged my brain (doesn't take much).  I enjoy these types of games where you're building up your economic engine.  Interesting decisions as to whether to start taking some profits vs. continuing to build.  I'm torn between rating it a 7 or 8.  It's a 7 for now because it feels a little bit like work, but that may be attributable to becoming familiar with the game.  Also, it feels so tight that it's almost chokingly tight.  I did have fun though and look forward to exploring it further.

Enjoyable 2 player first game. I wonder if i'd like it as much without the Power Grid branding.

Don't like with 5 players - too much down time as each player chooses there bits. They effectively have to take there whole round before the next player - means you can be waiting a long time.

Think it will be a 2 or 3 player game for me

Initial thoughts:  Very tight optimization game that had us paralyzed with AP for most of the game.  In our game, one player had played before but it had been awhile and the other four were all new.  It took us about two and a half hours to finish the game.  This is largely due to the fact there were so many tiles and everyone had to calculate all the different combinations each time they went to buy.  It also seemed like there is no catch-up mechanism in place.  Overall it is an intersting game and will take more plays to determine it's overall value. Edit: with more plays, it seems it is possible for players to catch the leader.

This game is as dry as its name suggests. Although it isn't particulary heavy, it's  a dense optimization puzzle, even more so than games like Caylus, Age of Steam or Le Havre.

Although I like the optimization aspect of games, it's going to far in Factory Manager. Anything you do requires calculation after calculation and I tire pretty quickly of that.

I found my one game just entertaining enough to give this a reasonabvle rating (at least the game is not insanely long like Le Havre) but to be honest, it's very mechanical, dry and soulless. Any further plays will most likely send my rating down.

Very cool game, that is prone to group thinkers. I suspect who you play with will greatly change this game.  I have one player who pulls down JUNK so no one can get "something good" then complains that he didn't get anything good.  I chuckle of course, because what he really wants to happen is for the good stuff to be available when he's chooing early,  and for everyone to collude so that nothing good is available when he is choosing late.

Factory Manager is a deceptive game, easily mistaken for a soulless accountancy / optimisation exercise. Naturally, the question of replayability has then reared its ugly head.

After 8 plays, I'm enjoying this more and more. The heart of the game seems to be in managing & exploiting availability: playing your part in dictating which improvement tiles become available this turn, and selecting from the available tiles those that balance benefits to you against hindering your opponents. Sometimes you're just taking advantage of unexpected opportunities, because what you can buy this turn might not be available next turn.

The way different players assess different situations has dispelled doubts about replayability.

Great game, but a little too mathy. Wish there was some more chaoticness to spicen it up -- similar to my opinion on how Power Grid it dry. But for what it is, it is still a decent game -- although I really need to try it with less than 5 players.

EDIT: After another play the game felt way too mathy and AP prone. Feels like each move is almost purely calculatable and not actually interesting. Still okay for the economic progression part, but not something I'd want to play on a regular basis or very often.

Oh dear God, this is the most tediously unfun game I've ever played.  It's the dryest optimization game I've ever seen.  There are a lot of choices, of that I have no doubt.

Not so many options. You wan`t be first in every round. You would buy expensive things, but usefull. The last player can buy cheap, but nothing special is left. 

You buy the best thing that is at the moment important for you. So you don`t have a real choice.

The name of the game should be only Factory Manager (without Power Grid).

Everybody says much optimalisation in a short time. There are only 5 rounds, but the game isn`t short. 1,5h or more!

Factory Manager is mathy but there is no need to accurately predict the fixed ending.  Despite the busy art, the tiles (and the game) lack sparkle.  All of the options are right there on the board and each is predictably better, and more costly, than the previous.  With conflict limited to a bland auction, it's just multiplayer solitaire optimization.

One play is really not enough. The bidding on the order is a crucial element in the game I didn't have a good feeling for. Also this game could use some experienced players. Like any math-/optimization game it is prone to AP. Other than that I find it to be one of the better micromanagement games (which I tend to like less and less). It feels more complex and less intuitive in comparison to Funkenschlag however. Nice job on the artwork!

It is stripped down, has nothing whatsoever to do with Power Grid (which is clearly a marketing ploy), it scales from 2-5 seemingly well, and it is relatively easy to learn.

Somehow it manages to make the brain gears grind to a halt, in spite of its simplicity.  The game makes simple choices take a longer time.  Now, this is forgivable in a game that goes so quickly otherwise.  

But enough about the nits and all.  It is a pure optimization game, with small elements of other games tossed in for good measure.  It has zero heart, it is all mechanics (which is nearly always the kiss of death for me), and is the only thing that gives it any flavor is the art.  The funny thing is, I really like it.  And Caron loves it--more than Agricola she said--which means it'll get requested.  But I do like it.  Mainly because I think it does what it wants to do, and does it in a shorter amount of time.  Whether or not that stands the test of time remains to be seen.

RATING: 4
Found this quite boring and there seem to be a lot of jarring contrivances in the rules (such as the way the market is filled and the way the turn order auction works) which detract from it as well.  Not even close to being as good as Power Grid.

Good fast game. Still lots of choices to be made and shares some mechanics with its older sibling.

RATING: 7
After one play this looks fairly fun. The auction element is fairly quick (and we actually played it wrong). Pulling tiles into the market is in interesting mechanic and makes for some interesting choices, particularly trying to second guess others.

The main problem is AP and down time. It can sometimes it can be hard to plan what you are going to buy from the market until it is your turn because the available tiles will change. The game certainly has some feeling of the mechanics of Power Grid but has its own twist. I did not get the same feeling of satisfaction as I do playing Power Grid - more plays are needed to see if this will climb in my estimation.

Themed around building up a productive factory that can balance production and storage capacity with trying to keep electricity costs down. Workers are a key resource for various actions, but you can't put too many automating robots into your factory. It's a short exponential growth game, victory entirely based on remaining cash, but it isn't clear that there are any mechanisms which stop an early winner just accelerating.

First Impression:

A surprisingly engaging medium euro with a strong theme.

The theme is strong in this one, as is the sense of accomplishment with each player nurturing its own factory. 

The game remains simple at its heart (that's good) with a convoluted auction system being the deciding success factor. Unfortunatelly the main mechanisms although working are not elegant, and cause some unescessary delays and rules hunting for no reason. The game still works however. There is also the snowball engine problem, but with the game ending in five rounds it doesn't have enough time to actually materialise.

This is a very strange euro. Mechanics wise there are a lot better euros, but this one is strong on theme which is rare. Overall, I like it.

Cool idea, and a nice Power Grid-like look and feel.  While I enjoy playing, especially for its almost filler-like length, I think it ultimately falls just short of great for me.  The mechanics of turn order bidding and component buying seem gamey and don't bear any relation to the real world.  The game feels a bit like a business school exercise in factory optimization.

This game is like math class, but worse. Make sure to bring your calculator, and let me know if you see anything new after the first few plays, which I find highly unlikely. As a friend of mine put it, Factory Manager is "one of the most literal spreadsheet games and dry as a bone; each turn you bid for turn order, buy some tiles and adjust some numbers; best adjusters wins." That's remarkably accurate: best adjuster wins. You literally just take turns selecting tiles to add to your factory which adjust your output, and make money each turn based on that output. I was obviously wary of Factory Manager given my distaste for Power Grid, but since everyone said they were very different (and they are in fact very different), I thought it was definitely worth trying. I am glad I tried it because it did make Colonia and At the Gates of Loyang seem worthwhile by comparison (although not Alcazar, which still takes the cake). Factory Manager was simply the most boring and dry new game I tried in 2009. It's a math problem without the slightest of board game veneer, so if you're eager to face off against your opponents in a battle of calculations then go right ahead; I'll just be over here getting a root canal instead.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed playing this, but it was a bit dry.  I won the first game I played, and felt like I would win based on the first purchase I made.  Those who played in that game tended to agree that it may have a runaway leader problem- however it is a short enough game so that "flaw" may be acceptable.  We had a heated discussion about trying possible house rules to "fix" the problem we perceived after one playing, and ended up playing a second time with the rules as written.  It seemed to work better the second time, but it still seemed like the only choice on your turn was to simply calculate which combination of tiles best improved the efficiency of your plant.  I am not a big fan of this one.

I really like the look of it. I like the art far more than the art in Power Grid, Fearsome Floors, or any other work by the same artist (although I admit they are very similar). It reminds me of comics from my childhood, like Dick Tracy. It has that "old" charm, but not so old as to depress me. Anyway, I am not sure how much this influences my impression of the game. I want to love it simply because of the way it looks. So far, I do.

Don't think that this game plays anything like Power Grid - it doesn't. Compared to that game, the auction part has been trimmed down severely (although it remains just as important) and the focus lies on purchasing the most efficient factory tiles at the right time.
With only five rounds to play, there is a lot of game for its playing time. After one game, however, I worry that there aren't enough different strategies to pursue. That the winner is the one who plays the little auction part best. But only time will tell.

Heavily based strategy game.  Some things are out of your control while others require planning ahead several turns in advance.  The game itself is not very long (5 rounds) and like PG the game tries to balance itself out, but does not reach the level required like PG allows.  It has some replay value, but does not allow itself to be different every time you play it which means it can get old fast once you get down a strategy.

After one game I'm not quite sure what I think yet. The game seems like it can be quick, but could also be dragged way down by analysis paralysis. I think it would be best with 3 or 4 people.

The delicate optimization dance between energy and workers and production and storage is definitely interesting. I think that I got most of the rules right but I'm not 100% sure...

The verdict is still out. I need a few more plays.

Edit: Really enjoyed my second play of the game at BBG.CON 2012. Picked up a copy recently.

Some interesting ideas, but when playing this game I largely feel like one of the automatons pictured on the tiles. It doesn't help that downtime is a bit of an issue and there is a bit of an economic snowball effect, potentially putting a player out of contention with still over an hour of play time to go. But maybe with more experience there will be fewer serious mistakes and things will flow more quickly. Yet by that time I'm unsure the game will be worth playing, as it seems the strategy is always about the same so replayability seems a big issue. I would certainly like to play again in order to satisfy the urge to "get it right this time", but I have to think that once I've mastered the puzzle there will be little to revisit in this title.

RATING: 6
(First Impression Comments)  My first warning against this game was the branding of the Power Grid name, for a game that has very little to do with Power Grid.  Sure, the auctioning mechanism was the same, and sure, the last-place-player-goes-first mechanism is also present, but beyond that, the game has very little in common with its namesake.  In addition, the game just isn't very exciting, and it seems to have that one optimal path that player should take, if the game plays out in its own perfect little way.  I'm not fond of those sorts of games (they wind up feeling a little programmed, like with Puerto Rico), and besides, there's not a whole lot in this game that's very exciting.  I would definitely play it if other people wanted to, but I won't buy it, nor suggest to play it.

(Second Impression Comments): I wonder what it is I missed about this game the first time around, because the second game of it I played revealed some aspects I didn't see the first time around.  The game design is simple, and is more or less dependent on the choices the players make over the course of the game.  The random drawing of the initial tiles keeps the game from being too static, and I think I missed that in my first game.  Now I think I WILL play this game again, and might even buy it if that game is as interesting as my second one.

The first time I saw this game on BGG, I thought it was a joke.  I thought some geek was poking fun at Power Grid's ostensibly boring theme and name.  But no, it's a real game!  And months later I still can't get over it...  I love a quirky theme and have never been one to snub a game about bean farming or chili making or whatever.  I can even accept pleasing a 17th century European prince for the 10 billionth time.  But *managing a factory*?!  Come on!  I think Friese is just seeing how loyal all you suckers really are.

It's ok.  That's the best I can do.  

It has some elements of fun, but the best I can tell is that at the end of the game, you have plenty of choices for factory parts, and it comes down to picking the right combination.  

There really isn't any scarcity or tension in the game, so it just devolves into a puzzle of putting your factory pieces together in the right way.

Factory manager is een korter en gevarieerde variant op Power Grid.

Spelers zijn managers in een fabriek en proberen deze zo efficient mogelijk in te richten waardoor de productie maximaal is.

Ultimately you are trying to build an efficient factory. Bid for turn order. The workers that you do not bid with get to pick things that could be purchased. The last player can add a few extra things also. Then in player order, you buy the things that are available. It is a big puzzle trying to get the right equipment available for you when your turn finally gets there. The last turn can bog down as each player calculates their absolute maximum points but it should get better as people play more. The problem is that you not only have to maximize your score but you need to evaluate what equipment is going to be left for your opponents. Your best score may also allow another player to outscore you. You are sometimes better off scoring less and leaving the more expensive stuff for your opponents. The last turn can bog down because of this.

Why does this have Power Grid in its namesake if it plays nothing like it?  Is it for exposure and advertisement purpose?  Anyway, get rid of any preconceived notion you may have with that deceptive title.  The only thing that is similar between the two is the theme and the calculation (although Factory Manager is a lightweight in comparison).

With a stripped down bidding mechanic.  Factory Manager basically took away most of the player interaction as well as the strategy aspects and made it a near solitaire experience.  Each person put up a specified number of machines, robots and upgrades for purchase, make his own buy, then collects income.  Rinse and repeat.  There really isn't much to it beyond that.  Honestly, even as a casual fan of Power Grid, I've found this addition to the "family" to be fairly lackluster and disappointing.

Power Grid lite is a good synopsis. Plays in about an hour and keeps the core gaming concepts of power grid tight. Will play this agian soon.

RATING: 6
There's a "strategic sameness" in the game in terms of what you buy, so there aren't a lot of strategically interesting choices like there are in Power Grid.  This consequently makes the game rather boring.

After 2+ Plays: Some fun to be had, but nothing to make me request the game.  I also suspect a lack of replay value, though I'll probably never play enough to confirm that.

This game is far more fun than you would think it would be.  The wife and I enjoy it thoroughly and would love to play with more people.  Thank you Secret Santa!

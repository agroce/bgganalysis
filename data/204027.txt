This is one of the only games I've ever stopped playing in the middle.  The more we played, the more it became obvious that no one was enjoying it and we all agreed to stop playing.  Quite an ignominious achievement for such a short game.  I guess even Babe Ruth couldn't hit a home run every time!

Very different game from [b]Patchwork[/b], and I'm very pleased to say that.  Both games are great, but I was worried this was just a 4-player version of the first: definitely not.  Beautiful, well-designed, and only slightly fiddly.  This one is a keeper!

:thumbsup: There is a very relaxing and calming mood, and the fact that it is impossible to lose makes it uplifting.
:thumbsup: The artwork and component quality are excellent, adding to the theme and the general feeling.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The garden path can sometimes be a little tricky to set up and manage as it meanders around.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The lightweight mechanics can be too relaxing and easy without a deep challenge to think through.

:thumbsdown: Each puzzle can feel a bit repetitive towards the end as nothing significant changes.
:thumbsdown: The number of unique tiles feels rather limited for how diverse cottage gardens truly are.

Short summary is I'd rather play patchwork.  Sure this supports more than 2 but it seems like the tile laying seemed to overstay it's welcome and it began to get tedious to lay down tiles over and over. Moving 3 cubes of each color also seemed to be very artificial and created choices, but not very interesting ones.

In the lines of Patchwork, jigsaw-like game to fill up patches of garden. A bit less involved a game than Patchwork although more thematic, but plays more that 2 players so will probably hit the table easier, equally easy to explain to non-gamers which makes it more approachable..

A light, mediocre tile placement game. Even though the game looks more complex than Patchwork, it's actually not. Filling up a small patches of land feels a bit unsatisfying compared to the big grids in Uwe's other tile-laying games. The scoring is unnecessarily convoluted, and the final round is the least exciting part of the game. I'd rather be playing Patchwork.

My first playthrough was lukewarm, there seems to be too many rules bogging down the game in comparison to Patchwork (its famous predecessor) which was more elegant. However with increasing amount of plays, it starts to distinguished itself as a completely different game and there's a satisfaction of completing as many flower beds you can. There is a depth to it that I only noted with repeated plays but essentially, it's a multiplayer solitaire. Plus point, it has polyominoes tile which was the main driving factor of me buying it in the first place.

First edition has some misprint on the game board and rule board which the publisher remedy with stickers to paste on. I barely notice it when playing the game but it was a hassle initially trying to make it game-ready.

Sadly, Patchwork is a much more superior game and this doesn't distinguish itself enough to deserve a place in my collection so it has to go.

Solid game for those that like drafting and placing tiles. Great theme for those that aren't big gamers or perhaps for your wife or mother. Even though you have some tough decisions at times, I can't say there is that much strategy involved. Still somewhat random. I think it would get boring after awhile. Finally, the MSRP is way too much. Only purchase if you can find it fro about half that.

I can't stand cats and the ecological destruction they wreak (at least here in Australia), so I made my own insect tokens to use instead. It actually makes more thematic sense that way too - build a nice garden and attract beneficial insects to your plot like bees and ladybugs. I adore playing this solo and find it very relaxing, but I'm hoping to convince my wife to play it with me more often as well. I agree with a lot of critics that Barenpark is the better tetris-puzzle game, but I'm keeping this one purely for theme. As a gardener myself, I'm building quite a lovely collection of gardening and farming-themed games, and Cottage Garden will always have a place in it.

RATING: 7
My wife and I love this one.  The game is relaxing enough, but there are certainly tense moments when a tile that is taken that ruins your next turn.  I find the scoring to be a bit unintuitive, and it took a bit of play time to get a grasp of it.  I feel that the game is a bit heavier than it appears on the surface, which is not surprising as this is a Rosenberg title.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.38
Hmmm based on first play, I prefer Patchwork. But that said, I consider Patchwork to be a tremendous game, arguably a modern classic, so that is a very high bar I am measuring it against!

 I am struggling to find the right word(s) but I feel Patchwork is a little more pure, cohesive, sleek, focused, neat, elegant. However, many a time I have thought, boy I wish we could do Patchwork with three players. Here is where Cottage Garden has its place for me.

The scoring seemed a little less transparent than with Patchwork, almost feeling like going a bit out of its way to be more complex in order to give you more to think about. But it certainly gets me thinking, how to time things better. It is neat that often you can look ahead and decide which tile you will likely take, which helps to reduce downtime.

For me it's not one of Uwe's top games, I almost feel like it could be someone else's game who ripped off Uwe, but it is a pleasant experience and I like the simple mental workout, a la Patchwork, of figuring out how the Tetris-like pieces will fit into my growing garden.

Rating may rise. What is for sure already is that I am happy to have it in the collection.

I'd heard it was Patchwork, but lighter and no time element. I think I liked it better than Patchwork and I'm not sure it is lighter. There felt like more I could do to plan future turns and maximize benefit. It's still a very light game about placing Tetris pieces. If you like Patchwork then Cottage Garden may be right up your alley. If you didn't like Patchwork, I doubt this will be a game for you.

Good but not great.  With 4 player, you will never access certain sections of the board.  While that makes planning easier, it also limits your possibilities.  

End game is also lackluster in that, if you're playing well, you will sit out the sixth round.  Lastly, as you can easily see everyone's scores, there is no mystery or tension as there is no end game scoring.

I'm not sure whether I like Patchwork or Cottage Garden more but I'd much rather play Bärenpark over either of them.

The closest you can currently get to a Patchwork-like experience for 3 or 4 players.  It is from the same designer, certainly.

People compare it to Patchwork, and that comparison may not 100% favourable. Patchwork is pretty short, simple, and straightforward, and by comparison Cottage Garden is a bit longer, with obscure scoring rules and nonsensical theming. It's also a really, really quiet and thinky experience -- noone's going to cheer or groan while playing this game.

Having said that, I really like it. In particular I like that you can plan ahead a few turns, much more effectively. The game is pretty and enjoyable. I've played this a few times now, with all player counts, and have enjoyed every game.

If I absolutely had to pick this or Bärenpark, gun to my head and gun to my nuts... I'd probably go with Bärenpark. That's a simply inspired, elegant game. This one's still extremely good, but definitely clumsier.

In a word, charming. A very pleasant wee game that plays quickly, offers some tricky choices most turns and doesn't overstay its welcome. And a lovely production job too - chunky tiles, beautifully illustrated, particularly the flowers (though the cats will be a bigger attraction for some) and an almost entirely unnecessary but rather lovely wheelbarrow which marks the start of the refill queue.

A simple tile-laying game of filling a grid with various shaped tiles, trying to leave specific spaces in that grid uncovered in order to earn points. There's a decent amount of planning ahead here that is possible due to the drafting system used for tiles, so it felt like you had a good amount of control over what tiles you got, with a little uncertainty thrown in as sometimes another player snagged a tile you wanted.

No real "twists" here to make a super interesting game, but it's a solid enough game.

Patchwork 2.0. Played 1 solo game of this but I think I am going to be a big fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Due to the nature of the game, there's very little look ahead (one turn max). It's really just about asking yourself, which of these two to four tiles is best for me right now? It's probably the biggest one, as that will help you to fill in your tiles fastest, but once one tile is nearly done, you start to need specific shapes to fill it in, so the biggest one might not be the right answer (this is where looking ahead one turn may help). The game doesn't have much bite though, as no decision ever really feels painful thanks to the presence of the pots. Also, while you are all taking from the same set of tiles, there isn't any interaction as your choice is unlikely to affect anyone anyways.

Very similar to Patchwork but I would prefer patchwork. The game is very peaceful to play. It just seems to lack something extra to give it more depth. Extremely light, choose a tile and configure it on the player board. Something I won't really seek out to play but will play if in the mood.

A pleasant game of using tetris pieces to complete gardens and score points for the flower pots and plant covers you leave uncovered. The mechanic in this is very simple as you simply move around a 4x4 grid to collect a piece from that row and place it in your garden. The gimmick here is more in how you score points since you have 3 markers for each scoring type and you can only move one with each completed garden. As you move a marker up the track you get various bonuses and since you cant split the points you score you don't want to lose too many to get to that 20 point space. It's a good game, but with 2 players I'd rather play patchwork. I feel I need something a bit in between this and A Feast for Odin, I am hoping Indian Summer is it.

Multiplayer Patchwork, less tight and a little more forgiving, accessible with an attractive and solid production. The way flower patches are selected makes tile availability somewhat predictable while leaving some room for uncertainty.

Nice little zen-like game for the first 4 rounds, but once round 4 starts, you really need to start planning ahead.  When round 5 comes to a close, you start to lose points for every turn that you take in which you have not completed all of your gardens.  There are still a lot of points to be made in that last round if you play it right, or you can plan ahead so that you never even enter the final round and not risk any of your potential points.  Fun game, with light strategy.  Nice to spend 45 minutes doing.

It's repetitive... but in a way that I actually found kind of pleasurable.   You are working on filling in two simultaneous grids.   The Patchwork lineage is quite obvious, although the direct interaction and competitiveness is less here.   Uwe Rosenberg is a designer who basically gets away with murder these days - he is able to publish incremental designs.   This is an increment to Patchwork (or a decrement, depending on your POV).  Caverna was Agricola 2.0.   Ora&Labora is Le Harve 2.0.   Each Bohnanza increment gets published.  A few other big names can get away with this too - Wallace, Moon, Knizia.   I guess that's when you know that you've arrived.   Whatever.  Anyway, Cottage Garden is enjoyable to play.  It falls into that casual "comfort" game category for me, like Don Quixote or Hanging Gardens.   If you want more competition and challenge, then Patchwork is the better choice.

Patchwork, by the same designer as Cottage Garden, is a wonderful 2-player tetris-style shape placing game with a double economy of time and buttons. Cottage Garden is also a shape-placing game and unlike its predecessor will play up to 4 players. But is it as good as Patchwork? Not from my perspective. Cottage Garden is more of the shape puzzle bit but without the interesting dynamics that makes Patchwork so interesting.

In Cottage Garden you are placing shapes on your own personal flower bed, a 5x5 grid. You need to avoid covering up the scoring spaces with the shapes. You choose the shape to place from the central board, which is a 4x4 grid holding one shape per space. Scoring is done according to the number of the two different scoring spaces remaining uncovered on your flower bed. 

This feels very similar to Patchwork, but the main difference, and it is an important one, is that the income and payment mechanic, which makes Patchwork so clever, distinctive and interesting, is absent here. There is a scoring track which gives some decision making, but not of the tactical level as that in Patchwork.

My family and myself enjoyed Cottage Garden, as did another gamer I played with. It is an engaging shape-filling puzzle exercise. But everyone agrees it is not as good a game as the predecessor. If there was no Patchwork in existence I would be far more positive. But there is. So really the main reason to play this over Patchwork is for the multi-player capabilities of the game. And on that basis it is recommended as a simple family puzzle-game.

Recommended as a relaxed shape-fitting sunday afternoon family puzzle game, to be played when there are too many players for its better older sibling.

SOLD IT! ($40)

We bought Cottage Garden in hopes of finding another Patchwork game, sadly the kittens and the great theme could not elevate this one beyond just being OK. The decisions on what tiles to take is almost automatic (just grab the biggest one available), there is no real long term planning, the spatial placing element is superfluous (you rarely have any issues), and the real sticking point is the redundancy of having to complete your little gardens over and over and over...

Normally I would say it is a game to not buy and just play elsewhere once, but this was so forgettable, I'd just skip it entirely.

Cottage Garden appears to be a hasty and ill-conceived re-work of Rosenberg's Patchwork (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163412/patchwork).  Cumbersome new mechanisms are overlaid on the simple engine of the earlier design.  Theme integration is weak; gardeners score for empty pots and have artificially restricted choice of flowers to plant; successful gardeners are rewarded with cats (yes, cats).  Game overstays its welcome by about 30 minutes.  On top of everything else, a flower game with ugly art IMHO, though my wife thinks it's beautiful.  Playing boards, AKA "Flower beds" an unpleasant brown more appropriate to a game about sewage treatment facilities than to a game about gardening.  

If you want to play a game about planting flowers, I recommend Garden Competition (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12188/garden-competition) instead.

See my review: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1854091/

The bottom line: "Uwe Rosenberg's Cottage Garden is a great follow-up to Patchwork, but should be considered as much more than just Patchwork 2.0 or a multiplayer Patchwork. While it relies on a same basic mechanic underlying the gameplay, there are also many changes that make it feel very different. Not least, the theme has moved us from the sewing table to our garden bed, and the fine components help generate a very light and fun atmosphere that suits the game well. Certainly the game-play now goes beyond just the two-player experience, and being able to play solo or with as many as four players will be a boon to many. But the elimination of Patchwork's `button economy', plus a different scoring system makes Cottage Garden feel independent from its predecessor. In some respects it also reduces some of the book-keeping and creates a more relaxing experience, without stripping the game of meaningful choices that make it fun. Accessible for a wide variety of people, and readily suitable as a family game, Cottage Garden is a game that is going to have a broad reach."

RATING: 3
This game is pretty good looking, I must say. However, that's about the only good thing about it. There's very little strategy, no meaningful choices, and a lot of repetition. On top of that, when you score one of your garden tiles, you just throw it away and begin a new one from scratch, which takes every sense of satisfaction and completion out of the game. Overall, this one feels like "dumbed down" Patchwork more than an advanced version of the other game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The drafting and scoring mechanics/system is cleverly designed. It grew on me through my first play, but not enough to be totally convinced. I have the feeling that whatever you do, you get +/-50 points. You never get this "Wow, how clever I am" feeling. Maybe the puzzle is too simple? I didn't like the end game, where you get minus points for not finishing, and those who finish up only takes one-square pieces to fill up. Just an ok game from Uwe this time. I think Patchwork is more tense, although it's way overrated, in my opinion. Conclusion: Feast for Odin is the best Tetris game by Uwe, but it's hard to compare heavy games with light games, of course:)

Some similarity to the 2-player game Patchwork,  rules take longer to teach, and scoring more complicated.  There are some cute components & I enjoyed the game.  However the end game is lacking since it is easy to end up with your 2 boards practically empty with no possibility of filling them due to the limited turns left.  Therefore in our game, for 3 out of 4 of the players, we just grabbed tiles for several rounds to pass time while the 4th member worked to complete a board.  I would play it again because I like puzzles, but not interested in owning it due to that end game problem.

Bárki bármit is mond, azért ez nem más mint egy feltúrbozott, többszemélyes patchwork. Gyönyörű a kivitelezés, a cicás ötlet különösen tetszik. Kár, hogy elnyomták a táblát, reméljük javítják a későbbi nyomásokban, mert a matricás megoldás elég nyomorult.  Jópofa ez a "nem szabad lefedni" mechanika, de elsőre úgy tűnt, hogy a táblák között nagy különbségek tudnak lenni nehézségben. Illetve nekem még fura volt ez a hat kockás pontozás. Nem teljesen éreztem létjogosultságát annak, hogy többet is toljak, mivel a cicák közel se jelentenek akkora előnyt, mint a trekk végi plusz pontok. De ezeket ki kell még ismerni, mert egy játék után azért nem tuti, hogy jól éreztem.

Cottage Garden is the love-child of Patchwork and FITS. Less intricate and challenging than the former, less solitary and more involved than the latter it falls square in the middle of its two progenitors on many of the relevant axes.

When my partner bought Cottage Garden in a game store I was rather concerned, because neither the title nor the cover were particularly appealing. Fortunately, it turned out to be an excellent choice. The components are really good and both the mechanics and the theme are quite original. You basically place tiles like Tetris in order to score points. I find this game relaxing and stress free, mainly because of the theme. When we play winning is not as important as in other games, what matters is the sense of achievement when you complete a bed.

Expanded Patchwork so it would work for 1-4 instead of just 2 and brought along pros and cons. It's great to have a more flexible player count and the tweaks to the market are really clever and bring along cool new decisions to make. Plus, it allows for planning. 
The main negative point for me is that once a garden is complete it instantly goes away for points and is replaced with a new one. You lose a sense of spatial accomplishment at the end - other than the points.

Another tetrisque tile laying game in the vein of Patchwork. This one is more relaxed because there's no economic aspect and you can be more liberal with the tiles because you'll get two boards to fill and new ones when you're done.  Patchwork is meatier and more elegant, but the fact that this goes up to 4 players and has cats is just great. Also the theme is lovely. (9.3.2017)

Interesting scoring mechanics. Will need few more games to wrap my head around it. [No preview mentioned that score track is missing some numbers, so it's even more important to make that final jump to 20 pts. This is in contrast with "cat" influx you want to keep and also getting that extra flower pot at the good time can be critical] I LIKE IT A LOT [and awesome theme helps, of course]

I definitely enjoy this game, but there is one thing that I do not like, namely: the post-round-6 phase where everyone who has a somewhat-completed garden gets as many chances to complete them as is necessary...on their own! Oh sure, they lose a nominal amount of points per turn that they're not completed, but so far in the games I've played, these "negative points" haven't been much of a deterrent. IMO it would be a lot cooler if that wasn't part of the game, and that players were rewarded for what they had accomplished by the end of round 6 w/o this extra "completion" phase, but I still find the game quite enjoyable and will continue attempting to maximize how I play it.

Light gardening themed, puzzle-style game. It's a race to put together as many flower-bed tableaus as possible by essentially drafting tiles that need to be assembled onto square boards. Interesting points mechanism and good production values.

The first edition comes with some misprints that affect the board and English rules (there are correction stickers distributed with each copy of the game).

The adorable factor of all the art and pieces is what pushes this above a 7 in terms of score.

2017-07-10 - I'm not going to rate this yet, because I only played a quick demo, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's a fun, casual tetris puzzle that is easy to teach. Plus, it has cats!

2017-08-28 - I've played a full game now, and was not surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's a great light puzzle game, and is pretty much exactly what you think it is. If Tetris puzzles appeal to you, this is a no-brainer.

Very nice streamlined polyomino placing game. I would play again almost any time!

True it is so simple, but there is actually a surprising amount of planning that you can do. I think I prefer its more pure puzzle aspect when compared to something like Patchwork (which I have played over 1500 times on the app). The scoring system gives it just enough character to make it challenging without requiring too much mental gymnastics. Lovely game!

I'm a big fan of Patchwork so I was really looking forward to trying this one. In Cottage Garden players race to complete many garden beds and score them. Each turn players draft a flower tile of various Tetris-like shapes and place them on their beds, hoping not to cover up scoring spaces. Instead of drafting a flower tile, players can take a single-space point tile. Players also have cats that they can use to help fill their beds or replenish tiles to draft without using an action.

The first half of the game almost brainlessly progresses as you take the best-fitting tiles available to you and score your beds as quickly and completely as possible. When a bed is filled, it is replaced by another. There are two kinds of points - orange and blue - and for most tiles you will progress along both score tracks. Score tracks are on individual player boards and both colors jump from 15/16 to 20 points, so it is worth getting to the end to make the jump. Each scoring track has 3 scoring cubes and when you score you pick one cube of each color to move. I've never seen anything like it. Basically you are trying to balance your scoring opportunities between cubes to get to 20 without wasting points and maximizing your cats, which you get more of each time a scoring cube crosses a red line. It's a bit clunky, but it works. 

The rules of the game change a bit in the final round and preparing for these changes is basically your focus for the second half of the game. First, when round 6 starts, beds without at least 3 flower tiles are removed and cannot be scored. Then at the beginning of every turn, players start to lose 2 points. So the longer you spend completing a bed, the more you lose, and eventually still having beds in the sixth round ends up hurting rather than helping. So you either want to time completing your beds at the end of the 5th round and make that your last move or time your remaining beds so that they don't accrue too much damage before completing. This can take some planning to do well and almost creates a different sort of game than the one played at the beginning. Although I enjoy the tile-laying I find that the timing aspect of the end doesn't really capture my interest like I had hoped. The game is fine, but I can't register a stronger reaction than just that.

RATING: 7
Fast game with a fun theme. Nothing spectacular, but pretty good. The rulebook explains how you can plan ahead, but honestly, I didn't find that APing for such a light game to be appealing. Shifting the tiles is also annoying, since you keep putting tiles in the back, so you run out of table space.

RATING: 6.5
Relaxing game which almost feels like a bit of solitaire tetris to me. Don't really mind if I win or lose, I just want to complete my gardens!

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed my play of this. The spatial puzzle is fun, you want to grab the largest pieces possible, but you need to avoid crushing those precious point scoring pots. The drafting of tiles gives you just enough information about the next couple of turns to allow you to do a bit of planning. 

The butting of heads in the tile draft provides the only bit of interaction. You need to predict what others will want in order to plan your turns properly. There are often groans as a tile someone was eyeing is taken by a player to their right. If you need a lot of interaction in your games this probably won't be enough to satisfy you, but it was enough for me.

The comparison to [thing=163412][/thing] is impossible to ignore. Cottage Garden has the feature of playing up to 4, however at 2 I would usually choose Patchwork instead. Mostly due to the time track and button income mechanisms which I really love. The decision of pacing in Patchwork is also quite agonizing, you need to be aware of what you're leaving your opponent. Cottage Garden is a little more easy going, there are fewer things for you to juggle, there is more of an emphasis on planning your own board, and less on concerning yourself with your opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Less challenging and deep than its smaller predecessor Patchwork. Thus, scores will be very close. I'm not sure if there are hidden subtleties that could elevate Cottage Garden to the next level. Cottage Garden's advantages are the more flexible player count and the more relaxing gameplay. As a gaming buddy said: "A double date game". It's designed to be a casual feelgood game.

it's like patchwork but enough different, so for me it's not a expension but rather a sequel. You score differently and for me it's a bit lighter. Don't know if i prefer Patchwork or cottage garden when playing with 2 players. ( played only once so far, with 3 players) 
One BIG MINOR thing ( for that rating will go down by 1 point till the problem is solved) I bought my copy at essen and they solved the typos by stickers by themself, but by doing that they really ruined the gameboard quit a bit! stickers are over the board, one over the other, that's such a pitty!!!!!

Szép grafika, hangulatos kivitelezés. A mechanika kevésbé elegáns, mint a Patchworkben, de azért gyorsan emészthető. Alapvetően jó móka, de kettesben nem vetélytársa az elődnek. Nagy előnye, hogy 3-4-en is játszhatják, illetve szóló mód is van. Szóval mindenféleképpen van helye a társasjátékpalettán, de nem kiemelkedő alkotása Rosenbergnek. Az mindenféleképpen örömteli, hogy megjelent magyarul!

I like patchwork. And  was hoping for some multiplayer patchwork goodness.
Instead the fixed gamelength means it is anything but patchwork.
Sure there are some similarities but this is uninspired and I am amazed that A prolific designer was happy enough to bring this out. There is am audience for this. Thise that like puzzle games. but there really is not much to it. 
Game explanation after playing it once or after some preparation should take two minutes or less. There is not s lot of depth here. amd when played confrontational.. counting tiles and movement studying other player boards it takes way too long.
So in the end you begin playing suboptimal. (not considering influence on other players)
This in huge contrast with patchwork. 
This also means table seating is important.. 
If one player will block. this means he loses out on some points and the player to his left will lose more points.. Meaning that player will probably not block and still get as many points as he can. Leaving the third player an easy choice. Not block as well.. since the other is okay with giving a few points here and there.
Scores are close and often the player first in turnorder will win the tiebreaker. 
Hives often go to the first player.
those hives count as two extra points and decide tiebreaker in their advantage. 
Its a huge advantage for the first player.
Tiebreaker most filled player board in front of you would be better imo. 

This rambling just shows how much i prefer patchwork over this game.

Judgement on first play in a 2 player game is that I would rather play Patchwork. This lacked the scope, depth and planning of Patchwork and although I appreciate that this is probably better as a 3 or 4 player game I really cannot see it having any greater depth at those levels. This is a light breezy game giving a feeling of control but in all honesty I think you just take the best of what has been left each turn.  
I was left unimpressed with printing errors on both the board and in the rules, also their use of the word "plant cover" to mean "cloche" throughout the rules which was confusing when they talked about you scoring points for plant cover when they meant a cloche as opposed to the plant cover provided by the flower beds, oddly enough they use the word cloche on the back cover of the box!!!

Go figure! This isn't as well designed than the original 'Patchwork' AND scoring is more fiddly AND components aren't perfect either.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Lighter than Patchwork, this one is a bit more easygoing and fun in nature although the spatial aspect can still lead to aggravating decisions. I'm almost certain the key timing aspect in this game is being prepared for the final round and having your garden(s) still available to finish quickly. Easily taught, easily played, this should easily be a family game of choice.

Ein Puzzlespiel. Wer an der Reihe ist, nimmt sich ein Puzzleteil aus der aktiven Reihe und versucht es in seinen Garten einzubauen, möglichst so, dass keine Blumentöpfe überdeckt werden. Wenn der Garten komplett bepflanzt ist, wird dieser gewertet und man erhält Punkte. Der nächste Spieler sucht sich dann aus der nachfolgenden Reihe ein Teil aus und setzt es in seinen Garten, usw.
Man kann mit der zur Verfügung stehenden Plättchenwahl schon sehr viel Pech haben. Wenn man aber 2 Züge in die Zukunft plant, wird das schon minimiert. Sehr wichtig empfand ich die Pflanzglocken, die ein einzelnes Feld bedecken und bei der Wertung 2 Punkte einbringen. Im Spiel kam ich nur ein einziges mal dazu eine solche Glocke zu nehmen. Aber gewinnen kann man auch offensichtlich auch ohne diese (wobei eine der Glocken ausschlaggebend für den Sieg war. Nur eine weniger und es wären 5 Punkte weniger gewesen).

Dies ist leider nicht mein Spiel... Puzzeln nicht meine Mechanik und Gärtnern nicht mein Thema. Es funktioniert gut, das ist aber auch alles was ich sagen möchte ;)

Der Spielmechnismus funktioniert super, aber Patchwork gefällt mir besser (ist aber leider nur zu zweit spielbar, dafür aber planbarer, warscheinlich weil nur zu zweit spielbar...).

RATING: 9
It's pretty harsh to label this the Patchwork killer, but I think it's the better game, and I like it more than Patchwork. Its ability to scale for players is a godsend, and it basically took an incredible game mechanic that was confined for 2 players and made it accessible to a large amount of people. What I really like about this game is the multiple avenues you have to go about everything, and how the randomness doesn't impact who wins the game, certainly not as much as Patchwork. I keep comparing it to Patchwork when I know they're fundamentally different games, but Patchwork to me is a phenomenal game that I really wished was more than 2p, and now it essentially is, minus the currency and wait times but with the addition of a non-currency scoring mechanic and TWO boards to maintain. I think it's one of those games where Uwe looked at what he had (see Caverna, Feast for Odin) and just said "I know, I'll just add this and this, and I'll make it better!" (or in Caverna's case, the same but more open). Great work, never doubt the power of the Uwe.

First Impression:
Love the game, the way turns are structured is elegant, the selection of pieces is highly strategic. My biggest complaint would be that there's quite a bit of different rules to juggle when scoring a garden patch, this is a minor quip as other than that the game flows elegantly.
One of my favorite things is how the game ends, it incentivizes players to finish their plots quickly as possible. I love how there are two different score tracks to manage and the ability to chain the scoring of gardens with highly strategic play is really rewarding.

Almost no interaction, no resource management, no tension, very far from being as unforgiving as Patchwork.

Good game for playing with my parents or parents in law. Creates a cosy vibe around the table.

The scoring mechanism is nice. Do you go for 1 cube reaching 20 as soon as possible, or do you try to get multiple cats/jokers with multiple cubes.

When explaining, I explain the basics first, play 4 rounds and then explain how the final round (6) works, they still have round 5 to set themselves up for a good final round that way. Non-gamers get overwhelmed about the final round rules if you explain those at the start.

My wife played and liked it well enough to send me after it at Essen '16.  Got one of the last copies there, with the minor printing error.  Plays easily and fast.  Pleasant, less cut-throat than Patchwork.  Cute discs with the cats!  Will play when my wife requests.

One of those zen style games that is very pleasant but not mentally taxing. This is specifically less strategic, less interactive than Patchwork, and for me it brings little to the table while being solidly unobjectionable.

A pleasant Tetris exercise with a semi-predictable rondel mechanism for picking the tiles to place. This allows both planning and an opportunity to adapt to/screw other players. The end game is a game in itself, requiring good timing to avoid negative points. I haven't played Cottage Garden's predecessor Patchwork but appreciate the ability to play with more than 2 players.

A good game, certainly a step up from Patchwork in terms of gameplay. It can induce a little AP in play as you work out what pieces you can use and what is coming up, but a lot of the "blocked" moves can be alleviated by the use of the flower pots or cats to complete a garden.

The use of multiple scoring cubes is an interesting scoring mechanism that encourages different plays of each garden board.

Good game even if the theme is a little artificial (why are empty pots the most common way of earning points in the game?) It's also not entirely clear what you should be doing (a shortcoming of Patchwork as well) and the math to figure out the best move can be tedious and lead to AP.

After a few plays: I do really enjoy the puzzly aspect of this and surprisingly the scoring is almost another puzzle to maxime the actual points you're getting out. 
I can't not compare this to Patchwork though and while it is nice that this plays also with more, with 2 I think I'd pick Patchwork over this one every time, just because the currency and timing thing is more interesting there.

[b]Cottage Garden[/b] was sold via auction 3/25/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8 -> [b]6[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Cottage Garden stuck around for a few more plays and then left our collection. To begin with I still much prefer the more challenging experience found in Patchwork, in part because I prefer working on one larger board as opposed to the small boards found in Cottage Garden. I also enjoy balancing the button economy in PAtchwork; there just wasn't enough of a challenge in Cottage Garden to keep me interested. The final nail in the coffin was the release of [thing=219513]Barenpark[/thing] which offers a much more fun multiplayer, Tetris style game. Barenpark is also a great kids game that has a much more engaging theme [i](your building bear exhibits for a zoo)[/i] Also, similar to Patchwork, you are laying pieces on one board which expands as the game progresses. 

All in all I found Cottage Garden to be a ho hum experience and had no problem culling it from the collection. My recommendation goes to Barenpark if you are looking for a family weight, Tetris style game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm still not sure how I feel about Cottage Garden. Every time I've played I've enjoyed it, it's a much lighter version of Patchwork since there isn't an economy to manage (the buttons in Patchwork). With that missing the game is a very breezy experience as you only focus on filling in your garden as efficiently as possible. There is some forward planning since you know what tiles you'll be able to choose from on future turns. There is a somewhat interesting scoring mechanic, but nothing earth shattering. 

So I'm not sure where that leaves me in regards to my desire to continue playing Cottage Garden. On the one hand I enjoy the laid back experience of playing, including the beautiful artwork. On the other hand I can't help comparing it to Patchwork, which I much prefer. I'm curious to see if the game changes the more we play and if our scores start improving (we seem to be stuck in the 70's right now). For now it'll stick around and see more play, in large part because my kids prefer it to Patchwork. I'll be curious to see how this game fares a year from now.[/i]

So each turn you're offered a choice of different set of shaped pieces to fit on one of your two personal boards, and generally you choose the biggest shape you can that will cover the most empty spaces without covering up the scoring spaces, a la FITS, whilst leaving empty spaces in a pattern that are likely coverable later with a minimum number of pieces. Repeat for turn after turn, round after round. That's it. There's no sense of critical decision making, or fun making. You enter a game-auto-trance, a la Flowerpower, and eventually come out of it but only after the game takes waaaay longer than it merits. I was expecting something more interesting given the author, but it felt like other games, only without the things that make them worthy, and came away disappointed.

On first glance and some investigation, we thought it would replace Patchwork - similar mechanics and scoring and could play from 2 to 4.  Neat!  After the first play, we were not so sure, and think that there is justification for keeping both, and are not sure if we are very keen on how the final round works.  Still a good enough game and warrants further investigation.

Unfortunately not in my wheelhouse. It did simply not invoke a feeling of "fun" or of accomplishment, as the entire game was centered around completing a garden and taking another garden tile. At the end, I was left with a feeling of that this was the only thing I was doing in the game, exchanging garden tiles. The cats are cute and overall artwork is nice though.

Easier than Patchwork, but much longer. Too long in my opinion for such an easy game. If you play 1 full round less you will not miss anything, but is it the way it should be?
In my opinion also the player boards are not balanced well. By design they give different number of points, so players with better boards can get more points while others can just watch this to happen.

RATING: 9
Although I prefer the outstanding Patchwork to this at two players, the fact that this allows me to play a Patchwork-type game with three or four players is very welcome. It's also different enough from the game which inspired it to stand on its own, and the tile selection and scoring mechanisms both work very nicely, as does having two boards to complete at any given time. Perhaps if this had been released first, it would hold the very special place in my affections currently reserved for Patchwork, but it's nonetheless a fantastic game I'm very happy to have in my collection and play regularly.

I was pretty excited for this one. Lots of buzz at Essen and after. When I played 2p it wasn't as exciting as I was hoping. reminds me of Patchwork but with less tension.

In this game, you move a marker in a circle, and then select a tetris piece from your row and place it on one of your two player boards. The boards have two different scoring features printed on them, so ideally you want to try not to cover those spots, but you might have to if it means completing a board so you get a new board, and score those points. This game is interesting, as the boards are more or less have one of two different arrangements of pre printed scoring items. You wind up completing a lot of boards which feels pretty dynamic. You also have a lot of perfect information, as you can see which rows you'll get to pull from in what order, and if you need to refill, you'll see the order the tiles will refill from. In each of my three plays I've scored between 72 and 76 points, which makes me wonder how much real strategy there is to playing the game, but when I did my 2 player session my wife wound up in the low 60s, so there's definitely right and wrong choices to make in the game.

So far I've enjoyed this over Patchwork because it allows for more players, looks nicer, and being able to complete multiple boards is more exciting and fulfilling than trying and failing to complete just one. I've also enjoyed this over Barenpark, because while this game is a race to the finish certainly, it doesn't have as much of the unpleasantly stressful element of each player who scores before you scores better points by virtue of being first.

I'm not really sure about this one. I got it because a couple of play throughs of Patchwork last year made me want a game with some of the same spacial elements. Since this game came with solo rules right out of the box this is what I got.
In this game, however, the garden plots are so small that there really isn't that much puzzling going on.
The game box is quite a bit bigger than I had anticipated - not a plus point in my book for a game I bought, clearly without researching very much beforehand. Perhaps getting Patchwork, or going all out and getting Feast for Odin, would have been smarter. However, I'm not going to give up on the game just yet. Just not sure I love the solo rules as they are. Need to play more but seem to find myself wanting to play something else instead.

I was never going to play this game...until I had the chance to pick it up for really cheap. I'm glad I did! I was hoping for something closer to Patchwork, when I started seeing info for the game but was let down when I realized there was no currency or economic portion to the game. Watching a few videos did not help me to see some of the smaller, yet vital, decisions that need to be made to win the game, and those are what makes the game. It's very light, but offers some tough decisions and timing choices that will make or break your game. I also love that it plays four players.

Peaceful and pleasing to look at and relaxing to play. We played multiple games of Patchwork alongside Cottage Garden and Patchwork pretty much wins across the board in all areas (since we'll likely only ever play Cottage Garden with two players) but at least for now there's a place for it in our collection.Especially because of all the cats! Maybe we can have a laid-back game night where we just play Cottage Garden and Herbaceous.

Also, some of the pieces don't quite fit together and that's really annoying.

This game makes me unreasonably, irrationally, insanely HAPPY!!!

It's so beautiful and relaxing.  Cats curled up in the garden, gorgeous flowers, tranquil ponds, and tea ready to be served on the patio table.  What more could one want?

And the strategy of looking ahead to see what tiles will be available in future turns as well as the variety of scoring options keeps it interesting.  Not that I actually care whether I win or lose.  Seeing my beautiful gardens come together is fully satisfying in itself.

I have the Android app, which is absolutely perfect, but I also want to buy the board game so that I can bring it to the table (and have a 3D wheelbarrow!).

A light, clean puzzle-like game by same makers of Patchwork and Agricola. It stretches its simplicity past the point where I'm satisfied with simple placement. I'd prefer Patchwork for a light game or something more involved for a step up in complexity - like having meaning behind what I'm planting. Still fun though and you gotta love the wheelbarrow!

An awesome fellow geek picked this game up for me at Essen. I love the look of this game and that it uses Patchwork mechanics with up to 4 players. 

The epitome of board gaming relaxation. It is not as thinky as Patchwork and way lighter but man, feels soo good to play. This will become one of the best gateway games of all time I think. Gifted it to a good friend.

I'm unsure as to which I prefer, Patchwork or Cottage Garden. Each has their strengths, this was the game I ran to at Essen Spiel 16! It was well worth the run, I even enjoy this solo. I feel like this is patchwork 2.0 with more players! 

13.08.17 I'm currently enjoying Patchwork more. Although, this is the 4 player equivalent that I enjoy with my family. 

31.10.2017 Patchwork trounces this, cottage garden just feels dull and boring, an almost therapeutic experience. But one that at two players, we don't enjoy.

Solid puzzle tile laying game that just overstays its welcome by a bit. I think it plays pretty fast but can drag a little near the last 2 rounds. Mechanics are solid and some nice tension heading into that final round. I think I still prefer patchworks and indian summer over it.

I don't usually get on with spatial games, but this one goes out of its way to be friendly whilst still having a few quirky aspects that require a bit of calculation.  I especially liked the tile selection mechanism which allowed planning and some risk-taking.  The only real failing is the continual turnover of gardens, meaning that you don't really end up with anything "pretty" at the end, which is a shame.

Cottage Garden is designed to be pleasant. It's not designed to be particularly competitive, or to have interesting strategy. I enjoyed playing it, and I wouldn't mind playing it again if someone asks, but I'm more interested in games with more compelling strategy and tactics. I like both A Feast for Odin and Patchwork quite a bit more because I find the strategy and tactics more interesting in both of those games.

I have a blast playing this puzzle game and the theme does not bug me at all, I grab a tile or grab a pot and you are just trying to fill in your garden plots like tetris, it gives you a nice feeling when you finish however there is close to no player interaction but for some reason it does not bug me much with this game.

Not just Patchwork for more than 2. The only resemblance for me is the spacial awareness and the shapes... that’s it.

Cottage Garden is just mainly about filling up your boards as quickly and efficiently as possible by choosing a tile from the ones on the board in the appropriate row to score points. It also has nice bonus cat tokens that you can use to help fill awkward little spaces left in your gardens. I really like the scoring system of this one as well, where you can choose which scoring cubes to move.

Certainly different enough from Patchwork to warrant owning both.

Wifey approved.

Uwe többjátékosította és kicsi színt vitt a Patchworkbe a Cottage Gardent megalkotva. Kertünkbe virágokat ültetünk ügyelve rá, hogy a cserepeket és "üvegburákat" ne takarjuk le a különböző alakú virágágyásokkal, amiket egy központi tábláról veszünk, amiben mátrixszerűen helyezkednek el. Itt teljesen kiszámítható, hogy mikor ránk kerül a sor melyik oszlopból, sorból vagy átlóból tudunk majd választani, így menet közben is lehet némiképp gondolkodni. Tetszett emellett, hogy két területen ültetünk egyszerre és a pontszámítás módja. Mikor egy területünkön csak cserepek és vödrök látszanak a virágok mellett, akkor kiértékeljük azt, a cserepek darabjaiért 1, míg a vödrök 2 érnek. De van 3-3 kockánk, amivel léphetünk a pontozósávon. A csel, hogy a pontozósávok végén van egy-egy nagyobb értékű lépés, viszont ha többet lépnénk, akkor az a pont elveszik. Illetve a pontozókockák menet közben macskákat érnek, amik a Patchworkben a foltok voltak, azaz 1x1-es területet lehet velük lefedni méghozzá akció nélkül. Így megfontolandó melyik kockával lépünk. Érdekes a játék vége is. Fix 5 kör után a hatodik addig tart, míg mindenki be nem fejezi a már legalább három ágyással elkezdett kertjét. Minden plusz lépése az után, hogy valaki befejezte -2 pontba fáj. Minden új ötlet jó, a játék jól működik, mégis valahogy ehhez a mechanikához nekem az egyszerűen letisztult Patchwork illik jobban két személyre.

This is the 4-player version of Patchwork. It's got a little more going on, but borrows the puzzle-filling aspect. It still plays pretty quickly despite supporting four players nicely. 

Here, there's a shared grid where the tiles are placed. The remaining tiles are placed around the board in a Supply. On your turn, advance the marker around the outer edge to the next row/column/diagonal. If that line has only 1 token, refill from Supply. Then, choose any tile and place it on your player board. If you fill it completely (preprinted pot or cup icons considered filled), score it: advance one of 3 orange tokens as many spaces as pots, and one of 3 blue tokens as many spaces as cups. The blue track spaces increase in value more quickly. Whenever a token crosses a marked line, take a cat token (these may be used as a free action to fill a spot on your board). 

The game ends after 6 trips of the marker around the board. On the 6th round, you LOSE points (move a scoring token back 2 spaces) if you have an incomplete board. When everyone finishes their boards, score according to the positions of all your scoring tokens. Most VP wins!

Fun game!

This is basically a more involved version of Uwe Rosenberg's other game, Patchwork.  It works much in the same way where players take turns picking tiles from a selection that look like tetris pieces and are used to fill in a personal grid.  There are a few more rules here than with Patchwork, there are fill-in pieces you can use, cats you can "spend" to give yourself more options, there is a tiered scoring system, and once you fill in a grid and score you get a new one.

The game is very pretty but I was a little underwhelmed by Patchwork and found a lot of faults in it.  This corrects some of those issues but what you're left with a still reasonably uninspired abstract game.

RATING: 6
I kind of misunderstood how this game played out and thought the only thing that really made it interesting was the final round you build towards, but once we got to the final round, we re-read the rules to make sure it was done correctly and when I realized I had misunderstood, it kind of killed my interest in the game. I would rather play Patchwork which I think is a superior game but this isn't bad. Played with four people and it felt like it over-stayed its welcome. Patchwork at two moves quickly and isn't too repetitive.

A great simple gamevwhich feels rwlaxing. That is exactly the situation I want for this game - winding down after a hard day at work, just focusing on my little tetris puzzle and enjoying if it fits together nicely.

It's similar to Patchwork, but I like this one a little better for a few reasons. 
1. It can be played with up to 4 (instead of just 2). 
2. For me, it's easier to see exactly which pieces I will have to work with. 
3. It seems to move faster.
4. I don't know if it bothers anyone else, but I never seem to actually complete my quilt in Patchwork--it drives me crazy. At least in Cottage Garden I get the satisfaction of finishing at least a few gardens--even if I have to stuff a cat in there...

tl;dr: enjoyable puzzle

I haven't played [thing=163412][/thing], mainly because it's a 2 player only game. But I heard it was good, so when this multi player evolution of it came out, it went on my radar.
It's pretty basic: choose a playing piece from a given row and put it on one of your boards. Create a puzzle to most efficiently fill your board and score points. There are of course ways to score more or less, so it's not just a matter of filling the boards, it's also how you fill them.
It's not deep at all, but it is very enjoyable and doesn't take that long.
Good stuff.

Great game. However ignore those comparing this directly to patchwork, they are totally different games. Just because they have the same tile laying doesn’t make them a replacement for each other.

Well, first things first. It's no Patch (on Patchwork) with the churning of garden tiles lacking the significance of the single tile in Patchwork and the rotation around the board removing the all-important dual currencies. The scoring for the pots and ... water things(?) was nice though, but it didn't compare favourably to Patchwork.

And what a shame with the printing errors on the board, though the provided stickers were a decent solution. It's perfectly good and I enjoyed it, but it really does pale in comparison to Patchwork.

Tetris in a garden. I like a description I heard: like Patchwork, with up to 4 players, and without the pain of not having enough buttons. Very nice theme and artwork. Could play this easily with family as well as more experienced gamers. Not much player interaction or take-that, other some possible 'denial' by taking the tile that someone else may have needed. This is a gentle game.

This is a more forgiving game than Patchwork and expand the player counts up to 4. I played it once in 2016 and find it slightly different than Patchwork. It uses the basic same mechanic such as patching your plot, but other than that the scoring, the selection of the garden patch, etc are all different. I don't think it's fair to compare the two games. I certainly want to get the game in my collection some time in the future. It's certainly worth keeping both Patchwork and Cottage Garden in my collection.

Patchwork can be really vicious, while Cottage Garden seems more mellow. But the venom is at its tail, with the final turns costing 2VP each. It’s all about maneuvering yourself in the position that you can get those pieces you need, and more important: your opponent can’t. 

Lovely game. But I think I like Indian Summer better, because there’s a fox in the box.

One play at BGG.con and a second play one week later.

We played one of the rules wrong at BGG.con (we played that you lost points every round on turn six regardless of any other factor) so I was looking forward to playing again. 

I really enjoy this game. Smooth, fun spacial/puzzle aspect (apparently a favorite mechanic of mine) and some nice tactical decision making as you look forward to the pieces that will be available in future turns. 

On the flip side, having to sticker the rules and board really bothers me and I'm not a big fan of the artwork in general. I wish it would have been brighter, more vibrant, and more cartoony (think cell shaded artwork like cartoons). I think I'd like to own a copy as it's a fairly short game (45m - 90m is my sweet spot) and handles 2P very well (my typical game group size). That said, I think I'll likely wait for a corrected edition and something that doesn't require importing ($25-30 feels about right; far less than the $50 required for import copies).

Gentle tile drafting game with a light spatial element and a bit of a race to grab the beehive scoring bonus.

Patchwork is a great hit in my collection, so I doubt I could look this one over!

Though the theme didn't appeal to me at first, the game presents an elegant puzzle

I liked Cottage Garden more than I thought I would. It's a pleasant light game when there's too many players for patchwork. It's well designed, from the cute wheelbarrow holding the single tile pieces to the parasol used as a place holder when considering how a piece could fit on the board. The multi-cube scoring means at a glance, you can't see who's winning without some simple math, so instead of feeling behind the leader on a single track and needing to catch up, players can enjoy the game. And it is enjoyable to finish a garden, score it, and then grab a new board to fill with flowers and cats.

I dig Cottage Garden as a more complex version of Patchwork with more decisions.

I like the tetris mechanism but the rest of the game was kinda boring. Might end up selling this one

(own by ale). From Spiel'16.
A sort of mix between the board game Patchwork and the game app Tong (by Bruno Cathala) with the addition of a special last turn where you can lose points. 
Components are OK (although having the Spiel edition, the stickers for the board really annoy me and a slight bump to the scoring boards usually ends up in a complete mess) and the game is interesting and strategic enough, without been too complicated. Interaction with other players is limited (a part from stealing a tile that they may want) and I personally found the rulebook a little bit obscure in a couple of points.
Nevertheless, the game works well, is easy to teach and fun to play. Unfortunately, at least as a 2-players game, I prefer Patchwork. It's hard to say why, but Patchwork scratches the same itch, but gives a more relaxing sense of accomplishment when it's over.

I have to test Cottage Garden with more than 2 players to see if it works better in this case.

Simple, but engaging, and very little feeling of downtime. Nice!

The tetris aspect is cool, and the kittens are adorable. Otherwise, I wasn't too enamored of the game. Not sure what's missing... maybe it didn't feel tight enough?

Kertészeti Patchwork aka zöldségtetris, immáron 3-4 főre is kibővítve. Jó minőség, szép játék, pörgős menet - egy próbát megér, asszonynak nagy kedvence lehet a téma miatt.

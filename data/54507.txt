This is a pretty dull race game really. Playing on a basic course is just not interesting enough but the addition of animals just add obstacles without adding any more fun.

A simpler, little brother to [b]Snow Tails[/b].  Smaller, easier, and less well-produced.  It's also a little less fun.  Probably good to play with kids, but for the cost to get my own copy, probably not worth it.

Probably a decent family game, but even then you'd have to ramp up the difficulty.  Also, most likely better with more than 2 players to increase the chance of blocking and add a bit strategic play.  Perhaps a game that benefits from some home rules to spice things up.  Also, the map cards could have been a bit heavier and therefore easier to keep in place and manipulate.

Because this came after Snow Tails and is an animal racing game, both made by the Fraggors it will inevitably be compared to Snow Tails. Unfortunately it isn't as good. 

Card stock is two thirds thinner than Snow Tails and it just lacks the sparkle that ST had.

Given the choice of playing the two it will be Snow Tails every time.

Rating based on one 5-player race on basic course.  If I had not already played Snow Tails, I would have been really excited about this game.  This feels like an overly simplified version of Snow Tails that leaves out much of the challenge (and therefore much of the fun).  I would like to try it again soon with more obstacles.

A decently fun and quick filler of a racing game.  If you're looking for a smash hit sequel to Snow Tails, you'll be disappointed, but it's a fairly fun game in it's own right.  Seems like it's at it's best with 5 since board crowding adds to the challenge.

I'm partial to racing games, so you may want to take my comments with a pinch of salt, but I find the game to be fun and exciting. Many talk of a disappointment after the wonderful Snow Tails, and while it is true that Snow Tails is a league above this game, and that Savannah Tails is a simple race game, barely a notch above Ave Caesar, it is still quite fun to race the ostriches around and avoiding obstacles. It's a pity perhaps, that the components are also of inferior quality compared to Snow Tails. So a bit of a mixed bag, all in all.

Savannah Tails is a card-based race game. I do like a good race game but I am coming to the opinion that there isn't much point in owning this one. It is fun, but you get more of the same thrills and spills from Ave Caesar and so Savannah Tails is largely irrelevant. I suppose if you love Ave Caesar and want a change then this is nearly as good. Just not quite as good.

Could have fit in a box half its size.  

Disappointed how small the Ostriches are.  They don't look at all like ostriches to me with their squatly, fat legs.  So I showed one to my daughter, "What animal do you think this is?"  She immediately answers, "An Ostrich".  (It looks like a dinosaur goose-duck to me.)

Savannah Tails could be considered a shortened and simplified version of Snow Tails when it comes to gameplay. At the same time explaining it isn't really easier when playing the advanced version which seems to be the only one worth playing even for casual gamers. That's the problem: There are more interesting race games out there like e.g. Powerboats which are not much more complicated.

It's Ave Caesar (play a card, move, get a card) but with a whole bunch of chrome rules added, including earning special actions and track things you want to move over or avoid.

Until then, too many questions, too slow, not as much screwage and not as enjoyable for what is otherwise a simple mechanic.

At first glance, this appears to be Snow Tails Light, so the comparisons that come may be a bit unfair.

Undoubtedly there are similarities, but Savannah Tails delivers in a much shorter time span and is much more appealing to a broader audience.

I played it at Gulf Games (in final or near-final form). It's a card-driven race game like Snow Tails, but simpler: each player has an identical deck of cards, which are in 4 colors corresponding to the 4 tracks on the board. Cards are numbered 2-6 (I think). Create your own draw deck, and draw a hand of 4 cards. On your turn, play a card then draw a card. Advance your marker along any path according to the number on the card, but must end on the color track matching the card, and cannot shift lanes away from that colored lane during your turn. If you move through an oasis, you may take one of the special power chips, each of which has a different power (increase hand size to 5; allow you to leap over any intervening racers/obstacles; a reusable wild-colored 4 chip). The race ends when anyone crosses the finish line; the player furthest ahead wins.

The game plays pretty quickly and is easier to get into since you don't have to do any of the math or figure out the somewhat complicated drift/turn rules in Snow Tails -- so it ought to be a better race game for non-gamers. But it still should have enough strategy -- with the decisions of how to build the race track and when to go for a special power, how to manage your hand, etc -- to interest gamers.

We'll probably have to pick up a copy!

Rather simple race game. I like it enough to try it and play it once or twice but it's not something I would like to play very often. I'm not a race game fan I must say. This one is really fast paced like it should. Compared to its older brother (snow tails) it's much more simple.

I was lucky enough to have the first pick of the game table at Great Lakes Games '09 and doubly lucky that Fragor sent a copy of Savannah Tails to us from Essen!  I am a huge Snow Tails fan and was very excited to get Savannah Tails.  After two plays I am not disappointed.  It is a lighter racing game, not nearly as unforgiving as Snow Tails can be.  It is a quicker game but still a very fine racing game.  I don't think it is much of a stretch (yea, had to work that in somehow) to say that this is a very fine successor to Snow Tails.  Overall, Snow Tails for me is a better game, but at least part of that is simply that it came first.  It was such a hit with my family, it would be hard for any similar racing game to match our level of enjoyment.  I think Savannah Tails will do well, when we would like to play a ST like game but have less time or are more tired and simply want something that is quicker and easier to play but still fun and engaging.

Though simpler than Snow Tails, I actually prefer this because I don't really care for the drift and dent mechanics of its predecessor.  However, the production is pretty cheap in comparison.  The boards are really ugly and are poorly marked, so it's hard to distinguish them from each other, which made setting up a chore.  Much more accessible and easier to teach.  Therefore, if you're looking to get a quick game going, I'd pick Savannah Tails.

A fairly simple racing game that is a sequel of sorts to Snow Tails. Snow Tails is the better game, but this is faster and sillier, while still providing some decision-making. I could see it getting picked up off the shelf over its bigger brother in certain cases.

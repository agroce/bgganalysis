GAME: Blue Moon City
RANK: 490
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Blue Moon City is one of those games (of which there are many) that makes a good first-impression with it's great production, easy-to-learn rules, quick game play, and oh-so-close ("I was one turn away!") finish. The problem is that these games aren't rewarding. I don't feel any satisfaction for outplaying my opponents, I don't get emotionally involved, I'm not given any interesting problem to solve, there's no excitement or drama, etc...  

As a wise man once said "You don't make friends with salad".

There were a lot of creative ideas in this one, but the execution was meh.   A lot of cards with a lot of special abilities, half of which were just to create wild cards.  The card art was neat, but didn't really have any logical relationship to the game.  Dragons were a weird touch as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Despite the very unusual theme (which almost prevented me from buying this), this is a typical quality Euro game.  Modular board, set collection, with a nice semi-cooperative element (similar to Tower of Babel, another Knizia), and a racing element, all combine to make a light strategy game that scales well from 2-4 players.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to provide a set number of crystals to the tower (the number of crystals depends on the number of players), hence the racing aspect.  On your turn you may move 1-3 spaces (the spaces consist of modular tiles that represent buildings that need to be reconstructed), make a contribution to a building (this is done by playing matching sets of cards), optionally play cards for their special abilities to augment your turn ( cards have two possible functions, there colour/strength and their special ability), and then finally you re-card netting 2 more cards.  There is a semi-cooperative element as it is very difficult to construct a building alone and you gain one time benefits for any building you have contributed to; the most optimal play is to help on buildings but to have helped the most as that player gains slightly more benefits.

Crystals, which are the winning currency of the game, are acquired through reconstruction of buildings, from previously adjacent reconstructed buildings, and indirectly from having dragons observe your reconstruction and them regarding you with dragon scales which get converted into crystals (yes the theme is VERY weird).  This games plays quickly, is easy to learn, is light but has some real decisions to made and plays great 2-4 players.

Have a home made version of the spielbox [boardgame=26189]expansion tiles[/boardgame], which are must have by the way.

RATING: 3
Update: Rating 6 -> 3

While the first few plays were fun, it became very clear how the game rams a tight endgame down your throat as long as you are playing with the basics in mind. After the last few games, the victor was only ahead by one turn. It seems like that should be exciting, but it felt arbitrary.

The way the tiles interrelate seems trivial, and the modular board doesn't really alter strategies, much like in Settlers of Catan (which also got old fast).

===========================

Certainly fun, but I think that'll wear out after about 10 plays or so. Despite the overdeveloped theme, it still feels incredibly dry. Card combos are fun to put together, but I imagine the appeal there is limited.

This certainly has the feel of another "Reiner Math Puzzle". While this sounds like an insult, it isn't. I like Reiner's games (most of them, at any rate). I can appreciate what he's done here, but the only thing I don't understand is why he didn't have any TWO POINT CRYSTAL tokens included -- just one and three crystals. This is quite odd to me.

Still, this isn't a bad game... I enjoy it.

A fun game.  Gameplay is pretty easy to grasp.  Not very deep, in my opinion.  Very light on strategy, though I enjoy it a great deal.  As long as you're not expecting a very deep or strategic game, you may be pleasantly surprised.

Downgraded from 8 to 7 (5/01/08).  Not my favorite of games, though a very good one.  I'll play it occasionally, but I'm unlikely to suggest it.  There's just not much strategy at work and the end is too often *very* close between a few players.  YMMV.

A good (very) light middleweight, which I enjoy every time it comes out.  The alternate starting patterns available on BGG can jazz it up nicely.

Update: raised the score from 7.5 to 8 after a revisit a year or so on.  When everyone at the table knows the game well and you're playing random starting cities, this is a very good game.

Update: And back down to 7.5 after another run.  The BGG scale is a subjective measure, and as I play more games, I simply have more convenient options for a light middleweight.

Blue Moon City is one of Knizia's more elegant designs. No funky math here. Very intuitive. And some awesome artwork with a whimsical sci-fi theme. 

Nevertheless, it is a bit bare bones in what you can do. I have no doubt that experts can really burn their brains at the decision making. But the elements involved within your decisions are not incredibly compelling to me. I find it merely a good hand management game with an interesting modular board that players compete over for area influence and other bonuses.

At core this is a hand management game, in which you try to make the most efficient use of your cards (the special powers of many of the cards make this less straightforward than first appears), while discarding those that aren't essential.  Competition for the dragon scales and the time pressure of building the obelisk add interest.  Blue Moon City is not a deep game, but the mechanics are well integrated, the theming is nicely resonant of the card game, the artwork is fine, and it's fun to play occasionally.

I playtested this game.

My rating after numerous plays.  This one was not on my radar at all as Blue Moon had fallen somewhat flat for me and I know that I probably wouldn't get my wife interested in it either.  Blue Moon City was a complete turn-around.  An Interesting hand management game with some movement mechanics and area majority.  The first play had me immediately asking for another play.  Quite a good two player and the wife is quite taken with it as well.

This game is just for experienced players.

The game is played without interaction between players that make who draw the best cards will be the guaranteed winner.

The colors of the game are very confusing for color-blind people but can be neglect for hard-core experienced player.

Examples of my words during play.
"My turn! What color is it and this and this?"
"OK! I will play these cards. Huh! wrong color of cards? Sorry, please wait for my new decision"
"My turn again! What color is it? I forgot"
"I will move Red Dragon 3 step with my red card. Cannot?, Why?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
{2 plays, 4 player} My initial reaction was "wow," as I really liked everything going on in this game.  After my second play, however, I find myself slightly worried that you *must* follow the pack to have any chance, which is too bad if it's true, as I like the wide open board and how it initially allows you to maximize your hand, but later closes up and forces you to maybe spend a lot of cards.  Also, both games have felt just a bit too short, which I suppose is the better side to err on.  It's odd how some gameplay will "fit" its length, and this one has twice ended too soon for me, mostly, I think, because of the dragon scales adding more "money" - though I really like how the payoffs escalate as each adjacent region closes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Got fed up with not having a short, light 3 player game, so I finally went out and bought one.  Feels very overpriced for the components (especially if you bought it from the FLGS and didn't get 30% off).  Could easily have been a small box game, rather than overproduced big square box.  I just repacked it into a small Illuminati box with no problem, and I'm going to have to print a condensed version of the rules for easier carrying.

Nice theming.  The components are all very nicely produced, from the leaf-shaped dragon scales, to the plastic dragons, to the large tiles.  All of them are thick and sturdy.  The card deck is nicely coated as well.  Top notch components... but again, I would have settled for thinner, less pretty, and less expensive.

Gameplay is great.  Nice movement mechanics, combined with a reasonably deep resource management component.  It's a game where there's always something useful to do.

i thought i was going to be unimpressed as i was learning the rules.  it started off in a slump, but i grew to like it, then it kinda slumped again with the short scoring.  i don't like it when games have winning conditions as low as 4 points just because of the tying/turn order possibilities, and this game looks vulnerable.  i'm not really into the fact that everyone gets to the same level at roughly the same time, seemingly regardless of what they do.  i need more plays to qualify that kind of statement.  anyway, as i've gotten further away and read the rules myself and such, i've become more interested in it.  i still like the tower of babel kind of set up your later scoring thing.  plays with 2p and 3p yielded more of the same, but now there's the supposedly original crystals variant to try sometime.

RATING: 7
An influence game that gives the feeling of a racing to an end.  It is mostly a card-driven game with a variable board layout (semi-random) to distribute influence locations.  Game play is clean and quick and offers choices, but does not facilitate long term planning over  several turns .  The use of the races from Blue Moon and giving each race an influence /ability reflective of how the decks are constructed is a nice tie-in, but overall the tie-ins are quite weak.  Art work is nicely done especially if you are a fan of the Blue Moon decks.  The game definitely feels like a Knizia design, but with more meat than some of his most recent card games.  One of his better designs in recent years. [GTI: TPCL]

You have to make the best of the cards you have each turn - more tactics than strategy.  If everyone heads off in the opposite direction at the beginning of the game it is difficult to catch up as you need to be party to the resolution of adjacent tiles.  Disappointing despite the gorgeous production.  To my disappointment a second play confirmed my negative feelings toward the game.  With more plays maybe I would 'get it', but there are many more games I would rather play.

Blue Moon City is good enough.  It's a nice game that accommodates four players with fairly deep strategic possibilities.  There's nothing here that is unfamiliar or terribly mind blowing but the whole package just seems to work.

It plays well with 2,  it's not quite hand management, not quite tile laying, not quite worker placement, but it feels a bit like all of these.

Players are trying to rebuild Blue Moon City. Each player uses the people of Blue Moon, and with the aid of the dragons, to rebuild the city, doing this earns them diamonds that are used to make contributions to the oblisk.

Our games are always close in this, and the mechanism for collecting the crystals is pretty clever,  I generally do a lot of card collecting/seeding the board for the first half of the game, just being opportunistic, and the second half concentrating on the crystals collected.  Dragon scales are very much secondary to me, though this depends on the other players whether or not it gets any consideration.

It's a typical Knizia game, with clever use of cards, hand management and scoring system: collect card, convert them in crystals and then convert crystals in points. Everything is very straightforward, but is nevertheless challenging and engaging.
Very good game, scaling well to two!

One playing.  Very enjoyable game of area majority, forward planning and even a bit of resource/hand management.  I found that the players followed each other around earning bonuses where they were to be had and ensuring that each got a little something for each building when they could.  Remembering to build to the obelisk and being set up to earn bonuses from completed buildings seemed key.  Yes I realize that you can only win by building to the obelisk, but one guy didn't until it reached the level of nine and the other two players had three each.  It was too much of a hill for him to climb.   Recommended.   PS.  Nothing like the card game except for theme.

Fun and light. There may be an issue with turn order determining the winner and no way to modify turn order. This means that in some situations the game ends with other players having one less turn and being able to complete the last crystal for the obelisk.

Don't use this as a gateway game. I don't know why I tried, it seemed like it would work. It didn't. Other than that, this one seems unusually unforgiving of even slight differences in player skill. Less "you took what I wanted" than I would expect, given the whole game seems set up for it. Pile on the leader issue.

Another game I purchased with Christmas 2008 money gifts in the search for games I can play with my family.  I think I found a winner.  Everyone I've taught enjoys it, they pick it up quick, and there's enough strategy for even the most hard core gamer.  Doesn't take forever.  Deciding how many cards to commit to obtain crystals is always a dilemma.  [Gift]

This game surprised me.  I wasn't expecting to like it, but it turned out to be quite good.  After one play, it's a solid 8, but could potentially get higher as it plays pretty quickly, even with four, and there's lots of stuff to be done, with multiple ways of winning.  Although it has very little in common with San Juan, the speed of the game and its multiple strategies remind me of it for some reason.  That is a point in its favor, as San Juan is one of my favorite games.  To sum up: a game that I initially had zero interest is now considered as a potential buy after one play.  That alone should be indicative of how solid this game is.

RATING: 8
Most games have rules that place restrictions on your options, but this one seems to have pushed that approach straight off the highest tower it could find, and introduced an almost free-form modular smorgasbord of mechanisms, special action cards, and other turn enablers, and somehow keeping it straightforward. It plays like a breeze.

Several cards have an alternative use attached, and if you put your mind to it and have managed your hand well, the options available to you in a single turn offer a wide range of possible actions. Off course, if you are not satisfied with the usual 2 card redraw at the end of your turn, you can replace the dud cards in your hand too. Anything to be more effective in the next one. 

Now, on the heels of a wide range of possible actions, there usually lurks a substantial increase in thinking time per player, especially for a certain type of players. Instead, players seem quite capable to quickly settle on creative, and highly effective card usage without thinking all joy out of the experience for others. All the more impressive if you realize that certain cards allow players to turn up anywhere on the board. Some people appear to forget that they normally think through [i]all[/i] possible moves before committing.

Amazingly, it all falls into place quite pleasant. And astonishingly, it doesn't come unstuck at all, even when people get [i]very[/i] creative at combining card values with special powers and dragon calling. Someone did his homework - no Doktor needed to apply game-saving patches. It is well-balanced, and with a game like this, it suggests that some capable folk have put in some sound play-testing.

I initially loved this game, because it is stylish and visually stunning, and also because you can use your cards in a variety of ways and therefore are never "stuck."  It's also cooperative -- the only competition is to reach the goals first, but you work together on mini-goals (rebuilding certain buildings).  There are no negative events that happen in the game, either played on each other or within the mechanics of the game, so it's really just a race.  Eventually that aspect is what makes the game less challenging.  Over time, you increase your efficiency, but there may not be a huge amount of strategy beyond that.  However, I happen to love game artwork and fun pieces (dragon scales, crystals, dragons, cubes, cards with neat artwork) so for me that alone makes Blue Moon City worth the price of admission.

The strategic choices here just don't interest me in the least.  Manage cards, play cards, drop cubes on board, fall asleep.  Theme does not mesh with the gameplay well at all.  Just not my proverbial cup of tea.  Sent it packing after several tries with varying players.

A good little game. I like the art work, and there were definitely some good decisions to make. A lot of luck with the cards, but working with what you have is a big part of the game. 

With two people, it was a tight race. I'd like to see what it's like with three people and see how the strategy differs.

RATING: 8
Rating based on two 2-player games.  I have not played the card game.1) It's beautiful.  Very nice art that combines the old art from the card game with new stuff.  Components feel solid though I don't know about the cards.2) Not too complicated but there are a few little details you have to remember.  I didn't think it felt like a typical Knizia game.3) There's a lot of information you need to process.  I think a big part of the game is looking at the board, looking at your hand, and trying to make sense of it all.  I kind of like that, so that makes me like the game.4) However, after only two games, I felt a little railroaded.  I think given the information you have, there is one obvious choice of plays.  So maybe the winner is the player who is best able to process the information?Update: After a few 3 and 4 player games I don't feel as though the choices are as clear.  When you go to the Obelisk plays a big part in your strategy.  Plus, the special powers of the cards give you a lot of different ways to play your hand.

This game was a big hit with a group of three mostly non-boardgamer friends and relatives after they figured out what was going on. The biggest hurdle was figuring out what the cards did; I won the first game and the second game was very close in scoring but my brother won that one. It's guaranteed to hit the table again when we get togther. One friend said it felt similar to Condottiere, which we had played for the first time last week. It's not that deep but very interesting tactically and has nice balance.

So, Ive finally decided that games that rely heavily on coat-tail riding and player inducement are not my forte, nor my favorite. This game has some of that, and as such gets knocked down a bit for me. I do love the action cards, and the similar feel to action point games that they seem to provide.

The last interesting thing Knizia has done--not his best game by any stretch of the imagination, but like many Knizia works it scales well, and the trick of having "weaker" cards having more powerful special effects is a clever one. Also, unlike many euros, you really have to pay attention to what everyone else is doing; the best Knizia games thrive on player interaction and this is not an exception.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't know what happened to Knizia, but before he went on hiatus he had a run of very good games replete with all the qualities we love in Knizia's games.  I am referring to Palazzo, Tower of Babel, Beowulf, and Blue Moon City.  Each game lies firmly in the middleweight category, attempts to keep all players engaged simultaneously and encourages some very direct player interaction; in short, the very best Euro game design has to offer.  The last of these and perhaps the weakest is Blue Moon City.  

I find Blue Moon City redolent of Tower of Babel in that players must strike a delicate balance between cooperation and competition.  The difference here is that that the cooperative element is a little more obliquely implemented and altogether too friendly.  Offerings in Tower of Babel always came with very mercenary and calculated intentions and the intricate and well-crafted scoring system keenly enhanced all the variables.  In Blue Moon City the benefits of cooperation requires that everyone work together and an atmosphere of peace, harmony and love usually reigns.  Admittedly, later in the game the assumed leader (usually,however, the game is too tight to finger anyone) has problems with acquiring building partners, but by that point it usually doesn't matter.

What I am trying to get at is that none of my decisions really seem to matter.  At the end of the game everyone has done almost equally well.  I can't remember a game without someone able to win on the same turn as the actual winner.  Tight games don't constitute a bad feature, but it just reinforces how I actually feel during the game.  I kind of coast along, following my cards and the other players, rarely making any truly important decisions and while I have a nice time, I play games for intellectual stimulation and Blue Moon City rarely does any of that.

RATING: 6
Okay efficiency game.  Feels abstract to me.  The game engine rewards players who find themselves in the right place at the right time... and rewards players that seed the board with their own cubes.  Although it's tempting to run off and work alone on the opposite side of the board, you really need to play "follow the leader" to get the most crystals and dragon scales (and to be a contendor for victory).  When one tile is completed, players who worked on the tile get goodies (and the biggest contributor gets the most goodies)... but then the tile is turned over and it adds a bonus (reward) to any adjacent tiles that get completed.  If you can't get the right cards to stay near your opponents on the profitable side of the board, you might find yourself at the back of the pack in a hurry.  It takes a long time to complete tiles on your own, so think twice before breaking ground on tiles that are far from your opponents.  Undoubtedly, efficiency is very important (both in card play and board play).  I like the race element created by the early "bricks" of the obelisk costing a lot less than later bricks... but I dislike the "follow the leader" element caused by the game's economic engine.

RATING: 7
In our first 2-player "learning" game there was a clear lead for one player at the beginning, but the endgame was very close - whoever made it back to the obelisk first was the winner. The simple decision of one player NOT discarding some cards to draw more than two at the end of the anti-penultimate turn ended up being the game loser! My hope is that play with 3-4 will feel like less of a race for the finish line and more as though mid-game decisions matter.

Second play over a year later with 4 people, and nearly the same situation: very close endgame with a sudden race by what we thought was only two people, and then a single completed city changed the situation so that the others had more crystals, the obelisk filled up in less than a round, and a third person took the game with a surprising win from behind. Overall enjoyable, but not particularly challenging.

Players move about a razed city in Knizia's Blue Moon universe in order to reconstruct it. Buildings are reconstructed by making a series of "contributions" by playing cards in different suits (corresponding to the races found in said universe) and receiving rewards on the successful reconstruction of each building. The rewards can either be "crystals," "scales" (pieces which make up a separate sub-game which garners yet more crystals), cards or a combination of the three.

The cards work together in specific colours (suits) and also can have an "event card" effect which will be familiar to players of GMT's card-driven games. Amassing crystals allows the player to make further "contributions" to a central monolith which effectively acts like a VP track. First player to make a given number of escalating crystal contributions wins.

Play is simple and fast moving yet satisfying. While only for four players (so far), it makes a great filler for those nights when you still have a little time left but prefer slightly meatier fare than most fillers provide.

Very fun and quick game.  It uses some neat mechanics for players to gain a style of currency (crystals) which are further used to purchase other monuments (cubes).  There also some mechanics which allow players able to gain income to get multipliers (scales) which can at certain times be traded for currency.  You have to time things well as the cost of monuments raise quickly and there is a set amount of currency available

Played once.  Enjoyed it - it has a nice tension as you race to get to 4 offerings first.  But I think there isn't too much strategy here.  The winner of the game wasn't really sure how or why she had won - not a good sign.

This game has it all. Area control, resource management and auctions. There is some tactics also in the game, but that is very much down to do the best with what cards you draw.
So there is a slight luck bias in the game, but in the bitter end it doesn't disturb the game at all.
Easy to teach and play. The replayability is high.

Typical Knizia, which means its a good game with a pasted on theme that ends up playing like an abstract. That said however, Blue Moon City is a pretty fun game and one that is simple enough that you could pick it up and play with new people and have little trouble.

Very interesting game.  It is very straightforward and easy to understand despite having a lot of options and a lot of information to keep track of.  Many decisions to be made and I'm not sure yet the best strategy for victory.  Random card draws can have a big impact on the outcome.

Blue Moon City, le jeu de société, commence la ou le jeu a deux joueurs s'arrete : la reconstruction de la ville détruite de Blue Moon. Le plateau de jeu, illustré par Frank Vohwinkel et d'autres dessinateurs américains de Fantasy bien connus, consiste en 21 grandes tuiles batiments, qui exposent les plans du batiment d'un coté et le batiment reconstruit de l'autre. Comme dans le jeu pour 2, celui-ci inclut 3 dragons moulés en plastique.

Nothing special honestly. I guess I was expecting the moon, and to be sure, it is a fun light game, but Knizia's games just feel dated and disconnected to me. I might try and play this some more, as I quite like its structure, it just doesn't pop for me. More data required.

Interesting, interactive game of set-collection and resource optimization.

Destined to become an all time classic!  This game compares quite well with the great German games we have come to know and love (Settlers, Puerto Rico, Ra, Ticket to Ride) and brings the kind of magic to the table that made us fall in love with such games to begin with.  The game is fast playing, presents lots of choices, the competition keeps the pressure on to seize opportunities, and it has a very satisfying ending and then you say "Let's play it again!" just like you used to with the old favorites.

The game is easy enough to learn in 10 minutes, but requires so many decisions that it never seems simplistic. It plays in less than an hour, has a very cool theme, and has great artwork and components.

The luck factor is balanced nicely by the special effects of the cards. This means you have to make a lot of hard choices: do you use that grey card to move now, or use it in combination with a white card to build next turn? The addition of the dragon scales also forces you to decide whether to save cards or use them immediately for a shot at extra points. Even the fact that you have only ten cubes really changes the way you play, preventing you from spreading yourself too thin. I look forward to using the alternative tile layouts posted on BGG to make it more challenging.

Probably would have won SDJ if it didn't have the fantasy theme.  There's not enough interaction for my taste, but it's a non-offensive game that works.

This is a really clever game. When explaining the rules, it's actually pretty easy to make Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage jokes, because players are playing cards either for the values, 1-3, or for events, and it does actually have a touch of the flavor of Hannibal. Like most of Knizia's recent games, Blue Moon City eludes easy classification, having elements of auction, area-control, resource management, and pure tactics. Perhaps the most striking thing is that the area-control part has scoring which often does not particularly favor the player who comes in first; in the mid-late game, it's not unusal for everyone involved to get big payoffs, but for the "winner" to get just a token bonus.

Knizia may not be doing as many true "gamer's games" as he has in the past, with stuff like Amun-Re and Taj Mahal becoming comparatively rare. But still, I think Blue Moon, Blue Moon City, and Beowulf represent some of the best work he's ever done, simple and playable yet with depth, shorter but challenging, well-balanced and perfectly-executed, beautifully produced, with a blend of strategic and tactical skills, and with excellent theme and fun factors. They are perfect blends, providing something for everyone, and to me absolutely represent what good social games should be.

As an aside, I'd agree with Joe Gola that the 3-player version of the game seems slightly tighther. But I've been happy with both 3 and 4.

Not one of my favorites. BMC left us feeling cold - like we had all just played solitaire but happened to be using the same set of components to do so. There is no player interaction in this game at all. For example, I tried once to move a couple of the dragons faaar away from my opponents - who simply flew them back to where they wanted on their own turn. I don't see any way to "compete" with your opponents: each player is simply racing to stay ahead of the others with the cards in your hand solely dictating each of your actions rather than a mix of cards in hand and the situation on the tiles in play.

And the beautiful artwork on the tiles are in stark contrast to much of the low-grade kiddie art found on the cards.

The plastic box insert had nothing to do with the components included in this particular game.

Traded for cash.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The more I play, the less I like.  It seems like the game is so balanced that everyone is always ready to cash in their last stash at the same time, which means that someone ends up throwing someone the game at the end by scoring something, allowing the next player in line that scored on that tile to win.  Most of the game is pretty fun, but the endgame cools me off on this one a little bit.

A good racing and hand management game disguised as a building game. I can see this possibly being a great game but I suspect it needs more than 2 players to make it so. My first game was with 3 players but otherwise I've only played it with 2 so for now I'm giving it a 7.

UPDATE: Having played several more times, I still like Blue Moon City but it suffers in the end game. Like a lot of Euros, it keeps the game close until the very end to ensure all players remain engaged. But, because games are always close, it's usually a slight edge in luck that determines who the winner is rather than good game play, especially with experienced players.

Knizia is usually great at making very simple games with more depth than the rules suggest. I think he fails here though.

Good light strategy, easy for no gamers to get into. My Girlfriend, who is a total non gamer, bought me this, and still plays it with me. My only complaint is that while the art is great, the theme (The "Blue Moon" universe) is a bit lame. That's a personal choice though. Maybe if instead of rebulding a fantasy city for dragons you securing hoods and pushing hoes and crack for you pimp I could relate to this more. OK, well at least maybe a mafia theme would fit better.

A pretty good light/medium game! There is a lots of cards which do various things, but there isn't really a huge issue of "the luck of the draw" as it seems you can always use some of the cards for something! It's extremely balanced in that sense, but what else did you expect when it's a game from the great Knizia. The mechanics are very well thought out and I really like the dilemmas you are put in when playing this game; which tile to restore, where to go, which cards to use, move dragons, when to go spend crystals etc.! A pretty good game which I like and will gladly play from time to time.

A tight game for four players.  The theme is hardly important, although the art is quite good.  Games usually come down to close wins, and I've rarely seen someone be heavily screwed by card draws.

The only thing that doesn't give this game a perfect 10 is the game is too driven by cards.  Other than that, even though the board is modular, the board doesn't seem very different from a game to another... not that's it's a bad thing, but if you go and make a modular board, make the impact of the tiles a bit bigger I think.

Anyway, a very solid family or light strategy game that I recommand to everyone.

A light game that is very engaging (game to player).  Direct player interaction on the board is limited, however table talk and persuasion can be abdunant.  This is important with only two because the players can go their separate ways and never contribute to the same buildings.  The  four player game is better.  It forces other players to contribute to the same buildings.
Card and tile art is nice.  I like the colors used for the pawns and cubes.
Eventhough this seems to be a gateway game the card combos and special powers confused the nongamers I played with.  TtR can be the setup man, perhaps BMC is the closer.

At one time I had 6 or 8 Blue Moon decks. I love the unique and beautiful artwork, but the gameplay never felt really satisfying to me. Now Blue Moon City brings back the fabulous art with a fun game with interesting decisions. This game leaves me feeling like there are depths of strategy to discover. I like the hand management.

I wonder if there is a turn order imbalance. I'm not sure there is, but with how close the game can be and the winning conditions, it seems like going first may be an uncompensated advantage. 

This is a game I look forward to playing. I may need to pick up a copy of this one.

Blue Moon City is a move, invest, and then reinvest kind of game where your options from turn to turn are dictated by an 8 suited, 3 ranked deck with art from the Blue Moon Universe. The board is a series of tiles, and each requires certain card types to be tithed so that one can reap some benefits when said building is completed. If dragons are hanging around when you add to a building, then you get some bonus tiles from them, which later transform into crystals, which are the main currency of the game. When each individual tile is finished (which requires between 1 and 4 seperate tithes) then the player who contributed the most is given a special bonus, and everyone who helped at all also gets something. More bonuses are given out when other buildings in the neighbourhood are already complete. As I said earlier, the main economy of the game is crystals, and those are used to complete an obelisk. When a player contributes a target number of tithes to build the obelisk, then the game is over and they win.

If you couldn't tell by the short summary above, this is another one of those Knizia games that has a number of wheels within wheels. Really though, by Dr. K standards, this game isn't that hard to just sit down to an enjoy. Player options on a given turn are kept manageable by one's hand and the amount of space that one can move, yet there is still some leeway for creative play and hand tailoring due to the ability to discard and redraw at the end of each of your turns.

My first impressions of the game were reasonably solid. Lighter medium weight, some randomness inherent because of the cards, but some decent decisions and a pretty fast playtime. I question the amount of player differentiation that can occur though. The obvious strategy thus far seems to be sticking with the pack, because then more tiles are being flipped easily, so you get more bonuses, and more dragons are hanging out and waiting for the par-tay. In this sense, the game seems largely about having that slightly better hand than the other people in the same part of the board, because ultimately where you SHOULD be going seems to be driven by what the other folks are doing. In that sense, I wonder, in retrospect, how much meaningful control I actually have over the game while I'm playing it. It's OK, but after playing it a couple of times I feel that I've seen about all that I need to here.

After about five plays (11/2007) this game is starting to grow on me.  Each game is close, but I'm not sure if that is due to the well-tuned design or the choices I make as a player.  A little bit of luck due to cards, and every little decision either counts or is irrelevant--I'm not sure.  I've got to play this more and analyze my choices to find out if this game gives players meaningful choices or not.

This is another one of those games that the more I play the more I like it. I have only played it 4 times and needs to see how it goes with 2 or 3 players. The way the different tiles play "score" is interesting and reminds a little of Louis XIV.

I also love the art.

RATING: N/A
 Blue Moon City is one of the easiest games to pick up, play, and teach. It has a unique and captivating art style that creates the world of Blue Moon. It is constantly gratifying as you rebuild the city - turn over tiles as it is restored to its former glory. The tiles are randomly placed, giving it a new game board every play through. The mechanics constantly reward the players by giving them new cards to make contributions, crystals to make purchases, dragon scales in a race to collect the most. On the surface it's as simple as mixing and matching cards to make combinations, but once you start to take in the special abilities and placement tactics, the game evolves into a highly analytical and thoughtful game. Where do I contribute to get the greatest reward? How can I get other players to do the hard work for me?

A game that brings gamers and non gamers alike. My fiance, and parents love it. A great gateway game into more complex games. A gem that isn't to be missed.

based on one 2 player game, one 3 player game and one 4 player game.  It gets better with each play.  I like that there is no obvious path to victory.  You really need to diversify to win.  It scales VERY well.  There is just enough luck to keep those who like luck and those who dislike luck all happy.  (I am of the dislike luck camp)  The theme is strong.  The components are of a very high quality.  I think this game will hit the table often.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Un fantástico juego recomendable para casi todo el mundo. 

Casi no lo he jugado y no se la razón. Suele gustar a todo el mundo.

Tiene una gran mecánica similar a la card-driven. Resalto su sencillísima puntuación en la  que es tan fácil como conseguir sumar tan solo !4, 5 o 6 "puntos"! nada que ver con todas las puntuaciones que se hacen a lo largo de un juego de mayorías o de otros juegos.

Segun este post de la BGG http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/152350 Knizia comentó en primera persona, que la regla original suya, y la que prefiere, es que cuando se hace el conteo de mayorías de las escamas, todo el mundo pierde todas aunque tenga una o dos, Kosmos por sus motivos suavizo esta regla. Muy interesante y creo varia bastante la forma de jugar; tenemos otro juego nuevo. A parte de esto, el juego tiene muchas mas cosas a favor, cada uno le da sus valores a cada carta y a cada objeto en cada momento, no es como el RA que sabes exactamente que valor tiene cada cosa con un cálculo matemático.[/COLOR]

Smooth, fun, simple, fast. My wife has consistently beat me at this now, the game always hinges on several critical moves. I love it, and am glad that I got it in a great trade.  On a funny note, the game that I got in a trade was owned by a family that apparently liked the game, but felt that the cards were a too bit scandalous, and therefore scribbled marker over all women-cleavage.  The funny thing is, I don't notice it when we're playing.

This game has an annoying hidden trackable information (HTI) rule. See the 6th general preference about games in my profile for why I strongly dislike all HTI. I intend to always play this game with open crystal tokens unless forced not to at gunpoint.
My rating for the game includes a +0.5 bonus for theme, because it plays in the world of [family=3226]Blue Moon[/family] and develops it further. But this bonus is canceled by a -0.5 penalty for the stupid HTI rule.

Components: Stunning artwork on the building tiles and the cards. The iconography is perfectly functional.

Experience: Tense race game. Before playing, I had thought there would be some element of cooperation, with players working together to rebuild the structures; in fact it is a mad dash for crystals by any means available. There isn't enough time to get everything done, to be part of every scoring, to efficiently make offerings, etc., so each move is crucial. There are many opportunities for strategic uses of my cards, which I find to be the core of the game. The cards can be used in so many different combinations it can make my head swirl. Still, I wish there were more strategy in the game; the rapid turnover of cards in my hand, and the quickly changing game board, make it difficult to plan too far ahead.

A good combination of options and leveraging off other players' actions. However, my second game ended with two late-game rounds of card draws that were completely useless. Maybe a less random card-draw (ala Thurn & Taxis or Ticket to Ride) might make the game more tactical and tight.

Another relatively easy-to-learn Reiner game, but one that nevertheless provides lots of replayability and scales really well whether you're playing with 2 (a good couples game), 3, or 4. Recommended.

September 2014 update: Downgraded to 6 just because I don't feel particularly excited to play the game anymore. A good Reiner game, but not a great Reiner game. Really, the whole Blue Moon mythos leaves me a bit dry. Basically, I don't think anything changed about this game; I just think the world of gaming has gotten increasingly more interesting in the intervening (since 2007) years....

Picked this up. Recieved favorably at game night. Ideal for 3 players. Light, but does have some interesting choices. Some kingmaking if opponents are not careful. Play anytime, but not as rich an experiecnce as say, Caylus. Wish there was a boxed way to collect the expansions which appear to be only via some german magazine. Play advice: the scales are much more important than you may think at first. And the yellow 1 and 2 cards that allow double contributions at the obelisk.

Unique, fun and beautiful Knizia sequel to the card game, that even though very different somehow incorporated the theme and racial powers of the original. I love how movement around the board is sort of a dance, since you need to react and try to take advantage of other player's moves and so don't want to go off on your own. Nothing else looks or plays like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impression: Good game. Scales well from 2 to 4 players. 

One's fate seems heavily dependent on the cards that are drawn, though. If you can't get in on any of the buildings that are being completed during the end game, you're in trouble. Too soon for me to tell yet how much proper hand management might play a role to offset that.

Regardless, it's an engaging experience. I hope it will see the table more often.

Move pawn around tiles representing the city, use cards for special benefits (moving dragons, extra move, etc) and spending cards of a given color in order to place a cube on the tile. When cube spots on tile are filled, players with cubes on the tile earn rewards and tile flips. Players periodically move to the center of play area to spend crystals to build the obelisk, which is how the game is won. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Just finished playing 2 2-player games of this and it became a seesaw battle at best. If you are unable to match or beat your opponent to the first few obelisk points at the beginning of the game, there is no way back into the game, unless your opponent gets a disgustingly bad draw of cards. Just plays out like that old game of one hand over your opponents' hand and whoever's hand is at the top of the bat gets first ups...I'm hoping the mechanics change significantly in a 3 to 4 player game.

(2-4 jugadors, i funciona especialment bé a 2 jugadors).
Euro 'majories' dissenyat per en Knizia. 
El disseny del joc és molt bonic, amb unes il·lustracions fantàstiques i un tema/història interessant però 'pegat'. El dibuix de les cartes ni el mires, però les llosetes sí les veus i aporten cert relaxament mental.
Les cartes serveixen per 2 coses: o la uses per posar cubitos (majories) o la uses per la seva acció especial. Les que tenen accions especials molt bones, contribueixen poc a les majories, i viceversa. Així que compensa.
És una mena de continuació (almenys pel que fa a la temàtica) d'un joc de miniatures anomenat Blue Moon, en el que varies races (extraterrestres) lluitaven per dominar la ciutat de Blue Moon, però en la lluita la devastaven. En Blue Moon City, s'arriba a una situació de pau, i les diverses races col·laboren per reconstruir la ciutat (ojo!! no és un joc col·laboratiu, i no controlem una raça!, és competitiu, i cada jugador fa ús de totes les races i poders que tenen, en forma de cartes).

Seems like the ending comes suddenly - the payouts for completing buildings get bigger as the "neighbor bonuses" kick in.

Under the thin theme there's a great game. I do prefer the Blue Moon theme to yet another Egyptian one but wish they could have come up with something more interesting. As for the game, I wouldn't really call it a family game as advertised as there's quite a lot of planning and counting involved.

Update: The game gets better with more plays. More analytical too which isn't everyone's cup if tea I guess.

RATING: 6
Just one play.  The game seems very well balanced, with the non-winning players a few crystals shy from winning at the end.  In fact, it could be too tight.  By that, I wonder if the player who goes first has a better chance of winning than the other players?  That was the case in our game as that extra move for the 1st player proved to be the difference.  I doubt that's the case, but I look forward to my next game to make that determination.  If player #1 wins again with all the other players needing 1 more move to win, I'll drop it down to a 6 or 5.

Player 1 did win again so bumping down to 6 (from 7).  It's a good game all in all, but I'm finding it to be too bland for my taste.  There just isn't enough action or tough decisions.

I learned this at one of the Wednesday Coolstuff Games board game nights from a regular. The game itself seemed fine, but I was stopped dead in my tracks by the similarities of the colors. I had difficulty telling many of them apart, and it really handicapped my ability to play the game and made me irritable on top of that. Because of that, I do not have any great desire to play the game, yet the game itself seemed fine.

The Blue Moon wars are over, now all the peoples have a group hug and rebuild the city.  Players move their pawns over the city site, playing cards (8 different "suits", one for each of the Blue Moon peoples) to place construction blocks onto face down building tiles.  Once all the slots on a tile are full, the building is complete and anyone participating earns rewards.  Rewards include cards, dragon scales, and the important crystals.  There is a special reward for the best builder, plus nice bonuses from already complete adjacent buildings.  The crystals are used to make offerings to the monument in the centre of the city, and first to make a set number of offerings wins.  The kicker here is each race on the cards has a special ability, loosely themed on the two player card game.  The Flit make you move faster, Khind are weak but useful everywhere, Mimix are better paired up, etc.  Lots to think about - economy of movement, completing buildings to maximise adjacency rewards, how to use the cards to best effect (buildings or abilities).
Recent plays in 2011 have solidified my option - this is a quality design - possibly one of Knizia's best.  Excellent.

For the love of God, why did Kosmos make this a lame fantasy theme? This is honestly one of the best eurogames to bless our hobby in awhile, but rarely has a theme and look of a game been so disconnected from it's mechanisms. The game itself is a fast, clever building game with a lot of neat interactions and tough choices. The adjacency bonuses make for a lot of decisions, and the race for scales is also very interesting. I'll admit that I'm a sucker for hand management, but everyone should give this modern classic a chance.

Great Eurogame.  Wasn't sure about it at first, but I liked it more each time I played it.  I eventually had to have it.  I like the player interaction.

Besides the theme, it has very little to due with the card game Blue Moon in game play, but after trying this game I bought a used copy of Blue Moon, and I am a big Blue Moon theme fan now.  Two great games by the same designer with very different gameplay.

I like how fast you burn through the cards in this game.  There's a good amount of decision making with the dual-use cards, which is why I'd rather play this than Ticket To Ride.  The hand management here is a lot more fun.  I suppose this is Reiner's best game in a while.  There has been some concern about turn order advantages, and I can see that, but it's easily tweaked.

More Knizia goodness. While not as focused as some of his other designs, there's still the usual Knizia mix: plenty of strategy built around a little bit of luck.

Clever usage of the obelisk decides games: sure, it takes actions and particular cards to get the game-deciding points of the obelisk, but if you neglect this you'll find yourself doing great but essentially unable to win.

A board game some-what similar to Blue Moon the card card game.

Blue Moon City lays in ruins and the original races try to rebuild the city. The one that does the best job wins. A market game which requires you to build temples, learning centers, government, etc.

Quick game once everyone understands it.  Always seems a bit overwhelming to hear what the cards do, and a bit simplistic with what you can do each turn, but once you're into it, it has a nice light depth to it.

RATING: 8
Card combinations give you interesting board movement trade offs. The dragon scale race generates medium-term tension, while collecting gems and racing on the tower, with the option of using yellow cards to place two tower cubes in one turn, generates endgame tension. Feels entirely like a Knizia.

RATING: 7
The variable board and the area control mechanic are fantastic. Very approachable family game (more so then the card game). Took me 4-5 games to really understand good and bad moves. I still have a lot to learn. I prefer this game with two or three. As the rules are written 2-player ends a bit early. Rating is rising... Rating went down.

Reiner Knizia game. What an original game! Great atmosphere and flavor. Many many choices and various stategies on what to do. The game feels like a card game, plus a strategy board game, plus a "themed" game all in one. Games are often very close. Excellent, excellent game. Very tense.

Played Blue Moon City once.

I was told the Blue Moon card game was similar to Magic the Gathering. I played Magic the Gathering for a couple of years and enjoyed it. Since m not too into card games, I wondered what the board game edition would be like. I was glad I got the chance of playing Blue Moon City.

The game was a nice surprised. I enjoyed the game.  Looking forward to another game of Blue Moon City.

Bought the game after I played it. My copy never got played, so I traded it. If get the chance to played Blue Moon City again and enjoy it, I just might buy it a second time.

TRADED.

I'm no Knizia fanboy, but I really enjoy Blue Moon City. It's gorgeous, quick to play, and nicely strategic (even if I am cursing the cards in my hand half the time). Plays quite differently with two players, and I think I prefer the greater interaction of a four-player game (even if they tend to be over before you know it!). Dare I say that this is my favorite Knizia game?

Do you feel lucky punk?  I hope so if you want to pick up this game.  Great game to get people interested in non-mainstream board games.  Super fun the first 3-4 times you play until you realize that most people want to do the same thing and it's just a matter of who gets the cards to do it.

RATING: 7.5
I prefer Tower of Babel, but this is fine. There seems to  be almost too many things to keep track of, and this leads to a less focused game.

2017-09-16 : First play. Well designed, smooth flowing game which does have a couple of rules quirks : you can build more than once in your turn, but not offer crystals more than once unless you have a card for it, the distribution of crystals from dragon scales, only getting scales once from dragons present during a build, ... I'm sure they're all in there to cover edge cases where the game could become unbalanced, but they remain quirky stuff that you'd expect to be gone after further development of the game. Needs another play

This is an interesting race game/variable power/majority control game set in the Blue Moon milieu. Despite the name, it's not like Blue Moon (the card game) except for the art and the theme. So far I'm liking it a lot -- interesting choices and suspense throughout.

RATING: 6
This is a nice simplistic multiplayer game. Despite the fact you are competing against other players to win, you have to be cooperative to accomplish your goals, so you feel less like you've 'been had' by other players. The card mechanism is fun in that you have various suits of cards which have individual abilities and also are used as resources. The thing I disliked the most about the game is that it didn't come with enough crystal cardboard counters. Some argue there is a first-player advantage as well since there are no equal turns.

This is a nice, light game my wife and I both enjoy.  It is easy to learn and the components are very nice looking.  I like the fact that I can easily teach it to non-gamers who seem to also enjoy it.

RATING: 10
It's amazing how everything comes together in the game. There's area-control, resource management and a card-driven mechanic, which overall produces a game of remarkably varied gameplay. The game, though simple in rules, can be played "nicely" in a family atmosphere, but also appeals to more cutthroat play among gamers. The depth of strategy and tactics is amazing for such a simple game. Every turn, players make their plans on where to go, plans on what to build, and yet, they have to be prepared to change plans sometimes based on card draws and sometimes based on where they are vis-a-vis other players. If the game was just a straight-out grab for crystals, it might have suffered, but Knizia throws in the dragon scales and that adds a really neat twist into the game. Moreover, the artwork is very beautiful and makes the game pleasing to play. There's no pasted-on theme here. I really do get the sense I'm building the Blue Moon City playing the game. 
Update: What the heck, let's just give this game what it's worth, a 10.

RATING: 7
[1 play] Pretty groovy, even though we played slightly wrong--we didn't do the tile layout correctly, though I think it's an official variant.  Fun game with an interesting rhythm.  I was the only one who didn't get a bunch of loot on the first turn, but at a later point I was the only one who had a bunch of cubes out on the board.  You can spend a whole hand of cards having a dramatic extravaganza of a turn, and build back up either through bonuses, or by drawing cards as you spend turns not doing anything but moving.  
	The only thing I disliked about BMC was how loosely attached the theme was.  As so often happens, I was taught the game in a pretty themeless way.  I discovered from skimming the rulebook that there actually was a theme, and considerable backstory about the ruined city, but the theme was just provided, not made integral to the game.  I am even more interested now to play Blue Moon and see how it all ties together.

A very different game, and more enjoyable (but not enough to bring it up to a 9) with four people.  I did well enough, and was within two turns of winning when suddenly, well, I lost.   The kids enjoyed it as well, and talked about it throughout lunch.

This was rather shorter and lighter than I had thought after watching the tutorial on Board Games with Scott.  The idea might benefit from additional development to stretch the idea or perhaps fewer players to extend the number of turns (I played with four).  At the moment it seems like just yet another well-constructed but short set-collecting special-power boring-generic-fantasy-art card game.

I think I would like it better with a non-static opening board.  And I am in the camp that thinks the first player is advantaged, although my gaming friends disagreed.

This is a pleasant game with nice artwork, but there's a tendency for everyone to finish at just about the same time, so that it's mostly a game of efficiency with a significant first-player advantage (unless the others collude, which doesn't seem to happen with casual players.)  My wife enjoys it, so I play it fairly often.

RATING: 8
I suspect that over time this game's rating will fall.  It's great fun, but there doesn't seem to be any game-long strategy to it.  Also, most of the game seems to hinge on the last couple moves--and to depend on who has the most crystals during those last two moves--as the players stay neck and neck the majority of the game.  So players' moves for most of the the game seem to end up irrelevant.

However, game play itself is engaging.  The board squares are gorgeous, and the dragon-moving is entertaining.

Although I played badly, and luck of the card draw is a factor, I really enjoyed Blue Moon City. It played quickly and fairly easily (the dour colours confused me a little) and the decisions of the other players makes a big difference.

A nice mix of several "mini-mechanics" seamlessly flowing together.  The cards have a nice logical system - so learning what the cards do is surprisingly simple considering the various elements at play here.  The artwork on the cards and building structures are also well done.

It also plays in just under an hour.  A pretty delighful game that feels like a race to the finish.  Grade: B

This game seems very solid mechanically, but really quite dry.  Even the mechanics, which are born to be dry, feel too dry.

One of my favorite games. The variable board and route optimization elements hold special interest for me. This game is simple to learn, and yet holds a significant number of meaty decisions as the board situation evolves. Hand management, push-your-luck and outguessing your opponents all combine together to form a wonderful little strategy game with just the right amount of luck. 

People who enjoy strategy, abstracts, puzzles games and pick up and delivery should give this game a try when they have a chance.

Good family game.  Easy to learn (although non-gamers take a few minutes longer to grasp that some cards can be used 2 ways), visually appealing, nice subject matter, reasonably short, decent strategy, with some different & mixed game mechanics.  A pleasure to play.  Also one of my favorites to introduce someone to Euro games.  

R-playability is very high since the tiles can be arranged in almost infinite configurations.  The expansions are good additions to speed up the game and add to the possible layouts.

A beautiful game which has a lot of nice features but lacks in one which I value: interaction.  This is a beautiful, fast-paced and simple game which can be played by completely ignoring what the other players are doing.  If fact, it's probably better to do so and try to finish quicker than your opponents since what you can do depends on the cards you're holding.  There is some luck but the game is not entirely driven by that; sure you can draw just average cards, but overall, you do have some control over your fate.  Played a 4 player game and I can only imagine a 2-player game being even less interactive.  I'ld play again though.

I think I prefer it slightly with three or four, but my wife and I still love it as a two-player game. This is one of those where you have to be careful about handing a victory to the next player - I've done it twice!  

I made my own versions of the [thing=26189]expansion tiles[/thing] using the PDF available from FFG. The buildings' special abilities are cool, but don't have a large impact given their placement on the table.  Mostly, it's just nice to have a few more buildings.

I don't know what it is about Knizia's tile laying games, but I just like them. This one I loved in my first (and only as of this writing) play. I like the cutthroat element, which is "just right" for me (competitive, but without having to face total loss at any given moment). I like the way the card combinations work in the game, and the decisions you have to make about what to use different cards for, when. The number of different "abilities" the cards grant is, again, "just right" for me - not too complex or brain-burning, but important and interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This rating may go up as I play it more.  It's an easy to play game that has great artwork and is quickly learned.  So far I've been playing it as a family game with my kids and look forward to trying it out with my gaming group.  If it has a 'gamer' side it will be a favorite.  I prefer it to the card game Blue Moon.  

Update:  I don't get too excited about this game.  It seems like it's just a race game and the game is so controlled by it's system that it's always close at the end.  No sweeping plays here, just peck away every turn and see who edges ahead in the final turn.  Why play for forty minutes if you're always within three points of each other at the end? I'd rather just fast forward to the final turn and see who wins...

Also, the cards all seem samey to me because they are all good.  No clunkers to clog your hand.  A hand full of valid options is not as exciting as drawing the killer card you really need.  

Finally, the dragon scales seem like an added on complexity that is kind of a chore to keep track of. With the dragon scales Knizia has added too much stuff. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked the concept of the game, but didn't have much fun while playing it. I guess I just don't like games where you are trying to make plays that benefit your opponent the least. It is also hard to formulate a strategy for yourself when everyone's actions are influencing it.

The game design is solid and the art and components are all good, just not a game for me.

RATING: 8
aka THE MYSTERIOUS GAME OF MYSTERY(tm). Fun light-middleweight game set in Reiner's Blue Moon universe. It has nothing to do with the mediocre card game (Hi Joe!) Players move their pawns around a board and play cards to build pieces of buildings. When a building (card) is completed, players who contributed to putting it up get rewards. Buildings adjacent to other completed building give even more rewards. Rewards are or ultimately convert into crystals. The crystals are used to build the monolith in the center of the city. Whoever gets a majority of the builds in the monolith wins. The cards have special powers, and comboing those, along with some dragon play (a mechanism that a streamlined cousin of the clunky castle favor mechanism in Caylus) are the ways to win. It won't set the world on fire, but Blue Moon City is a decent pace-changer. Would happily play again.

RATING: 7
An original game that feels a little like Tower of Babel by the same author. You have to get in on as many constructions as possible. You'll also get points for building around already built buildings, so delaying construction may be good... But if you don't get the required dragon scales you're not in good shape. Lots of things to ponder and hard to play well, doesn't feel like the card game at all. Note that there is a bit of fiddling when scoring a tile as you have to move everything out of it, flip it over, and put the stuff back on... Also, it seems like it can offer an advantage to an early player in the turn since, in our games, two or more players can often finish on the same round.

Blue Moon City is a pleasant, medium weight building game. There is always a conflict between using your cards for building or for their special powers and some nice spatial restrictions as well. The game moves rather quickly and even speeds up towards the end, and it seems like somewhat of a race where there are always going to be several players within sight of the goal at the end and it's down to technicalities (and maybe a lucky draw or two) who's going to be the winner. It's short enough to not matter that much, though.

Nevertheless, it clearly shows some of Knizia's strengths: fast play with simple rules yet non-trivial decisions.

I love this game. I like the monolith-race, squeezing every last ounce out of your cards, the scale-race, and the easy-to-teachness. It is awesome with 2 players, but I'd like to try it with more.

My beefs with it are cosmetic and not game affecting. The art can get a little bit nipply, and the box-insert doesn't make any sense!

After three playings, is holding up well.  Fun and surprisingly interactive.  I think the system can be broken, but I'm not going to try since we have a lot of fun with it.


EDIT:  Bumped down a point.  It's just...so...damn...balanced.  At first, you're like, "Aw, man, I was one turn from winning!"  Then you realize...EVERY game...someone is just...one...turn from winning.

I like the Blue Moon universe, but for the theme it does suck to see it shift from "let's beat the hell out of each other" to "let's impress the provost (dragon)" with our l33t building skills...

I've always wanted to try BMC. I'm a big Knizia fan of course. Overall, there are lots of good ideas here. I like how the cards are used and the way the board works. The artwork is fantastic! For some reason, the game as a whole just doesn't gel together for me. There's future cities, dragon scales, icicle crystals that are offered to an obelisk, etc. Interesting mechanics, but probably one of Knizia's more sloppier pasted on themes. Plus, I think games should be a bit frustrating, but my frustration was constant on one thing: I didn't draw the right cards. This requires more tactical thinking than I think I was planning. Really, you can't have long range plans in BMC because it is almost entirely dependant on what cards you pull. Still, neat decisions here and there make this an interesting game, though certainly not one of my favourites from the good Doctor.

RATING: 6
With a few games under my belt I have to say that Blue Moon city is an exciting little hand and resource management/area control/nonlinear race title.   Blue moon City feels more intuitive than most games. Arguements may be made over strategies, but I find I am never really ever engaged in too deep of thought.  I don't mean to suggest Blue Moon City is ever going to be confused with a strategy game of significant weight, yet for a game in which most decisions are tactical (since the cards  dictate most moves) it sure provides a lot of pure tense fun.  All games are close, and it's always a nail biting dash to the obelisk at game's end. Scales well from 2-4.

Update:  After an initial onslaught of playings this one has been sidelined.  I still like the game for the most, but it feels too mechanical.  It is strange to suggest that a game with card draws being such a prominent mechanic can feel like it needs a randomizer, but that's the way I feel with this one.  BMC is a good opportunity for me to ponder why some like Knizia so much and are vexed by Colovini titles.  For some reason BMC reminds me of a Colovini game without the intereting twists.
Down 7 to 6.

UPDATE: now a six.  After a recent playing my opinion of this has really become ho-hum.  BMC is really an average game at best.

I was surprised how well the cooperation mechanism in this game works. Yes - you compete, and yet you must cooperate or otherwise you'll fail. A great idea and great execution.

The graphics is not for my taste but is coherent and doesn't bother while playing. Some may even like it.

Definitely a great family game that can be enjoyed by gamers as well. It's not a heavy-weight but for a 45 minutes of playing time it's a great choice.

Blue Moon City is a really nice package. 45-minute building game with a unique approach to the genre. Dynamic feel of the board, freedom of doing lots of different moves and an interesting balance between co-working with other players and trying to gain lead on them are it's main selling points. Seating order isn't as important as some comments make it sound like: after the first game strategy enters the play and the games are clearly win by clever moves rather than turn order.

My rating could go up on this one as this game has many elements that I like in a game.  Great artwork, excellent pacing, good hand management, variable set-up, and unique mechanics.  The idea of the dragon scales and how they 'reset' is interesting.  I haven't been a fan of the original Blue Moon game and expansions, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying this.  Looking forward to playing this one again.

Blue Moon City is a good middleweight Euro that offers a pleasant blend of fluid hand management, short-term planning, and collaboration.  The attractive art on the cards and tiles adds significantly to the game's appeal.  It plays quickly, is easy to learn, and scales well from 2 to 4 players (especially good with 3).  It's the brand of overall rock-solid game design that characterizes Knizia's best work.

I like the way that the scope of the game narrows as it progresses.  As more and more of the building projects are completed, you know the game is approaching its end.  Maybe you can see that you'll finish in two turns, but will that be fast enough?

My one gripe about Blue Moon City is that the players late in the turn order are unfairly penalized.  The game ends immediately when someone fulfills the victory condition.  If the first player wins, then she received the benefit of an extra turn.  More often than not, someone else would be able to finish if the game were to continue until the end of the round.  For families, this is not a problem.  Just let the youngest players go first.  But for gamers it's a big problem, and I think it needs to be addressed.  It wouldn't be hard.  Just play until the end of the round, with no limit to the number of slots on the monument.  Break ties according to the number of remaining crystals.  Early players would still have the first crack at the cheapest monument slots, but the big issue is the sudden death ending.

Knizia's original design for Blue Moon City called for all dragon scales to be discarded after each scoring - even the players who didn't get any points.  I definitely like this rule better than Kosmos' more forgiving method, and suggest you try it.

This game just seems nice and tightly designed and ..well .. fun. I love the fact that the cards with the lowest numbers on them have the best powers, so no matter what you have, you can't really get card screwed, you just have to combine several clever plays together to take advantage of whatever situation the board presents to you. The design is just ... pleasing to me somehow.

A game that is interesting yet fast paced and tight. 

The game has the curious element that you are working to get resources and you are then using those resources to generate points. The two step process makes the game just a little more about process than many resource allocation games.

It restores my faith in the church of Knizia.

This has become a go-to gateway game. There is a bit more to explain up front than some gateways (mostly because of the special actions for the cards), but turns are quick and people get the hang of it quickly. And it is very satisfying to finish buildings, collect crystals, and contribute to the obelisk...even when you lose. 

For me, I love the hand management. I love being able to discard to get rid of unwanted cards. I love the forced collaboration. Much to like in this quick, medium/light weight game.

RATING: 6
It is pretty dry as a game, but I really like the theme and the artwork of this one, how silly it may be seemed. This is a racing game with area control and hand management, where you have to have to have efficiency and timing. At first there might not seem to be much strategy to the game, but with repeated plays I have found there to be some tactics and strategy to the game; it is cleverer than meets the eye.

Works best with three or four players and can’t decide which I like the most. There isn’t enough interaction with two players, but I will play it with that number of players.

Fifteen plays. A fun tactical middleweight(ish) game based on the kick-ass card game. What makes the game interesting is that most of the cards are dual-purpose, and so players can use them to build or turn them in for some other advantage (increased movement, movement of dragons, et cetera). There's also some strategy involved in the decisions regarding the areas on which to focus, the pacing of one's expenditure of cards, whether one wants to spend a few cards and share profits or spend a lot and shut others out, et cetera. Another interesting facet is that the mechanisms of the game encourage players to stay in the vicinity of their opponents and react to their choices, so there's never a feeling of multiplayer solitaire. In the end, it doesn't quite have the depth of the best Knizia games, but it makes up for this by presenting the players with delightful (and sometimes agonizing) puzzles on each turn. One caveat: I preferred the three-player game to the four-player game, as the playing time of the three-player game was more in keeping with the weight, and I also felt like I was more connected to the other players. The two-player game works just fine.

There is an expansion with four additional tiles. It's not really necessary, but it doesn't hurt.

BMC is an excellent card driven board game.  A deft mix of area control, investment control, and a card driven mechanic reminiscent of Twilight struggle.

You don't have a great deal of decisions to make which makes for a fast paced game. There is nothing in the way of forward planning or different strategies to try out which limits its appeal to me. I really enjoy this one because the game generates a nice atmosphere. It does not scratch my need for a challenge but there are other games to do that.

I have only played this game two players and while it is enjoyable, there just isn't enough tension as often with four turns to go you can see that one player is enivitably going to win and nothing can be done to stop them. This will no doubt improve with more familiarisation to the game as this will mean that cards are better utilised and the game will become more cut throat. Having said that I think that the game will excell with three players and I am really looking forward to how it will play!

Having now played this game a few times, I think that I can now comment on it.  This game is *tight*.  It requires a good tactical mind to read all the possible combos of the cards in hand, *plus* time management, *plus* hand management, *plus* some strategic look-ahead.  At the same time, it doesn't feel like too much of a brain burner.  This game is in no way mechanically connected to the Blue Moon card game, yet it still manages to evoke the same great theme.

Played 2-player. I like the way the three different commodities (crystals, scales, and cards) interact and drive you toward the ultimate goal of adding to the central spire. There are nice options on using the cards, but in the end it feels like a race game. I look forward to playing with more people, where I think the game will play much better. *UPDATE* Played 4-player. Still liked it, the race aspect is much more apparent with four. One can't afford to stray too far from the pack. With more familiarity, this game could be played very quickly. Still good, but not quite great. *UPDATE* Played with 3. I think 3-player is where the game is best. It moved much more quickly, and everyone seemed to be in the running until the very end. Nice and tense. However, I'm sticking with the evaluation of quite good, not great. *UPDATE* Played again with 4, and loved it. Maybe it just takes time to grow on you, but I like this game better every time I play it.

An enjoyable card-based game, essentially involving collecting the right kinds of cards to then rebuild the various buildings in Blue Moon City. It can lack tension at the very end though as it is often clear who has won with a turn or two to spare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Blue Moon City is racing game with strong set collection card play. Collect cards to rebuild portions of the city all to gain resources that allow players to rebuild the central obelisk. There are many ways to gain various resources, but everything leads nicely to the final race goal of rebuilding the obelisk. On top of set collection, cards can instead be played for their abilities. Everything is easy to understand and the game is quick to play. Knizia's influence is easily seen, and Blue Moon City plays nicely and is engaging fun taking care of your actions an ensuring that they don't accidentally help your opponents.

I've been really enjoying playing this as a two player game. Turns are quick so there's little downtime. A nice mix of hand management and area majority. Every two player game has been really tight with the loser normally being only one turn away form getting his sixth obelisk offering. A very visually appealing game also.

An excellent card management and area influence game. Played a few times with 4 players, and it's usually very close. Have yet to try the two free expansions that I got from Spielbox magazin.

RATING: 8
Very interesting mix of resource management and area majority, with a clever 'get the dragon scales' twist.

One of the best accessible construction games -if not the best...

Superb buildings tiles, and quite nice card artwork -the same from the Blue Moon card game.
(ps: except for theme and the card art, it has nothing to do with Blue Moon)

RATING: 8
Innovative set collection game, with 8 suits of 'peoples' set in a fantasy world theme. Each card has different artwork, and each suit has different powers. The icons on the cards are helpful, so it is easier to remember what each does.

One of those games where you 'need' to do more actions that you can at any moment, in the race to garner points. I like the way that players can do more actions if they've gathered the right cards. It's just getting your hands on the cards that's the challenge often...

Steadyly growing on me... At first I thought it was too slitaire-ish, but there are qute a few ways to screw with your opponent, and we play with Knizia's dragonscale rules to make it more confrontational.
Good with two, but MUCH more interactive with 3 (haven't played with 4 yet). Amongst my wife's favorites (she loves those dragonscales :))

Only played one game with two players and it was pretty dull. I suspect it is much better with 3 or 4 players, but I doubt it will rate higher than a 7. Very popular with my geekbuddies, though, who are very critical reviewers (designers, reviewers and hardcore gamers).

Great medium-weight game, with simple rules but enough tactics to be enjoyed by gamers and families. It quickly became one of my favorites, although I wonder how much influence the theme and gorgeous artwork may have in that. The fact is that everything works really well, as you would expect from Knizia. My only concerns are the potential for kingmaking and player order advantage.

I originally got this game from winning a raffle from my LGS and it sat unopened for about a year.  I finally opened it and wow.  This has become one of the games I would play anytime anyone wants to.  I love the way its very strategic as you work to rebuild a city.  The cards are just works of art.  Best of all there is no dice. Definitly in my top 10.

Very nice game; tough decisions, pretty components, and fast-moving. Another good Knizia. I was hoping for another stellar Knizia, but I knew that this shared next to nothing with the original Blue Moon--so I wasn't too disappointed.
[EDIT] It seems to work really well, but it almost always ends with every other player one turn away from winning; that is not a good sign.

RATING: 3.5
Nothing really interesting here. Collect cards and use them to control buildings that give you scales or gems. Scales may bring you more gems and gems are used to make points.

On top of that boring stuff, you draw the cards from the top of the deck which adds a good amount of luck to this game. If played with more players, be sure to have a game of chaos and that you won't be able to plan ahead anything.

Better than the card game, but still not a good game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun game of maximizing your actions.  You are juggling almost all aspects (cards, tiles, cubes, dragons, crystals) to squeeze the best out of each turn.  Cards have dual uses and choices are difficult on how and when to use each card, with hand size being an issue.  Do you go in for some of many tiles, or try to get all the reward on just a few?  Contribute for victory now when it is cheaper, or take another opportunity to get resources, and maybe have victory contributions become expensive?  Go for that tile on the side and risk being too far to do anything good your next turn, or do something closer?
A favorite of my wife and son, it is often requested.  We've also taught it to my brother and his wife with good reception.

It's just a tiny bit too complicated to be a great game, but it is very good. For some, the complication of having special powers on every card can remain confusing, even after several games.

[Initial Impression: 5]  I'm something of a Knizia-holic, but I wasn't particularly smitten with this area influence/resource management/race game.  The most interesting aspect of it is that many cards have two potential uses: for the special powers, or for the face value for offerings.  A second interesting bit is that early planning for minority bonuses can pay off later in the game.  The strategy seems to be to go around seeding the board early with your offerings, so that you get at least some crystals when most city tiles score, choose a few high-value tiles to score highly in, and make sure to have at least three dragon scales for each of those scorings. Late in the game, a person can get a lot of crystals on other player's turns and then just head to the city center to build the obelisk.  (That worked for me, anyway.) I didn't like that once a lot of regions had scored, some cards suddenly became quite valueless, which virtually kills the hand management aspect.  Overall, the game feels like playing a shell game with the designer - what's important is building in the obelisk, but I'm going to distract you with these dragon scales and crystals and card effects.  If you can follow along, remember what's important, and exploit the trade-off ratios, you'll do well at the shell game. It will feel like a close race, as several people near the end goal simultaneously, but it ultimately seems like that relative closeness is contrived.  Interesting implementation, but the game doesn't have enough depth or fun to make me anticipate a return visit to Blue Moon City.

Lowered from an 8 to a 6.  For two main reasons - one, the person in our group who has the game is only up every few months and doesn't always bring it so I rarely get to play it.  Two, it felt too generous compared to other 8s I've given.

The tiles are randomly placed which can add to replayability but also frustration, and the cards can really just be stacked against you.  Other people may just get everything you need or things may just not sway your way.  I'd still play this one but I'd probably prefer something else.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game, My 1st Knizia - so that is pretty cool.  It seems  a lot better with 3 and I think even better with 4 ( not played 4 person yet ).  Cool Mechanics, co-op building and the completion bonus to everyone who helped rebuild it, I am sure a lot of strategy would come out with repeated 3 or 4 person games.  I rated it a 7.5, would go 6.8 for the 2 person version ( maybe lower, need more play time )

  Later on this one almost grows on me, it can be a lot of fun.  I have to laugh when people say this is not interactive enough, they might not be playing with the right group then, cause my group is all over this one ( so many times you get snaked on the one spot you can take near the end and then boom it happens again ( or you are forced to use way more cards for a lesser spot ).   Great Art work - the beautiful game!

Blue Moon City is a game where card accumulation allows acquisition of crystals, which in turn allows offerings at the Obelisk- the only points that matter in the end.

The trick is being in the right place(s) at the right time(s), with the right bonuses in play.

Basically the theme is rebuilding the eponymous City, where different buildings require different race resources - the cards.  Depending on the building and the bonuses from dragons and other completed buildings, the rewards for being part of the effort to rebuild can be small, or quite large.

Players can completely restore a building, or can contribute some of the resources and share the rewards with the other players assisting- of course those who do the most, get the most in the form of an addtional bonus.

Accumulated crystals allow offerings to the obelisk- and the player who makes the most or who donates a scaled number of times first wins.

I rated the game a 6.75 on 1st play (based on the printed ruleset), but after restoring the Doktor's risk/reward rules re: rewards for Dragon Scales I have increased it to a 7.

Efficient little card/board combo that plays relatively quick. Really like the planning required to finish buildings while being wary of others. Also like being forced to plan around the dead colors as the game progresses.

The only reason I don't give this a 10 is that games can be swayed by players vulturing the finishing of buildings with the 'teleport' card. And this is from someone who likes randomness and finds people who incessantly whine about any randomness in games really annoying egotists. 

Nice artwork on the cards, and overall great game.

Q:  What do you get if Nanking, Dresden and Hiroshima have an absinthe-fueled ménage à trois—and you and your friends were left to clean up the mess?

A:  [i]Blue Moon City[/i]!
  
As is usual in Knizia games, you typically want to do just one more thing per turn than you're allowed, leading to the agony of coming up one move short (or not) for the win.  The overall strategic feel is more parasitic than cooperative—figuring out how best to piggy-back on other people's hard work.

All our games to date have been very close... this sort of "many-stooges-through-one-doorway-simultaneously" finish makes for a tense (but fun) game.

While I was Air Marshaling on a transatlantic flight I had the chance to play this game.
Fantasy Flights ambition to create their own 'core' material is something that I both love and approve of.  Blue moon somehow managed to create a little universe with just a few decks of cards.  Blue Moon City adds just the right amount and gives a different flavor (Resource managment)to the theme.  I hope there is more to come.
Just as we were finishing up a terrorist jumped up and yelled something about canada, then he instructed us to please give him comtrol of the plane...he was so polite.

Great theme, great art, lots of strategy,  fun card game. It's actually a race with some area control and the degree to which you can rely upon other players to help you is quite important.  It is pretty light and perhaps less deep than it appears, but overall a very good gaming experience.

Los jugadores tratan de transformar sus cartas en recursos (cristales) para volverlos a cambiar por PV´s. Para ello emplearán los movimientos de su peón a través de edificios en ruinas para reconstruirlos usando cartas de 8 palos distintos (cada uno con propiedades específicas). 

Difícil clasificarlo en un único grupo de juegos porque tiene elementos de gestión de recursos, card driving game, mayorías... PROS:  Fácil y rápido de enseñar. El trabajo artístico hace que parezca un "compendio de monstruos de AD&D". La regla de vecindad (recibes bonus de los edificos vecinos cuando se termina de construir otro en el que tú has colaborado). CONS: Otro típico eurogame de transformar recursos en PV´s. Los efectos de las cartas podrían ser complicados recordarlos.

Blue Moon City is a pretty clever little game for four that actually rewards cooperative play. It seems unusually simple at first but there's some real depth in clever cardplay hidden away not to mention resource optimization. The way the cards work for the races reminds me a lot of Blue Moon as well which adds a little bit to the experience for fans of the original Knizia masterpiece.  I'm not too sure if BMC got robbed at Spiel des Jahres by Thurn and Taxis, but I do know that I probably wouldn't pass up a play of this game over most others.  The race for the obelisk every few turns is simply too priceless.

Update:  Bumped my rating up after a two player game and decided that BMC was robbed at SdJ.  This game is very good as a two player title, way more than I would have ever anticipated.  All of the mechanics feel tighter and there's a better sense of clever cardplay and tension.  It's OK for four, good with three, but downright beautiful with two.

I finally got a chance to play this one.  I was excited when it first came out, but then got disillusioned when I read the rules.  When I finally played it, it's not that bad at all.  It really is a neat hand management game that gives you many different ways to spend your cards.

Still, in the end, it just didn't do anything novel.  It was cute and enjoyable, but it didn't grab me.

I will say, it had *great* iconography.

Feb09:

Over time, I'd say all of the cards are equally useful.  There's not suit that I cringe about drawing.

Some minor points:

I have made the expansion tiles from the free downloads.  They're worth it, although the one that lets you draw extra cards might need neutered down to 1 extra card.  The others are fun and different.

I also enjoy Knizia's original rules about those with less than 3 scales during a reckoning getting nothing [b]and[/b] losing their current scales.


I almost [b]always[/b] discard 2 cards at the end of every turn.  I usually dig for some "3" value cards to make efficient building actions.  Other than that, I just like always sculpting my hand into what I want or need for the current moment.

There is an interesting cooperative aspect.  With multiple players it becomes an odd dilemma of deciding who to assist and who to mooch on.  There's not too many other games like that.

And above all else, my wife just loves that game.  It's very pretty and she likes the positive vibe that comes with building up the city.

There is also a pretty heavy skill quotient.  I've gotten noticeably better over time at efficiently using my cards.  I can constantly keep a 6+ card hand and still complete buildings every 2-3 turns.  It really keeps your options open.

Blue Moon City combines all the benefits of a mid-length Knizia game with one of the more interesting themes in the boardgaming world. The game works best with 3 or 4 players but even the 2-player game is interesting. Card management is the heart of the game, but there are a number of other mechanisms that add to the experience. As with most Knizia games, everything fits together perfectly. Perhaps the game's only drawback is that it always seems to end too soon!

seemed very tight tactically.  But sub-par play by one player will tend to setup the player to his right for victory.  This game is all about NOT handing your opponent a golden carrot which costs it a point.

inital rating 1 play 4 players..

This was a nice surprise although I did expect it to be good. Awesome artwork on the cards and variety in the way cards were played was nice. 4 players seemd great and I wondered how good it would be with less but I see people giving it the thumbs up so I certainly want to try it. Because of the majority aspect and how it is implemented I'm not sure 2 will be so good but will update after playing. The board is certainly big enough for four and our first game took about 45 minutes to an hour. 

Like most games of the Doc's a nice mix of strategy, tactics and luck making for a neat little game. Your game play is pretty limited to the cards you have but do you have some control over this and you usually have a few options to choose from. The game feels quite light but keeps you thinking and always looking for the most optimal move.

I think it plays better with 3-4 than with 2.  Your mileage may vary.

There's a lot of stuff going on - it can lead to a bit of AP, if you're playing with folks prone to that.

More fun than I was expecting, though.  And the components are really good.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (September 2014)

Ok game. I still haven’t played Blue Moon, but I really like games that continued the thematic setting of another game (still Blue Moon City is quite theme less as a good Knizia should be). I really liked the game components and the game art is ok. 

The game is very simple and you can teach it under 8 minutes. I like the area control aspect of the game. The game plays quick. Otherwise I would rate it a lot lower. It looks gorgeous on the table.

I feel Blue Moon City has lots of obvious decisions with your current hand, so it is pure tactics and I feel luck decides who wins most of the time. The most interesting decision is how you use your cards (as a number or as a power), perhaps is less random with 2 players only. Still I had a fun time playing it and I would play again if requested but it is way too light for my tastes and the luck of the draw seems overpowering. My GF like the game so perhaps I will buy it. 

Current Rating: 5.0

I like this game because it scales well and is fun even for two.  Twice in my few short plays I have had games handed to me on the last turn.  Someone plays something that gives me just enough crystals to teleport in for the win.  I guess that is a reward for having contributed in those areas but it makes me feel lucky just the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Players move their marker up to two spaces at a time around a grid of "destroyed buildings". Play cards to contribute to the restoration of those buildings. The same cards played differently have special powers. Highest contributor to each building gets the most reward.

The game is a combination of hand management through card drafting, and distributing your contributions most efficiently on the board.

Played about a dozen games now with just my wife. I can see where the strategy and dynamics would be significantly as a 3P game too. In any case there's a bit of Carc H&G in this (limited cubes, the ones on the Obelisk score the big points but you can't get 'em back) along with the "area majority" and excellent hand management possibilities.

So you get some leverage by manipulating the dragons well. And most of your leverage by making sure you get a cube in as many of the buildings being closed as you can.

With 2P it's about trying to finish some [i]valuable[/i] buildings solo, and making sure the other player can't. Also it pays to be cautious with your cards... there's plenty of real estate to work on and better to do it with efficient card combinations. (That's where timing visiting the obelisk comes in ... a chance to improve your hand while still doing something useful.)

With 3P or more I expect it'd be much more about getting in on more buildings (rather than trying to dominate them) and finishing buildings in a sequence to make the neighbour bonuses more favourable to you. Which would more often mean jumping in with less efficient card combos.

Very cool little game, Knizia makes another winner. The artwork is a 10, just superb, reminds me of MAGIC: TG with the use of different artists.

RATING: 6
I can see the fascination with this game... special powers for some of the cards, random set-up, a Knizia design... but, after playing, it seems to almost play itself.  My only win came about because the two players before me didn't claim an area that I needed for victory.

It seemed that with certain cards in hand, there ALWAYS seemed to be an optimum move.  I found that Masons and Thurn & Taxis had the same feel, but they were much more fun to play.  Every player has an equal chance to win, which is very typical of Knizia designs, but because of the card driven element, a run of bad luck can be devastating.  A decent SdJ nominee... but only a '6' rating from me.

Rebuild city, earn crystals, contribute to obelisk. A good game but slightly soulless. Cards used either for special powers or as money. It's essentially a game of optimizing what you're dealt, a "clockwork game". Enjoyable even though I don't think I am grasping the full strategy or even the tactics. (How does one calculate card optimization of the complex 'wheels within wheels' between tokens, scales, crystals, and neighborhood bonus, etc.?)  My wife likes that we're "rebuilding a city" rather than "destroying each other".

If we think of Keltis as Lost Cities in Irish clothes and not a truly original title, then Blue Moon City is easily Knizia's best design after his legendary designs from 2003 and earlier.

Probablemente es un buen juego de Knizia, pero ya tengo otros de este autor que me parecen superiores.

Es un juego de mayorías en el que mediante combinación de cartas consigues reconstruir las edificios de esta ciudad, y por ello eres recompensado con cristales, que te harán lograr puntos una vez hagas ofrendas en el altar.

Si el juego tuviera otra temática, como la reconstrucción de una ciudad tras un incendio o cualquier tema que tenga que ver con la construcción (sin tonterías fantásticas) ganaría bastante más.
[color=blue]
Maybe it's a good Knizia's game, but I have better games designed by him.

In this area influence game you have to manage your cards for rebuilding the city, and you will be paid with crystals. You will have to put thme in the Obelisk for getting points.

I don't think Fantasy theme is the right one here and, in my opinion, the rebuilding of a city after a fire would work better.

After the first game I wasn't convinced if I like this game. Move pawn, play cards, build something, take stuff. It first felt like a more confusing fantasy version of Ticket to Ride. Midway into the game the cards started to make sense and by the end of the first game a few clever combo moves opened the view on the potential of this game. Luckily, the game is short enough to directly play it another time and the second play is much more enjoyeable when you can play ahead a few moves. The game should offer enough subtleties (triggering scoring, alliance setups etc.) to provide a good replay value. I wouldn't mind playing it again. I don't feel the urge to possess it though. Only after the first play I noticed that we played with the four expansion tiles. They integrate themselves so naturally in the game that I have the suspicion that it was designed with them from the start.

As a fan of Blue Moon the card game, I was immediately intrigued by Blue Moon City the board game, and it doesn't disappoint.

BMC offers a tight, quick-playing design that plays easily in an hour.

Quick moving, easy to learn game.  I'm not as big a fan of the art as most are (I don't enjoy fantasy themes very much), and this really doesn't have anything to do with the Blue Moon card game, though certain cards do provide extra options.  Maybe I'll have to take that back, as it seems that a greater familiarity with the special powers may give you an advantage in the game.  With 2 players, I didn't see much of a use for the dragon scales.  I'll have to play it more to see if there is some depth that opens up with further play.  Initial impressions are that it is very light and simple.

A quick-playing influence/area-control game. Players run around trying to place markers around the city in an effort to rebuild it.

Artwork was gorgeous. Personally, I thought the building art was very well-done. The components were functional, just some cubes and counters.

An ok game. My rating simply reflects the fact that I'm willing to play this again to see if my bad feelings remain bad. It feels like there is an inbuilt kingmaker-mechanism at least in the 4-player and probably also in the 3-player game. Also there was a slight feeling that turtling could be powerful and cards include a minor lottery problem. I'd really like to try this as a 2-player game.

It is a race game about optimizing with the cards you receive. There is little in the way of tactics and interaction.

This game is nothing like Blue Moon but it is alot of fun!  I love thinking of all the different ways one can use their cards to do different things.  This game has alot in common with Knizia's Tower of Babel.

2016-04-03 - 7.5 - Much better than I expected after getting know the rules. Pretty quick, simple game, but you have quite a bit to think about here. I played with 3 and I wouldn't recommend it with two. You need to cooperate a bit to win, but not too much. I don't have many games which takes 45 minutes, which is another advantage of this game.

2016-04-10 - 7.5->7 - I played with four as well. It's good but ends a little bit too suddenly for my taste and I'm not sure about replayability even with random tile placement. Still good in it's category of gateway or end-of-the-evening-with-not-a-filler game.

2016-07-13 - 7->6.5 - It's fine but I prefer other games with 7. I got rid of this one. Ends too suddenly,

RATING: 7
Rules does not do justice to the game, which is a very tense race. Lots of interaction, actually is probably the main quality and flaw of the game, because in a 3-player game if a player is left out... He will lose. The cards are not colorblind friendly.

Buen juego. Aunque parece complicado enseguida se pilla la dinámica. Componentes chulos y queda muy vistoso.

Nicely made, though it won't go into my list of "must-plays."  It was an enjoyable game to play with my wife, though we both felt the card actions were a bit clunky.  The rest of the gameplay was adequate, though the mechanism probably could have been slicker.  Not bad for the price, and not particularly intense, so good for the leisurely-paced night of gaming.

Pretty good game about tightly optimizing your card plays. I have definitely seen the same phenomenon reported by others -- that in every game there seems to be a player who would have won on his next turn. That is, the games always seem to end up extremely close. This is kind of disturbing.

Cards give you multiple combinations giving you a lot of game within an hour.

RATING: 8.5
A concise game with a lot of decisions to make, since most cards can be used a couple of ways, and you always have decisions to make about what or whether to discard. Self-balancing, too, as the first player to finish a building creates more goodies for the person who finishes the building next door. I like that feature when I'm behind, not so much when I am ahead.

Blue Moon City: Expansion Tile Sets 1 & 2 (Print-n-Play) (2006)

Played this game for the first time last night, and really enjoyed it. It's just the right weight and length for a gateway or family game, and the artwork is simply stunning. It is a numbers game, but it doesn't feel as "mathy" as many other Knizia games. Our three-player game came right down to the last turn, and was truly anyone's game. I think BMC would start to feel too much the same if it hit the table every week, but I liked it and would enjoy playing it again.

Very good boardgame and quite different from the two-player cardgame, although the beautiful art work and intriguing fantasy world have been kept. Blue Moon City is Knizia's card-driven wargame with a nice twist: cards are used either for their "event" or their "ops value", but contrary to CDW the theme/story is rebuilding the destructed city and not the simulation of some war. Hand management combined with set-collection - use the dragons to your advantage! **** Plays very well with three or four players.

After a few plays I'm still not sure what I think of this game. It's nicely packaged and as is true with the card game, it's GORGEOUS to look at, but I'm not sure I get the big deal. You move, play cards that match the color you're on and get crystals (points). Then you turn in the points for end game credit. Here's the problem I have... it's all based on card draw but almost every move you have a way of getting a card match somehow. Every person is basically pulling in the same amount of crystals. In a four player game everyone comes one turn away from winning. It just seems like an excercise rather than a game. Also, the artwork as previously stated is Gorgeous but basically has absolutely NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CARDS OR THE GAME. See the numbers in the upper part of the cards? That bar of number and symbol is all you need. So basically you could play this game with pennies and a poker deck. I always feel a little cheated when I'm asked to pay $50 for something that can be compared to a game I made up as a kid using household items. There's got to be something better out there to play than this.

After two plays, I was ready to dismiss it completely. It seemed dull and repetitive, and the theme was bible page thin.

I was convinced to play it again and I'm glad I did. It's still repetitive and I still feel the same way about the theme, but the hand and board management are actually quite compelling. And what's great is that it scales perfectly from 2-4.

If I was going to outright complain about one thing is that there is a certain advantage to turn order. It often seems that once someone has claimed the victory that everyone else could do it on their next turn.

Hard to Find (Even online - get from BBG) - reprint coming!!

Blue Moon City - the board game - picks up where the two-player game, (Blue Moon), ended: the reconstruction of the destroyed city of Blue Moon. The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other. As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons.

RATING: 9
[2006.Dec.14] Another Reiner Knizia game that is surely destined to become a well-respected classic. This time he has provided us with transformation-style game with a twist&mdash;the game is a pseudo-cooperative. Players must carefully convert the cards in their hands into intermediary resources (these are "crystals" in the game, represented by thick cardboard disks). Proper hand management, board positioning, as well as flexibility are key during this step. These intermediary resources are in turn used to achieve the end-game goal. Naturally, the good Doctor provides us with more than one avenue to achieve this goal. With fast-paced turns, this game easily keeps players involved, and interested, in the game. Recycling the superb art depicted in the Blue Moon card game, the Fantasy Flight Games edition is a work of art in itself and is a pleasure to play. But don't be fooled by the title, because although the game is called Blue Moon City&mdash;other than this theme, and what a theme it is!&mdash;the game is very different from the Blue Moon card game. May the dragons watch you while you rebuild the City!

[2007.Jan.01] The addition of the four (4) expansion tiles (available from Spielbox Magazin; http://www.spielbox-magazin.de/smspecials.php) simply enhances the flavor, playability, and strategic "board play" of this game.

There not really long term planning, you just do what you have to do, the game ends and you end up winning without having a clue. Still I like many mechanics like the cards, the building construction and influence with each other. The yellow cards are useless to me and the fact that you could end the game sooner than filling the whole obelisk seems almost impossible. Still, I would change many rules including the fact that you can use dragons to attack buildings or other dragons and give another use to yellow cards. 

Update: I played another time recently (2016), I like the fact that the weak cards has special abilities to compensate for their lack of strength. That gives 2 use to cards. BUt I thinki there is just too many card colors. Else I think the mechanic I dislike the most is the donation to the obelisk, it's mosltly a matter of timing that determines the victory. I imagine it could be replaced with something else.

RATING: 3
Boring and dull.  The card "powers" are the most insanely boring card powers I've ever seen.  All you do is move around the board for three turns using boring powers and flipping tiles.

The tiles do look really nice.  I'm glad I tried Blue Moon after that, since it turned into my favorite game.  This one is NOT.

BM City is a card-driven building and influence game that has some multiple CCG-like powers/elements.  Some times it's better to build cooperatively with others and some times you'd do well to build solo.  It is a very enjoyeable dual-usage cards, area majorities game that scales well 2, 3 or 4.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
LIKES:

* Interesting conflict of using cards for their special action versus playing sets to claim various spots on the different locations to earn crystals which allow you to earn points.
* There isn't a necessity to win first place on the different squares.  Frequently, there can be great value just to be present, particularly in the mid to late game as other awards are available from completed tiles!
* Board changes each game as the tiles change from game to game - although each tile is always played.

DISLIKES:

* It doesn't bother me so much, but some people think there might be too much potential in luck of the draw that can mess over someone over the course of the game.  
* It does not play well with 2 in my perspective.  Play only with 3 or 4.  I will never again play with only two.

This is a very interesting game with an interesting and unique mechanic that drives the construction of buildings for rewards of various types.  Choosing which building to make your offering is often difficult as it often forces you to weigh the benefits of several competing possibilities.  Other tough decisions include whether to use a card for offerings or for its power, whether to discard at the end of a turn and whether to run to the obelisk to make an offering or continue making offerings at builings and gathering more crystals.

A complete success with my friends and cousins, it arrived thursday (August 10, 3 days before this words) and I've already played it 8 times.

Upgraded to 8: I've realized that if you don't play it for a few days it will be just as new and great as it was the first time. Still I need the expansions!

RATING: 6
The first few games of this felt a little anticlimactic.  One of the problems is that this game is just [i]too[/i] balanced.  In every game we've played, the loser would have been able to win the next turn.  While some might find this photo-finish ending a feature, it made the game feel pretty arbitrary to us.  Part of the problem is that the bonuses for actually completing the buildings with the most cubes are pretty small.  You just need to contribute just one cube to each building in order to reap most of the benefits when they get completed.  As a result, the two player game feels a lot like [GAMEID=17106], as you walk around contributing to buildings until finally someone has to complete one to get their cubes back.

Don't get me wrong, I think that there is a good game here.  Unfortunately, the problem is that the game feels like a light game, but is deceptively deep, especially for just two players.  Though it seems like the cardplay should be the major focus of the game, it's a much more tactical and positional game.  Since the advantages each turn are so small, in order to play well requires a lot of thought to optimize each turn.  It's the smallest efficiencies that can win you the game.

This is probably better with more people than with just two, when players can form shifting alliances to cooperate to finish a building to gain a clearer advantage over the others.

UPDATE: BMC is a fine game but after more plays feels the same. I feel its an excellent introductory game as it is very easy to learn.

Have played several games with 4 and one with 2. All are close affairs - have not seen anyone win by more than one cube. In 2 player game one must watch that you do not scatter your cubes - used both in marking your contributions to rebuilding various parts of BMC and for marking for victory. Since you have 10 cubes and need 6 to win in 2 player more attention is needed on this aspect.

Best of all, the people that I can game with the most often seem to like the game a lot. Rules are easy and play time runs maybe an hour or so.

Fundamentally a hand maangement game that plays quickly and has considerable balance.

The dragons are very cute, I enjoyed the theme, have only played the once, so definitely want to have another crack at it to see how I go a second time.

Provisional rating after one play. I was impressed by the nuanced elegance of this design, as well of the freshness of the overall concept. While BMC is an area control game, it is a distinctive and fun one. It was also a big hit with everyone else that played with me.

I look forward to playing this again very soon.

UPDATE: Up over a dozen plays now, and still enjoying BMC a lot. There are a couple of minor cracks in the facade, caused by the tightness of the race, though. Seating order and luck of the draw are looming as more significant factors. Hopefully they won't cause Blue Moon City to fall apart for me, because it really is a ton of fun.

I was looking for I slightly heavier 2 player game as 2 player games are the only variety i tend to play these days. Someone suggested this so I was torn between buying agricola and this. I ended up choosing this one as everyone says how well it plays with 2 (and also because I am a big Manchester City fan - for those that don't know, our fans sing the song "blue moon" (originally by the Marcels) throughout football matches and we call ourselves city. Come on city!). But after one play it seems dull dull dull. I will never play it again! Played Agricola last night - Fantastic! But I can't justify shelling out for Agricola now. I buy so many dud games!

Really interesting game. It's more a race than a developement game. The hand management is really interesting: do I use card for their values or their special abilities? My games where very close.

Update: this is a RACE! Don't forget that to win you need offering. Try to buy the cheap offering as soon as possible. Don't let anyone take 2 offering lead or you are doom to lose.

Update: a good game but a bit bland. You run around playing card and hoping someone will complete your building.

This was missing in Blue Moon (the original card game) - perhaps because I played this first.  Anyway, along with building, there is the special card powers which every card gamer loves - chaining effects for fun and profit.  Every game I've played has been close though - giving a hint that it is not too deep and that there is only so much you can do against competent players.  There is also somefirst player advantage, especially as the game often comes down to a race for the middle.  But once in a while it is good and I still look forward to playing it.

You are trying to rebuild a city through card play.  This is a board game variant on Blue Mood City two player game.  This was ok, I did not find the game that compelling but had some interesting choices.  

I don't think I would be keen to play this again though.  It is not a game I would seek out to play again.

The game was quite tense but I couldn't help the feeling that you weren't much in charge of the game. It was all random when 3 players changed to board before you and then you have to act to that situation with the cards you have. Definetly want to try again though.

Game of a great quality.
Simple and relatively fast game where you need to do as much as you can with limited cards and use as much as possible each power.  Card management game with strategies but with a lots of lucks since we are dependants of which card you draw. If everybody knows how to play, the first or second player who started the game is almost sure to win the game given no chance to the third or last player.

Knizia's usual mastery of games with very limited actions & optimization space (in contrast to the current fad of sprawling optimization games) makes this play very well. Trouble is, it's all about the fantasy Blue Moon setting that I really don't care for.

A seriously good game. Interesting decisions, turn angst, a well-defined goal. More tactics and opportunistic play than long-term strategy, but it´s a nice mix. I didn´t like the graphics at first but they have grown on me. 60 minutes with 4.

The word that quickly comes to mind when I think of this game is smooth. Very easy to pick up, plays fluidly, little downtime but the variety of possible card combos keeps the game interesting. Only real issue, which I haven't played enough to really know if it's true or not, is that it seems the first player has a small advantage.

Good
1. Can be a light game.
2. Can be an engagingly deep game.
3. Many options every turn.

Bad
1. Generally, you want to diversify your offerings. Players who complete entire buildings several times (3 or 4) usually loses the game.

Update: 7 » 7.25 I take back what I said about players completing entire building by themselves usually lose. I won tonight in a 2 player game, completing about 5 or so buildings all by myself and won the game. The game plan was calculated and game play was engaging. The amount of decisions required and the thinking process is awesome.

We do like this game, at least as much as Elasund! The dragons add a nice touch, and the VP style is fitting. In our first 2-plyr game, it pretty much came down to the last 1 or 2 plays of the game (ie the winner was decided on the last play, and if she hadn't won, I would have (on that exact turn)). Update: 4 player didn't end up being so confrontational. More of a race to get things done. I broke out early with three cubes on the pyramid, but then it took me quite a while to get my fourth. Ended up winning by getting the #12 spot, something I didn't expect to have to do. Still, quite fun with four.

Thought this was one of the better Knizia games I've played. It's light, plays quick, and has some good area majority control elements to it. However, I think that this game, along with most other Knizia games lack a certain elegance to them. For instance, in this game, they purposely made a shortage of components to limit players, however the player can go over this limit, and needs to use other objects to keep track of his bits. Game is just OK, I'll keep it for the light sci-fi theme.

I enjoy this game.  Its pretty light and has good replay value.  

The existing expansion tiles should be re-released as an expansion with some new tiles.

I keep thinking this would be a good game to re-theme for international espionage. Players could work contacts on each tile, calling in satellite surveillance for evidence tokens.  Different card colors would represent different types of contacts you could work over for information.

There was so much potential for this game to be absolutely dripping with theme... but instead the game play seems mathematical and mechanical to me.

Another hit with my game group. I won the last game (I think) using the following strategy: maximize crystals first (by way of neighborhood bonuses, but don't spend too many cards trying to own everything or get dragon scales), then don't tip your hand as to when you're making contributions until you can make two at a time, preferably more than once.

One of Knizia's more unique designs. A quick-paced and beautiful game with a charming and very well-suited theme, which is quite a pleasant change from his other titles. Simple but rich and very well streamlined mechanics marred by an unfortunately high luck factor. Short downtimes, fast session times, involving and strategic but not brain-burning, thematic but game play and mechanics over theme; there are few things to complain about and much to praise. Recommended.

New in collection april 07. 

Initial rating after one 2-playergame:
OK Family style Eurogame. It's a Knizia, so as usual there's absolutely no connection at all between theme and gameplay. Probably not a gamer's game, but still ok to play. Initial game left me a lukewarm, probably more fun with 3 or 4, so rating might go up eventually.

Update: after buying a lot more games that I really like I don't think I can't be bothered too much with another soulless Knizia. Traded away.

NL: Tactisch spel met raar spacethema. Spel zit wel goed in elkaar, maar moet je denk ik met 3 of 4 spelen om het echt spannend te krijgen. Alleen nog maar met 2 gespeeld.

I liked the game a lot, there is a lot of angst in deciding where to go and how to best spend your cards; the way you can sort of plan a couple of turns ahead but not quite, and how you sort of want to spread out but also want to concentrate on a few tiles. Knizia, as always, did a very good job of setting up competing objectives for players. I was a little turned off by the end game though and the quest/rush by all the players to get that last crystal. It felt like the luck of the draw was paramount to be able to get the right cards to complete that last offering. Looking forward to more plays and see if the endgame feels any better.

Traded Jul2016:  OK game, but after several plays, just didn't find the game especially compelling.  Many of the games I played ended with very close scores.  Very much wanted to like the game more than I did given the setting and artwork.

Looks fantastic.  Essentially a race game with a heavy emphasis on resource management.  Might not sound compelling, but found the game surprisingly enjoyable.

A fun game with some nice hand management. I'm not so sure about it, though. The game often ends with one or even all players one turn away from winning. Over as many turns as there are in this game, it's hard to believe it's just a very tight game. It would seem luck could swing such a close outcome. I wonder if almost any option in the game is as good as any other.

RATING: 7.5
Review after my first play: I'm not sure what to say about this game - it's an area influence game combined with a hand-management-focused cardgame; I found it hard to strategize during the game, partially because there were so many colors of cards and so many options for how to use them (and it was so difficult to get sets of similarly-colored cards).  Unlike most Knizia games, I didn't see a clear set of paths that all could lead to victory - instead it felt like I was wandering through a forest stumbling along trying to get crystals and scales without a clear idea of what was the best way to do it.  Needless to say, I lost.  I clearly need to play this more, but right now I wonder if the hype is based more on the fact that the artwork is from Blue Moon or that the gameplay is actually that great.  

After the second play: While I understand more about the game (and the hand management and functions of the cards make more sense), I still seemed to be a few turns behind my competitors.  This definitely seems like a game where a couple of people can team up and help each other, which is probably not ideal.  I definitely enjoyed it more, though, and want to try it again.

After the third play: I'm starting to get the hang of this more; choosing which tiles to flip is clearly key, and is nicely tactical (as what everyone else is doing necessarily dictates where you go, as already-flipped tiles give you bonuses).  I've also increased my ranking from 7 to 7.5.

RATING: 8
This is after one play.  I enjoyed it and it has a unique feel.  I'm not sure if the payouts on the buildings are unique enough to matter where you build, so it amounts to just using what's in your hand.  Certainly more plays will tell if this is the case.

The cards are too complicated for us simple folk to read.  I could't figure out what card did what when it came to the wild cards and special brown cards.  Aside from that, most of the movements don't matter because scoring is based on building oblisks and the person with 4 built wins regardless.

As for the card game, the artwork is just gorgeous. Regarding the gameplay, I think it is easy to explain and the first rounds' pace is slow enough so that everyone can understand how it plays. But at the end of the game, each of your choice has such a waterfall effect that you might want to think twice before choosing which tile to play.

First impressions are pretty good. The game components are beautiful (except the dragons, which are thick solid brightly colored plastic.) The gameplay is pretty easy to learn and has some strategy and planning, but isn't overwhelming.

An appetizer but not the main event.

We're liking this more as we play. We play with the 4 bonus tiles every time now.

Blue Moon City has become one of our favorites, much to my surprise.

Excellent game: challenging, with nicely intertwined mechanics and lots of meaningful, mostly tactical decisions to be made. I like the recurring game-within-the-game battle for the most dragon scales. The fact that it's so tied to an unengaging (silly really) fantasy storyline does not detract from play. Graphically, the unfinished sides of the building tiles are much more attractive than the dreary looking finished sides. The file of alternate set-ups provides welcome variety. [11 plays]

This is a very addictive, interesting and brilliant game. It plays very quickly, it is highly dynamic, and it requires keen observations and tactics. It rewards clever play. I am drawn to it frequently because it is just plain fun! We tend to play with the completely random tile placement variant.

It's a solid and somewhat quick game. Not overly exciting, and the theme seemed a bit much and didn't really add to the game. I'd hate to say a "paste on theme" but....With the size of the board it tends to have a positional king making effect. Or at least it had that feel in a four player game, where you're playing and helping other players. You are mostly at the mercy of the card draw, but i like the fact that painful decisions are required when you need to play "more for less". Also has good tension, and a bit of press your luck when it comes to should I keep going or should I stop and buy crystals. Overall not a bad game

My wife really likes this game so that alone makes it worth owning.  The player interaction is low so my son didn't care much for it.  Even though I like many multi-player solitaire type games, this one wasn't quite as interesting as many others.  I tend to prefer games in which decisions made in earlier turns affect your long term strategy.  In other words, Blue Moon City is more about short term tactics and less about long term strategy.  Being able to analyze the current board position and make the most of whatever cards you have is the name of the game.  The good news is that it plays fast and usually results in close finishes.

Un jeu amusant, facile et rapide de Rainer Knizia. Un genre de mixte entre un jeu de carte et un "city builder". Les mécaniques sont originales, le jeu est facile à enseigner et agréable à jouer. Ce n'est pas le meilleur jeu du docteur Knizia mais c'est un très bon jeu.

RATING: 8.5
After just one play (plus a solo game to learn the rules)... brilliant game. A great game where there is a lot to think about. Cards are very well balanced and you are constantly faced with interesting choices of where to build and what cards to use, which to hold onto for future turns and which to discard in hopes of getting better ones. The game is both thematic and yet mathematically elegant. One nice feature I like is that the game doesn't feel as "mathy" and dry as some Euros can sometimes feel (especially from designers like Knizia). This is a good solid family style game but yet definitely has appeal to the gamer type as well. I feel the game has a pretty wide appeal as it's solidly in the middleweight category and another plus is the rules are very simple to learn and teach. The only part you really need to cue in on is the various card powers which takes a bit of explaining but if you keep a player aid or 2 handy for the players the first time they play... these will be learned very quickly. There are just enough card powers to make the game interesting and diverse without swamping players and making things overly complicated and slowing pace to a crawl. A balance that many other games fail to achieve.

The first game or two, players will certainly have to think about their actions and best moves so there will be some downtime but that will go down as players learn what cards to use and what actions to take at different stages of the game.

All in all, one of the better middle weight games in my collection and I can certainly see my rating possibly rising to a 9 with more plays. I can't see a rating drop below 8 at this point as the game play is the type that appeals to me... quick, yet interesting with multiple considerations to think about every turn.

A real gem, and deceptively tight as well.  The use of placement cubes as scoring markers is a neat way of restricting the more successful players and usually ensures a very close finish.

In this Knizia game, there are 21 tiles. Each tile has one or more numbers with the color of cards that can be played on that tile.  If you play the right number and color of cards, you can claim one of those numbers by placing your cube there. Once the numbers are all full, the tile is scored like an area control mechanic: the first place player with the most cubes gets a certain reward, but all players will get a reward just for being present. The rewards are getting more cards, crystals or dragon skin. Crystals allow you to put cubes in the obelisk, where you need 4 cubes to win. The cards represent the races of Ble Moon (eg Flit, Aqua, etc) and some cards give special abilities eg the '1' Flit card allows you to move your token anywhere on the board, the 1' Aqua card allows you to move the blue dragon, etc. The number of dragon skin you collect allow you to earn more crystals. This is a good fast paced game that easily plays in under an hour, with the tension increased as each opponent gets closer to the victory conditions.

A typical Knizia big-box game -- heavily playtested, plays well, interesting decisions, but... also has an abstract and mechanistic feel.  There seems to be no real connection between the game itself and the pretty pictures on the cards, and this turns me off.

When playing a 1-2 hour boardgame, I prefer to play something with an actual theme, so I prefer Knizia for his cardgames and fillers where the abstractness of his designs doesn't bother me.

I think Herr Knizia's latest designs are getting a bit too subtle for my taste. I can see that this is a very nice, well-rounded design, and also that there is some depth behind the seemingly simple gameplay. But still the overall experience gives me the feeling that this is a series of short-term, rather-obvious-for-what-it-is(or in other words, hard-to-predict-the-future) optimisations, which is a bit disappointing for me.

RATING: 9
Very clever game featuring interesting choices on every turn and with a pretty quick play time and pace.  Though completely different from the cardgame of the same theme, Blue Moon City manages to capture some of the experience of its counterpart through multiple uses for each card, challenging the player to decide what the best way to use his resources is.  High recommendation.

---update---
Great game, and incredible with 2 players.  Two player game has a very different feel from 3 or 4.  I still feel 3 is the sweetspot, but 2 is incredible in it's own right.  Slightly disappointing with 4 just because it doesn't give the same intensity, both due to less control and quicker finish.

Bumped up to a 9, with the sole factor keeping it from a perfect 10 being the less satisfying 4 player game.

----Update
It was inevitable.  Bumped up to a 10.  It is that good.  The 4 player games are much better when all the players are experienced.  Not quite as awesome as 2 and 3 players, but still very excellent.  Bravissimo, Herr Knizia!

My biggest problem with BMC is that it desperately tries to be something else than it actually is. Essentially, it is an abstract card game (anyone notice Knizia's name on the box?) with very low level of player interaction but there is a lot of noise around that concept, trying to make the game look something different. The beautiful art, minis, background story, tiles, chits, etc. managed to fool me back in my novice board game geek days so yes, that makes me even more bitter after seeing through this charade. Boring.

Beautiful game, easy to teach and very entertaining.  With the random placement of the buildings, plays will differentiate from each other.  Even non-gamers can enjoy it.  Absolutely recommend and what do you know, it shines with two-players.

My only concern is that the game has been specifically designed to be a close-race to the very end.  Every game I played ended with the winner just one step ahead of another player.  It felt a little bit artificial if that makes any sense.

Update:  I heard that the "artificial" close race was made to make the game more casual and friendly.

Update 2:  The OOP status of this game led me to find another game with a similar mechanism that might be overall better:  Istanbul.

An interesting game of hand and resource management. However, the problem with this game is that the person who goes first has an absolute advantage.

Blue Moon City is a good game, but an unremarkable one. It has a mix of good mechanics and doesn't make any missteps, there just isn't anything that really blew me away.

BMC's particular fantasy/sci-fi theme could have been anything and really doesn't add to immersion.

Its a pretty easy game to learn, the only sticking point is the card powers, some of which aren't exactly intuitive. A few minor tweaks to card iconography could improve understanding.

I'm gonna hang onto BMC until something better, with similar mechanics, comes along.

It's a hand management tactical card game with reflections on a random tile-made map that plays out very fast.

The theme is paper thin, as with most Knizia's, but this one has high quality components and superb illustrations that make up a bit for it.

It's a light gateway-like game, but still, your hand of cards allows you for some options and some minor medium term planification (that will go awry half of the times, especially with 4 players).

It has attractive mechanics that mitigate the luck factor and intense interaction (no direct attacks, but you compete for the board spots and at the same time, you need your rivals to fill your tiles; you'll lose if you go your on way).

There might be some issues with players getting advantage from moving first/last in a round but game is short enough to make it a non-issue. Games are almost always very tight. Someone could say too tight since sometimes it feels it is very small things that decide the winner in the end if players are even remotely of same skill.

RATING: 7.5
Easily one of the most gorgeous games ever made. Both the cards and the districts are attractively illustrated. The pawns, the dragons, and the chits add their own individual beauty to the game, and add to its fantasy-otherworldly feel.

The game play is interesting, in which players can focus on their own agendas or be forced to react to another's actions. This is mainly a tactical game, and I have yet to find any long-term strategies that could work within its scope. If it had those, then it would rate higher in my book.

Essentially a card game of very tight and intense hand management. Progresses swiftly. The theme is very thin. Best with four players.

I was a bit wary about the recycled graphics at first, but luckily they don't interfere with the gameplay.

Fairly quick and simple - once you work out all the rules for the colours. Players can be greatly limited in choice each turn, but then part of the strategy is balancing constant progression without running your hand size too low.

Another one of those games that has grown on me over time.  This game rewards creative, efficient use of cards, mitigating some of the randomness.  Also one of the few games that regularly has close margins of victory in the endgame (that is, where often at least one other player was a turn or two from winning.)

RATING: 5.9
Ambientato nel mondo fantasy questo gioco di Knizia ha il pregio di un regolamento snello e una durata contenuta; il gioco risulta comunque non privo di strategia anche se la continua pesca delle carte aiuta il più fortunato. Penso manchi un bilanciamento nei confronti del primo giocatore che di fatto ha una mossa in più; per il resto è fluido e lineare anche se probabilmente non regala tanto pathos.

RATING: 6
My impressions are that, while this one is a lot of fun, the majority of in-game decisions are rather obvious, resulting in a somewhat limiting strategy. Any player interaction is coincidental more than deliberate or planned. What I do really enjoy is the extension to the Blue Moon story, which shows a most un-Knizia-like playful imagination, and of course the fabulous card art carried over from the original game.

Further Thoughts - I'm finding it harder and harder to really enjoy this one. There just doesn't seem to be a proper game in there.

A fun little tile flipping game. I'm not in love with it, but it's one I'll play quite a few times without complaining.

Verdict:

What I Like: Easy to teach, fairly quick to play. Great card artwork, and the fact that no two cards are the same is fantastic.

What I Don't Like: It can feel too simple. The last few turns are spent hoping you get the card draws you need to win it and/or your opponents do not. Therefore a win rarely feels entirely earned. Though well drawn, the tiles color pallet is bland and uninteresting.

[b]Blue Moon City[/b] was sold via auction 8/8/15.
Received in a trade 10/31/14

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This one started out strong and ended up fizzling out after more plays. What really soured me on the game was the lack of variety in how the game played out. Even though the layout of buildings changed from game to game it really didn't change much. It basically just meant you were looking for different colored cards to play. The 2p experience was okay, but there was a lot less conflict over who was going to build each building and the game devolved into a race with a predictable outcome of who would score the last cube in the tower. 

It sounds like I really don't like the game, which isn't true, I'm just not interested in keeping games in our collection that will only get played once or twice a year and that's about how often I'd want to play BMC. However; if someone else pulled out a copy I'd happily play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I love the artwork on the tiles (the buildings), most of the characters (there are a few that I really don't care for) and the dragon pieces are great.
- Plays well with 2, although it does become even more of a race where you may try to build each site on your own.
- An interesting twist on area control, since you can build where someone else has you may be able to share in some of the benefits for building that site.
- Dragons: the addition of the dragons/scales adds another layer of depth to the game because you can get quite a few crystals if you have the majority of scales.
- Cube management: my son and I played a 2p game and I almost lost because I did not have a cube left to build in the temple.
- Hand management and all the different card powers/combos.
- Random tile layout: This really changes how you play the game since getting adjacent building bonuses can be very important.

This is an excellent game that really deserves a reprint, I really haven't played anything quite like it.[/i]

I really don't get it. I don't like the winning criterium. Imagine you winning Power Grid by powering only five cities. I mean, it's too much effort to score 1 point and then everyone is running for the 5th. point anyway. I don't know if this is clear, but that is what I feel.

Knizia is still the best, but this I pass.

Игра оказалась смесью карточного филера и строительной игры. Большой процент случайности при вытягивании новой карты. Как стратегия - игра довольно проста и не напряжна для мозгов, что делает ее приятным  семейным занятием для будничного вечера после трудового дня. При этом игра азартная и хорошо оформлена. Высокий уровень реиграбельности Жене она чем-то напоминает монополию,  а мне Русское лото. Игра более экономическая чем фэнтезийная, но сказочный дух все-же имеется. Будем играть еще.После распечатки дополнительных 4 карт играть стало еще веселее, хотя стратегический элемент снизился еще больше..

RATING: 7
A neat race game. Multiple card powers create interesting decisions each turn - do I use them to get cubes on the board (which will eventually give me the crystals I need to score a VP) or do I get more benefit from using its special power somewhere else. The special powers can also provide ways to get onto cube spaces (which may be about to score) that you may not otherwise have been able to because you lacked that colour. So theres's a nice decision to make each turn on how to blow your cards ... or conserve them for later wiser use and simply draw more for now. The trick to the cube building is to offer enticements so that other people will help you out (because they only score when completed), and that scratch my back, scratch your back feel is nicely different from other games. An enjoyable card game with oomph.

RATING: 5
"Pretty but mostly abstract game heavy on competitive collaboration. No attacks, but has area majorities and leeching, which I dislike."

What I like:
- Learning 4p game only took 60 minutes
- Interesting and clever mechanisms
- Each card can be used for its value or its ability

What I don't like:
- Majority scoring
- Competitive collaborative building
- Felt longer than 60 minutes
- Spend cards to place cubes to complete tiles to get crystals to build the obelisk (meh)

The game was about what I expected. It has some clever Knizia rules, but the stuff I dislike overpowers the stuff I like. I would probably put the weight slightly higher than the BGG-voted 2.3. I would give it a 2.2 for complexity, and a 2.7 for depth.

RATING: 8
Very nice sequel to the original game, that emphasizes a completely different gaming mechanic and is played by up to 4 players. Combine the different powers of the Blue Moon Peoples to rebuild Blue Moon City. It's cool how Knizia came up with the thematic powers and integrated them into a different game style.

- Rules are well structured, easy to learn and quickly explained.

Love the artwork.  I like the way it uses the Blue Moon stuff in a very new way, but keeps the personality of the Blue Moon peoples intact.  The Flit, for example, can fly around the board.  I also like the colors: purple, white, grey and baby blue.

The point of this game that is interesting is that you can't easily win on your own.. you can do better by piggy packing on  other players' buildings. But this tends to make the game very close.  The game is decided by who can get to the obelisk first. 

Update: This game didn't have legs for me.  I'll happily play it if someone brings it along, but I traded my copy.  Nowhere near as brilliant as Blue Moon, that's my main problem with it. I guess, given the theme and art, I wanted a multiplayer Blue Moon.

A light Knizia romp through an interesting fantasy theme. You basically just move around the board playing cards to collect crystals to build the obelisk.

This is a fun game, don't get me wrong, but it's so excruciatingly balanced that it all comes down to nickel-and-diming your opponents for the win, which certainly isn't very enticing a prospect.

Tentative rating. I'm still not sure about this one. It's got pretty pieces and simple rules but I fear that the first player has a big advantage on the 2p game. It's a weird game and difficult to fully understand. I need to play it more. Rating may go up or down. 
[UPDATE]: Played another 2p game in which the 1st player lost badly. My fears about 1st player advantage vanished. Rating went up (7.5->8).

The board (or tile area) seems rather crowded and so that really nothing can be achieved in game but it's not. Rebuilding the Blue Moon city is fun and competitive. Sometimes it can be rather harsh (I had no victory points in my first game because I was too greedy and didn't get them before the game was over). Dragon figures are quite high quality and game tiles rather simple but still do their job.
Clearly a game worth trying!

Had a lot of fun playing this one. The dragons are cute, and add an interesting element of strategy to an otherwise routine route optimization and hand management game. The art on the cards is good, but weird, and fits the background of the game world. Each of the factions has its own distinct feel, making them a welcome change from the Borg like sameness we see in other games. I also like the semi-random setup of the board, as it lends itself well to repeated plays. 

When I first saw this game, my initial thought was "Thank god; no elves, dwarves or hobbits." I'm so sick of seeing fantasy worlds based on Tolkien's writings. No offense, but I like J.R.R. best when he stays confined to his books. The man's dead, so let's leave him alone already. 

When someone asked me to describe Blue Moon City to them.  I said: "It's a race game, where you scurry around rebuilding a city, and you use cards as the building material. The dragons like to watch you do stuff, and reward you if you please them. Sounds a bit kinky, but its a lot of fun." 

Blue moon city IS a bit kinky, but in a good way. At its best, it tickles your brain, and satisfies that urge for non-confrontational competition. The weird theme and art may throw some people off, but the game is well worth learning to play.

meh... not so sure about this one. Feels really dry. You're using cards to reconstruct buildings and earn dragon scales and crystals. The crystals are used to make offerings and the person who makes the most offerings win. Not particularly enamored of the theme and I question whether this game has very much replayability.

This game has stood up under repeated plays.  The rules are simple and good moves are usually pretty easy to find, so it's easy to get new players (even non-gamers) into the game.  However, it does what most simple games cannot: Creates a tense play atmosphere with plenty of meaningful and difficult decisions.  This is everything a middleweight game should be.  Beautiful bits add a lot of atmosphere.  I'm starting to wonder how big the luck factor can be, though; at first it seemed like wise playing could overcome bad draws, but it seems like even bad decisions can't stop a good draw from winning.

I've only played twice, but I like this game.  There's a heck of a lot of good things to think about without being too abstract or boring.  There's also many different strategies to adapt and games (2 player, anyways) have always been close.  I'm really looking forward to playing this game with more players - say, a total of 3 or 4, because I'm sure the mechanics would really change.  

If I could say anything about the theme in this game, well, this game eats pixies and craps fantasy.  I gotta admit, it IS kinda weird sitting around the table, and telling people they have to use dragons to get enough dragon scales (or whatever they are) so you can appease the mighty obelisk.

Gameplay is fantastic and accessible, with the multiple yet simple functions of cards creating great choice opportunities for players.

This is an older classic of a game. For me it just didn't hit the mark. It has a lot I do enjoy like Dragons and hand management. I just can't get behind helping others to help yourself. I am very much everyman on his own. I don't play well with others. :P For me I don't feel the need to play it again. The ending drew out too long IMO and by then it was apparent who was going to win. Ah well, I would try it again but it is not high on my list.

Mentally, I enthusiastic with the design as it has many elements I look for: the deck distribution is uniform so easy to remember, winning condition is "first to" (placing a set # of cubes) which is visually monitored; each game is randomly laid out so this and cards picked keeps the game play different and refreshing. For such a relatively simple gameplay there are subtleties to explore: hand card management (speculating and discarding), cube management and the subgame race for dragon scales as an alternate route to pick up crystals. Update: I don't know, I think emotionally I'm starting to go cold on Blue Moon City. The fantasy theme is offputting, explaining the game and the card effects is offputting but the cooperative involvement in building can be more offputting as there can be kingmaking situations.

This is a good game for casual gamers as it is hard to play badly and is tense up until the very end. I find it almost too balanced though, almost as if your choices don't matter. This could be less the case with 4 players but certainly felt that way with 2 and 3.

Box has slight water damage.

The game and theme fit well with the Blue Moon world however the real question is: how does Blue Moon City stand as a game? Unfortunately it is not very good. There is minimal player action and the game is simply a race to collect different sets for scoring. It is similar to DoW's Cleopatra in many areas but does not excell at any of them. Where Cleopatra offers choices, the play in BMC is obvious. Interaction is minimal and choices even less. Without the Knizia name and the Blue Moon tie-in this game would have been soundly trashed. Dull.

 A super fun and creative game, one of the best by the genius game designer, Reiner Knizia.  Outstanding components and atmosphere, a science fiction/futuristic city needs to be rebuilt. The game play feels like you are always accomplishing something, and the games feature semi-cooperative play and seem to be close and competitive until the end. There is something special about this game that is hard to put into words, it should be in every gamers collection!

1 play, 3 player, under an hour.

Interesting mix of hand management and ability to use cards in one of two ways (one to progress to your goal and the other to modify the rules in some fashion). Card play is fairly quick once you get used to the card mix. The card turnover is almost too fast causing a bit of fiddliness when combined with turning over the board tiles after comleting a set (and having to return the player marker and any dragons back onto the tile). Light and fun all the same.

A nice board game sequel to the excellent Blue Moon card game.

Interesting game which could do with a bit more randomness even and diversity in cards and tiles, but I presume the designers tried to keep it simple. I found it odd (not bad mind you) that the game becomes easier in terms of resource abundance and possibilities. Yet, due to the fact that this goes for all players the race for the win becomes really fast towards the end instead of weighing and slowing down in the end like many other eurogames. The theme is terrible, generic semi-fantasy, a bit more effort would have been appreciated. Will definitely play again to see how it holds up.

RATING: 8
Pros:
 * Setup is pretty quick and the game plays quickly with little AP.
 * The dragon-scales "mini game" is fun and reminds us of the 1-through-6 "mini-game" in Finca.
 * The powers of the cards are simple to understand but also able to be used in clever combinations, giving you the ability to mitigate the luck of the draw.
 * Giving the lower numbered cards the better powers makes for some difficult decisions.
 * We're particularly fond of games that have an "achieve X and you win" goal; you could have a huge stash of crystals and still lose this game.
 * The game is well balanced and an early lead doesn't result in a runaway leader.

Cons:
 * Four of the tiles are supposed to be placed adjacent to the obelisk in the center, but they aren't marked. If you keep them together when you put the game away, it's not an issue.
 * The game is a bit "fiddly" and you'll find yourself needing to be a bit careful when calculating and handing out rewards, flipping tiles and putting pieces back. It's not a problem, but you may want to assign a "banker" who pays attention to details.

Played again for the first time in almost 5 years. This game has aged very well and is making me question why I bother keeping so many more recent games.

One of the first designer games I purchased and still one of the best. Bumping the rating.

(moved session comments into play log)

= 2013-01-15 - R: 7.5

Purchased this game way back in April, 2012 and we finally got around to playing it two days ago.

Many reviews for this game mentioned that it often came down to a single turn or a couple crystals. Our first game certainly lived up to this.

We played our second game last night. As a strong indicator of how good this game is, we found ourselves thinking about it quite a bit over the last two days. I'm curious what the long term replayability of the game will be.

Starting this one at 7.5.

Read the rules and a few reviews. After realizing that we dislike games without some sort of direct interaction, we're kind of doubting we'll like this one.

I tried out the card game (and was unimpressed, mainly by the excessive reading and familiarizing with vastly different card abilities that is required, and more importantly at the unbalancedness of the decks (as proven by the AI program test results)), and read a lot about the board game, and didn't have many expectations. Boy, were the boardgame reviews and comments I read misleading! This is a completely different game than the card game - it's actually BALANCED! There are a limited number of abilities to learn (easily digestable in one focused play), and it's not basically a game of War! But it keeps the only strengths of the cardgame - the theme, characters, and art. Very pleasant surprise.

RATING: 9
Wow.  What a great game!

We've now played this one a couple of game nights in a row, and each game gets better.  Next time out we are going to put in the expansion tiles.

I think the best thing about this game so far is that it is SO well balanced.  Every game has come down to the last play with multiple players on the cusp of winning, and there was only one game so far that had anyone trailing by a significant amount.

There is a lot of cooperation, yet a lot of competition at the same time.  The options and tradeoffs are interesting (and critical) on every turn, but even our group's most paralysis-prone players seem to be able to make decisions quickly.

What a game.  The only reasons it's not a 10 yet is that I have not played it enough, but this one may pass Samurai into my #1 slot soon...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The major flaw in this game is that after the first couple of turns when you spend your cards, all of your options are strictly controlled by what cards you happened to draw the previous turn, resulting in all strategies being frustrated or allowed by luck alone.  Result of the one four-player game I played: the winner built 4 cubes, to 1-1-0.  I think I would raise the rating by two or three points if every player started with a full deck of cards and could spend up to 6 of them per turn in any order they chose, with no replacements, thus eliminating the collosal impact that luck has on the game.  But the game doesn't include that many cards.  Bah, as the game stands.

Knizia for everyone. Very, very easy to jump right into this one. You know what your target is, the trouble being you have to wait for everyone else to finish their turn first. I find myself impatient with lighter euros where the decision making is low - you just want your turn! 

Having said that, it is fun with Knizia multiple-scoring mechanics to the fore. The BM world works far better here than the card game, which was rather silly. I like how players are rewarded for jumping on board a number of buildings rather than monopolising.  

Only down side is I've perhaps played it enough now.

Good map movement and building to get stuff from places (high score in each spot gains more). Use cards of matching colors (which can also be used for their powers), also move dragons to get dragon scales. Get the crystals to pay to add your cubes to the monument. First to get four built.

One solo play.  I would like to get this played.  I think it seems like an elegant, fun game from the Doctor.

Plays quickly, but gives a satisfying feel, as the game develops through a few phases marked by charges to the centre to build the obelisk and purging of dragon scales.  The special powers probably make it inaccessible as a family game, but otherwise it is a fine light game.  There is luck, but there is also opportunity for skill, not just in the tactics, but in playing the psychology and 'guiding' the moves of the other players using dragons.  Not world-beating but a game that is fun and challenging without being a brain strain.

Players must weigh an abundance of options: whether to use cards as abilities or as contributions and also when, where, and how much to contribute.

The game also requires a bit of cooperation. Helping construct a building helps you, but it also helps other players constructing the same building and neighboring buildings.

A pretty abstract game of set collection and hand management. The Blue Moon theme is incidental and the game is unrelated to the card game. I like how the city develops, how players can work together to mutual benefits, and how card combinations can create surprising results.  If you are not into abstracts, you may not like the game.

I don't know anything about the Blue Moon world. In this game, players manage their hand of cards in order to complete buildings. Scoring each building gives reward to each player who contributed and gives better reward to the "master builder". Each completed building gives a bonus to orthogonally adjacent buildings, when they are scored. Each suit of cards has also a special power (moving dragon, better speed for your pawn...). The most important reward for scoring buildings are crystals. You can spend crystals to make offers to the obelisk. The game ends as soon as one player has make a certain number of offers to the obelisk, depending on the number of players (2 players: 6 offers, 3 players: 5 offers, 4 players: 4 offers). That player is the winner.

A very balanced race to the end.  Difficult decisions each turn as to gain crystals yourself might help another more.

It plays quickly (90 minutes for beginners) with lots of decisions.

I like Blue Moon a lot, but have gotten tired of it after close to 100 plays.  I loved the feel of this game.  I think that it stays with the theme of the different races really well.  I really enjoyed manuevering to build sections of the city that would benefit me most.  2 things after a first play that struck me as odd:  1. It would have been nice to be able to hamper an opponent.  2. The Pillar 1 and 2 cards seemed a bit too powerful.

Nothing much to do with the card game (which I like, too) except the *splendid* graphics. Can be played with a lighter approach (with kids f.e.) and more in a cutthroat fashion with your *dear* friends. Tactics may change radically depending on number of players. Special abilities of the races seem not quite balanced, but then, you can always discard up to two cards without losing a turn. Rules seem more complicated than the actual game. A true Knizia, well done! (...and obviously the last true "big box game" of Reiner released by a german publisher for quite some time now...)

Update: rating went up - incredible game (although I lose more often than I like)

RATING: 9
Unusual game with some new neat ideas that plays nicely.  The use of cards (special powers) is fantastic.  
However, I find there are some issues: For me, the game is to simple and straightforward, another layer or aspect would have suited the game well (e.g. as is, crystals and the scales are nearly identical except near game end). And the clear impression (after now 10+ games) is that there are kingmaker problems:  In all games, the end was essentially avoiding to give someone else enough crystals to win.

RATING: 7
A fast, tactical game. Luck of the draw is balanced somewhat by dual-purpose cards and ample opportunities to cycle your hand. Where you build and in what order you build is really important to doing well. Most games I've played have been pretty close. The end of the game definitely feels like a race.
Works great with 2, haven't tried it with more.

This game is ok.  It's has the problem of non-intuitive cards that makes it hard to explain to the casual gamer -- yet they're the ones who tend to enjoy the game more than my more serious strategist types.

That makes this game hard to categorize and rate.

Hmmm... don't know what to think about the new Knizia. Where in other Knizia games the best player has a big advantage over new gamers, this one is almost too friendly. And right now, I think it's just no challenge.

Update: The more you play and the more experienced the opponents are, the more cut-throat everything becomes. You indeed have an advantage over new players, when you learned all the little details. Excellent as a two player game.

Still not an 8 or 9 though, because I still often don't see what I have done significantly better than other players when I win.

It's an 8 now, I always win and so I will never turn down a game. ;-)

While I'm no fan of the theme the game system itself is a nice simple resource collection one of using your cards to most effectively acquire crystals at a faster rate than the opposition. Nothing too special, but it's a solid system that moves along at a good clip and isn't boring.

12.24.16  - (1 play, 2p)  I have mixed feelings on the components. The tile artwork is great and I like the wooden pieces.  I don't care for the plastic dragons or the artwork on the cards. The setting is meaningless and uninteresting to me.  Gameplay was fun  and I hope to get my gaming group interested in it. It's hard to go wrong with Knizia.

12.24.17 - (20 plays, 2-4p) Twenty plays in the first year... not something I typically get to do with games, but I’ve really enjoyed this one. I paid 16 or so dollars for those 2 expansion tiles, but they add so much to the game that I think it was worth it.

Don't compare this game to Blue Moon, they have almost nothing in common. The board is assembled mostly randomly with areas that provide a number of dragon scales, cards, and/or crystals as rewards. Areas contain 1-4 boxes, each box contains a colored number, and a player must play cards in the right color adding up to that number in order to play a control cube there. Once all boxes are filled, the land is conquered, everyone gets a reward, and the majority holder gets a bonus. If the area is next to any adjacent areas that have previously been conquered, they also confer a payment. You have to move to an area to play cards there, and there's a range limit, so between that and adjacent bonuses, there's a significant positional element. Scales are essentially traded off for crystals. Crystals are used to purchase real estate on the "oblisk" in the center of the board. Buy four spots on the oblisk to win the game. I liked it. The three dragons are back from Blue Moon, but they're not used for scoring. Rather they provide a scale bonus if you manage to summon them to an area just before you conquer it. Several factors to consider, but nothing too heavy on the brain.

Maybe our favorite Reiner Knizia game at this point. It plays fast and keeps the player engaged with simple gameplay but interesting decisions that lead to a fun and satisfying conclusion. A little bit of luck dependent on the card draw but most of the time you should have enough in your hand to be able to do something to help you progress forward.

I have only played this game with two players and I think it works really well that way.  There is healthy competition with no direct conflict.  After multiple plays though, I agree with the criticism that this game always feels the same.  It is always a tie and a race to who can get back to make the last contribution first.  In the end, I would rather play something else so we traded it.

Addictive.

Neighborhood bonuses are perhaps the most interesting element, as the order in which they are revealed can entirely change the relative value of surrounding tiles.  This can be great when the revealed bonus is highly valuable and you have a presence on the surrounding tiles.  But if you don't have such a presence, swooping in and revealing a low value bonus [b]before[/b] a neighboring high value bonus is revealed can prevent your opponents from cleaning up.

This game is joining my favorites.  I find that I always enjoy it.  Some games warrant great ratings based on various attributes, but the actual [i]play[/i] may feel like work to me.  Not so with Blue Moon City.  Based on attributes such as its variable board, production quality, ease of play, and such, I think Blue Moon City does warrant relatively high ratings, but my own experience of the game goes beyond objective analysis -- I just find it really fun.  Hence, I've continued to revise my rating a bit higher after every play.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

If I have to name a deciding feature, it's the neighborhood bonuses, which remain once a tile is completed and flipped.  But of course the factor really responsible for our decision to give this game space in our crowded house is that we have fun playing it.

RATING: 3.5
Fascinating. After 3 years not playing, I tried again and my rank of 6 was on target. Actually it doesn't seems as tense as other Knizia games as the deck tends to play you and sometimes there's not a lot of options avaliable for you. At it's best it's a decent racing game of leeching off other players - so interaction is always there. At worse it's a cute looking time passer. Theme doesn't really work, unless you play it solo during the night (don't ask...). 

As set collecting goes - compared to TTR this one is far more tactical and could be tense, but TTR is way way more thematic. Oh and levels above the Blue Moon game which is just War in a fantasy drag.

I played this once a few weeks ago and while I enjoyed it, the outcome can be heavily dependent upon luck of the draw.  My guess is that if I play it more, I'll begin to understand some of the deeper strategies and card combos, so I can't really use the luck factor as a downside.  I definitely want to give this another play or two and perhaps revise my rating after.

Should have won the SdJ 2006. This is Kniza at his middleweight best. The Blue Moon wars are over and players use a hand of cards to contribute towards the rebuilding of the city. These cards have other special abilities (wild, change the suit of another card, attracts a dragon, etc). Each turn, a player moves his piece and plays cards to build. There are crystals given to players for building and for collecting dragon scales. These crystals are used to put a temple stone on the Obelisk. The first player to play a set number of obelisk stones wins!

The tension in this game is agonising. Players contantly trying to jostle for position and timing of their building; often hoping their opponents finish off the buildings to get THEM a bonus. The elements of dragon scale scoring and card combinations are clever and it's very much a race game of sorts. The dragons and great artwork is rehashed from the card game and I wished they had kept the Tarot sized cards. The board placement can get fiddly and messy but these are just little flaws in the scheme of things. Faidutti has rightly compared this to Cleopatra (DoW) as both are building and hand management games. Blue Moon City has a slight edge in terms of offering better meshed mechanics and a shorter, tighter and tenser experience.

Nem véletlenül volt év játéka jelölt. A mindig máshogy felépülő pálya, a gyors és kellemes játékmenet, szépen kivitelezettség a játék pozitív tulajdonságai. Jó hárman is, szerintem akár ketten is működhet. Igazi taktikai játék, ahol nagyon kell figyelni az egyes épületek építése közben a fő cél elérésére, az obeliszken való építésre.
A játékosok Blue Moon City-t építik, amiért különböző jutalmakban részesülnek, főleg kristályban, amelyek a fő obeliszk építéséhez szükségesek. Az egyes épületek építése pedig különböző színű kártyákkal megoldható, amelyeknek két funkciója van. Ezen kívül még színes sárkányok is segíthetik a játékosokat. Sok taktikai lehetőség, élvezetes játékmenet. Egyedül a kártyák húzásából fakadó szerencseszerep lehet zavaró.

Olyan érzése van az embernek játék közben, hogy nem tud benne igazán rosszul játszani, de nem is igazán érzi, hogy mi a legjobb lehetőség. Persze akár ki is számolhatja, de az a játékélmény rovására menne.
8->7

[2011-06-17]
A legutóbbi játék során kiderült, hogy jópár szabállyal sok játék után sem voltunk pontosan tisztában. A pontos szabályok megismerése után teljesen más játékmenettel találkoztunk, ami legtöbbször még közel sem azonos játékerőt képviselő játékosok esetén is döntetlenre vezet. Ez annyira számomra nem zavaró, de mindenképp érdekes, hogy erre nem igazán figyeltek a játék tervezésénél. Valahogy nem érzem hozzám közel álló játéknak, de a pontszám marad.

[2013-01-10]
Hárman szerintem kimondottan nem jó, a királycsinálás esélye miatt és továbbra is azt érzem, hogy nüanszokon múlik a győztes kiléte, ez pedig simán lehet egyetlen építés is. Minél többet játszom vele, annál kevésbé tetszik sajnos.

I think I am not fan of Reiner Knizia, to much randomness and i don' like the dynamic of game.

Also i do not like the graphic sometimes it's just awful.

It has been years since I've been excited about a Knizia boardgame.  I really wanted to like this and lo and behold, I actually do.  There is a wonderful mix between hand management, movement and timing.  I love how you want to get a piece of other players actions so that they can do the work for you.  There is a great sense of "Keeping up with the Joneses" as you clearly want to go out and earn more but you simply must come into the center to earn your victory, the longer you put it off the more of a pain in the ass it is going to be.

It seems that three players would work the best for this as 4 may get too chaotic as too much can happen (along with the time spent) between your turns.  Great forward planning, need for flexibility, and reactionary tactics keep this game lively until the end.  Way to get back into the game Knizia.

After a couple of plays, this reveals itself as a good and light game for 3-4.  I lean more towards the game for three, as with many games where the opportunities dry up as the game progresses, it's better to have only two other players up before your next turn.
---
That being said, the game has started to get a little stale for me.  Unless some great revelation comes to me, it seems that the way to win is to keep traveling and dropping cubes on as diverse of boards as you can, so that you pick up resources when the boards flip, and that you get the residuals of the other boards around.

I initially thought this game didn't have much depth and that the hand you had dictated your decisions but after playing this more I realize that there are a lot of important (but fairly subtle) decisions to make in this that make it really interesting while at the same time the game isn't that difficult to learn or complicated. This is another game that I enjoy more each time I play it.

Игра с несложной механикой, но тактически очень разнообразная. Мне напоминает совмещение шашок и покера. Игрушка понравилась.
В исполнении (локализации) есть недостатки слишком тонкие карты, нет защитного покрытия, не слишком выразителен дизайн обелиска и фишек. ИМХО - 5 баллов игрушке, 4 балла - исполнению, 3 балла - исполнению карт от Смарта.

RATING: 7.8
Beautiful art and cool-looking dragons makes for some nice eye candy with this one.  I think that there are some interesting mooching aspects, where it can be valuable to get only partially in on a building and have your opponents finish it for you.  I'm not a huge fan of race games normally, but this one is pretty fun.  I think it's how the location of the squares on the board can affect your rewards and that there is some tension as all scoring is not created equal.

One of our 2-player favorites. Game play runs smoothly with not too much player interaction which suits my wife. I like the primary & strategic use of cards used for building & action boosters. The modular board adds interest & gives a slightly different game each time. Graphically, it's superb & looks great on the table.

The board consists of a central tile square surrounded by tiles that are placed in a particular configuration (square with projections on each side) but with each tile randomly chosen. Tokens start in the middle. The object is to build 4 stones of the Obelisk ... the first 4 built each cost 7 crystals, then costs escalate all the way up to 12. The first player to build all 4 wins. You get crystals by moving around the board and interacting with the tiles. The tiles each require various combinations of cards (you draw 2+n each turn, where n is a number of cards you discard from your hand, from 0-2) played as sets, to complete 1-3 goals. When all goals on a tile are completed, everyone who contributed gets a reward. In addition, the person completing the majority of goals gets a bonus. The rewards are generally crystals, but can also include additional cards and dragon scales. Cards can be used towards these goals, but also for their special powers (different for each of the 5 races/colors). For example, you can discard cards to call the 3 dragons into play or move them onto your tile. If you complete a goal, each dragon present on your tile rewards you with a dragon scale. When all the dragon scales have been awarded, players earn crystals depending on how many scales they have (most are then returned to stock). The interesting thing about the board is that after all goals of a tile are complete, it is turned upside down. From then on, it adds a bonus reward to all adjacent tiles.

The game was just OK. You move around, gather resources, get to the central tile and try to buy the 4 spots as cheaply as possibly. You have to be efficient, and it's interesting how completing 1 tile's goals might set up the other players who are working on adjacent tiles. I like the tile-flipping mechanism where 1 tile adds to the rewards of several others, but there just didn't seem to be very much [i]game[/i] or [i]fun[/i] here!

Despite this being a game where I have to understand the symbols, I find it reasonably intuitive -- perhaps because there isn't a huge amount going on (not in a bad way).

I think I need to play it a few more times to appreciate the depth and subtlety.    My initial impression is it's a game of efficiency, which I usually enjoy, but it felt kind of flat.  On the other hand, the dragons were not even used, so I have a feeling I will like it better with more experience.  Update:  still feels like there's something missing.

I'm a sucker for hand-management games and this is one of the best.  Decisions are tough and plentiful as you vie for control of buildings while not wasting any moves.  Most turns will offer several ways to play your hand and it can be hard to not play too many cards, leaving yourself short for the next turn.  It's a fairly light game but the many choices each turn keep the tension on all the way through the game.

This game is owned by my 15 year old son, so it will stay with the family for some years.
The card graphics and the components quality are to my liking and add to the game atmosphere.
As usual with nearly all Knizia Games it's a game based around dry mathematics stuff, and I often don't like these.
But I have to admit it is fun to play, and for me it is one of the best Knizia games, because it's always been close to see who will win , everybody is involved all the time and believes up until the end that he or she will be the lucky one...
You can't ask for much more of a game, if it only isn't a Knizia...
So it has to be content with a 7 rating.

I quite enjoyed this game, despite not so much enjoying the original Blue Moon 2-player card game.  I tend to find games that are strictly card-based to be personally uninteresting and I typically need a game with an evolving board situation in order to maintain my interest.  Here, the good doctor has combined the hand management of a card game with the movement and flow of making deliveries.  It's a dynamic, fast, and exciting race (though it would probably be much less so with only 2 players - I'd stick to 3 or 4 for this one).  The physical components are quite nice, though I'm quite bitter that my pawn is terribly boring compared to those cool dragons!  The card art is pretty well done, though kinda weird.  Once you get over the hurdle of learning the powers of all the different card colours, the game is easy to dive into and understand (I gave it a "game weight" rating of 2, though in my head I was thinking it was closer to 2.35, and was quite amused to discover that BGG currently has given it an average game weight rating of 2.3 - also, this is a nearly identical comment to one I left in my "Wurfel Bohnanza" game comments).  All in all, I'd be happy to play this one again (but not with just 2).  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

Blue Moon City is not as complicated as the rules at first seem to promise, since most of the details are about the special powers of the different cards, and it takes no more than half a game to get used to that handful of special powers.  Pleasant to play and works up to a nice race to the finish.  Fun hand management game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really enjoy playing this game for a variety of reasons.  Visually the game is very appealing with beautiful artwork that evokes a distinctive "feeling" that just seems to fit well with the theme (as does the artwork in Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper if that helps explain what I mean).  The rules are simple to understand without sacrificing game play, and the gameplay itself is rather elegant.  I particularly like that you don't have to finish construction of a building yourself to gain rewards.  In fact, clever initial contributions coupled with patience while letting others complete buildings can reward you handsomely.  I also like that completed buildings continue to influence rewards for completion of adjacent buildings.  In addition, the play time seems just about right at 1 hour (once you are completely familiar with the rules and cards).  The only one gripe I have about the game is that a few bad card draws in the end-game can make or break you.  This is a minor gripe, but it can be irritating if you have carefully put yourself in a position to win, only to be shut down by your inability to draw cards of a certain color (or even white cards).  Oh well, there's always next game.

[1 play] Initial Reaction rating.  I really enjoyed getting to try this game.  Understanding what all the special things on the cards do took a few rounds.  Really that is my one nitpick about this game is that a lot of card have some special rules and weren't immediately obvious to me by looking at them.  However, the gameplay itself is a good quick pace, the strategy was easy to catch on to.  It was just a really fun game to play.  I would love to play this game a few more times and get into the strategy a little more.  It even has a chance to be a game I could potentially play over lunch against my co-workers.

RATING: 7.5
Good blend of hand management and movement with beautiful components. I'm a bit concerned with the "kingmaking" potential. Players need to be very careful of what they reward their opponents on builds. But overall, a very solid game.

Should only be played with 3 players.

RATING: 9
For some reason, I wasn't particularly impressed with BMC the first time I played it, but after a second try I found it to be an enjoyable and short game.  It's sort of hard to categorize--I guess it would be building and resource management?--but it has pretty art (re-used from Blue Moon), good mechanics, and is easy to teach and understand.

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: I have a bit of trouble with this game, particularly with figuring out whether my cards match a particular tile's color.  I've been told that after awhile you will get used to knowing which races are which colors and that will help.  But, still, a little warning here on that note.

I liked this much better than the card game.  Like most Kinzia's there's a lot of good balance and clever, yet simple, card play.  For a Knizia, it's surprisingly strong on theme (which is to say, not very).  There are a lot of elements we've seen before in other games but this brings them together in some interesting ways.

RATING: 8
Attractively produced tactical card game. What's the best thing I can do with the cards in my hand? Interesting choices as to when & where to build, and whether to work together or strive to lock other players out. Dragon scales add a rather valuable scoring twist. Works well with 2, 3 or 4 players.

Fast moving game of managing a hand of cards to build various buildings. You'll need to share buildings with other players, with the majority player getting an advantage.

Overall a light but fun game.

Played 5+ times.  Very fun.  Plenty of choices with the cards in your hand.  Do you build lots early or do you try to leave all your cubes on the board so that you get more bonuses.  Do you build the majority or just hop on for the left overs.  Do you race for the cheap spots on the obelisk or build up for the killer multiple build.  There is definitely some luck in the card draw, but the number of wild cards and the discard mechanic and the number of building options allow you to mitigate the damage mostly.  Feels mostly tactical.  A fun romp in the blue moon world.  Recommended. 2006/08/23

update : I get a little annoyed at the super balance.

update : With players on an even skill level the balance is wonderfully tense.

A pretty little game, fun for 30 minutes. I'm never in a rush to play it, but I always tend to enjoy it.

Tends to be quite a close finish too...

Those dragon scales are more valuable than you realise.

Update: I wonder what the original theme was here, but there's a strong aspect of leeching/working with others and (for the most part for me) finishing their work to either get a small reward for little work or a lot of reward (by doing the 'most' in a location) for a decent amount of work. The game can leave you behind if you end up at the other side of the board from people and if they're not working with you (and stealing the dragons) but this is a nice, slightly vicious, fast game.

Rating up from 7 to 7.6.

Blue Moon City retains the understated elegance of its 2 player card game sibling. A seemingly simple mechanic makes the game incredibly easy to play, yet there is plenty to think about.

This one is pretty alright, and I'll play it if asked, or if people want to.

I enjoy it enough, and it's fast, but it just doesn't do a lot for me.  The game is pretty much geared to insure that if everyone plays competently, it's just going to be a race at the end to who can get to the center to build the last piece of the temple.  

Maybe there are other ways to handle it, but after a few plays, I don't get enough fun out of the game to want to invest any time into finding out if that is the case.

Blue Moon City is my favorite of the lighter-depth games.  I find the mix of cooperation and competition to be the most intriguing aspect of Blue Moon City.

My wife and I play quite often, and the game holds up quite well when there are only two players.

After single play, I like this very much.  However, as with most games I play, I need some more plays to really get the feel for HOW to play well.  Seems like more players (I played a 2er) would change the gameplay significantly, and likely for the better.

Good fun light game. Starnge in that at first I thought there was a fair amount of strategy, then as I started playing thought it was all actually a bit lucky, but then as I started to get my ass kicked realised that there actually is. Medium weight, not to long, and good fun game.

RATING: 7
I'd say this game has surprising depth, but since it's designed by Reiner Knizia I shouldn't be surprised. Several Knizia signature mechanics interwoven here, perhaps most prominently the aspect of scoring tiles that give players incentives to swarm like sharks when things start to heat up in a particular area. Refusal to glom onto the active spot and contribute to the chain-reaction scoring even while helping others spells trouble for the stubborn holdout. Timing is key here, and while the game looks pretty simple there are numerous things to keep track of, including board position, status of scoring areas, increasing cost of building the obelisk, which cards to possibly discard and, of course, the best use of cards in hand. This, especially, presents tough choices because, while the special powers give your hand of cards some flexibility, it usually comes at the cost of a somewhat inefficient use of resources. Rating unlikely to go down but very well may increase with additional plays.

Very popular game with my game night crowd. People's eyes glaze when they try to understand the powers of the various cards, but come up to speed pretty quickly after 1 or 2 rounds. Strong play is definitely rewarded, so the luck of the draw is not the only factor in determining the outcome of the game. Plays equally well with 2, 3 or 4 players. I wish it supported 5 players.

Blue Moon City is a card set collection game in the classic Knizia style.  Card sets are used to win tiles on a grid.  Each tile is valued by 2 rewards, up to 4 prices, and the benefits of the 4 neighboring tiles.  It's a lot to watch, especially for something with almost no direct conflict.  Ultimately, this is just a race game and the experience is a bit dry.

A cubes -> VP game with a ridiculous pasted-on theme.  Pedestrian and forgettable.

UPDATE: I played it again after a 7 year hiatus.  It's better than I remembered it, probably because my tastes have changed over time.  I enjoy making the best of the cards I draw and trying to put myself in optimal positions to benefit on other players' turns.  I also like that it has a bit of a race/scramble feel to it.

Cool system.  The theme is still stupid, though.

We had a great time playing as a couple and really look forward to playing again. When my wife says that she has a hankering to play again, you know it's a winner. Plays lightly, but with some good choices to make. After one play, I can safely say that it's at least 8.5 in my book.

Not Knizia's deepest game- but fun nonetheless. It seems very well balanced, to the point that usually everybody is on the verge of winning when it ends. Knowing what cards to discard at the end of your turn is probably the key to victory, along with making sure you have a presence in key cities. Scales very well 2-4.

Disappointing first reaction. This game is like Rocketville, but with even less theme and personality.

Solid, simple mechanics, good game-play, but like some other Knizias, lacking a certain 'fun' factor.  I seem to be uncannily good at this game, which confuses me a little, as it is not one those games that consumes my waking moments with strategy thoughts (and believe me, there are some that do).

Very clever system, with cards having two possible functions -- a building contribution and a special power.  Play time is just right.  I am concerned about a slight advantage accruing to the starting player -- unusual for Knizia as his games are usually so well balanced.  I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but it remains a nagging concern.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun, interactive, captivating game that plays under an hour.  Random setups, plus card distribution will allow for a different experience every time.  Sign me up for the next game please.  The dual actions of the cards, allows the players to play the cards, instead of the cards playing the player.  The more I think about it, the more I like it.  

With four players the game can get hairy.  It can turn into two teams of two.  Worse yet, if there is one team of two and two people trying to jump in, and get jumped in on.  They have no chance.  A problem with the players more than the game... but it IS a lighter game.

It has that "Oooh thats nifty factor"... but it wears off and leaves an average game.  The winner never feels to me like the player played the best game.  Only four plays, but I would rather leave it at only four.

RATING: 6
Meh... this Knizia game didn't grab me in the same way that Tigris & Euphrates, Through the Desert, Ra, Taj Mahal, and Amun-Re all did.  It's a relatively interesting hand management game, but not particularly engaging (at least for someone unfamiliar with the Blue Moon theme).  I do like how all of the cards are balanced by the 1's having a better ability, the 2's having some ability, and the 3's having no ability.  The ability to cycle cards is nice, and the possibility for interesting card combinations is there, but most turns are still pretty straightforward.  The game does scale pretty well from 2 to 4 players, although it's a bit too chaotic with more people.

Quite fun, though I'm nearing 10 plays and still not sure how much of a factor luck of the draw is.  Also the game is pretty tight...it can feel like you were just a turn away from winning every time (though really I suspect had you played a little better you might have won).

[thing=21882][/thing] mixes the usual numbers + colors thing that Knizia like so much, with some racing (for the tower) and area influence (for the tiles).

Overall it works pretty well, keeping everyone involved. There is a luck factor in the drawing of the cards, but more often than not, smart play will overcame this easily.

The bits are standard to good, and the art (on the cards and tiles) is great.

BMC offers so many variations through card play, random layout and the neighbourhood bonus that you always have different decisions to make and never need to play the same way twice.

[UPDATE] Having played this a few more times, I'm finding that the variety that I thought was there is a false positive.  The game is always close almost regardless of the strategy taken by the players.  This sounds like a good thing but in fact it makes the game repetitive and more luck comes into play than is there at first appearance.

Put up on Oz Chain of Generosity after receiving San Juan and Kahuna.

The cards' pairing of values and abilities is well done, and there's good challenge in trying to get your opponent to want to complete a tile that you've started and will give you good benefits. The game is fun and pretty accessible, but it does suffer from one classic Euro problem: it's overbalanced to the point that it often seems it doesn't really matter what you do, all players will be really close.

I'm impressed by this game's popularity among people I try it with. Almost everyone was a fan after the first play. I think it might be because it allows niceness and cooperation into a competitive game, coupled with a good demonstration of progress (completing buildings, getting resources, all that jazz).

Blue Moon City - the board game - picks up where the two-player game, (Blue Moon), ended: the reconstruction of the destroyed city of Blue Moon. The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other. As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons.

At the start of the game, the board tiles all show their building plan sides. The object of the game is to use cards featuring the races of Blue Moon to help rebuild the city and, at the end, put the large Crystal of the Obelisk in the middle of the city back together. Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side. The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.

The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game. (four markers in a 4-player game, five markers in a 3-player game, and six markers in a 2-player game)

There are two mini-expansions for this game (Blue Moon City: Expansion Tile Sets 1 & 2), each consisting of two tiles that can be added to the main game either separately or combined. The first mini-expansion was included with the Der Knizia Almanach. The second mini-expansion was included in the 6/06 issue of Spielbox.

Original Knizia design--after dragon scales score, ALL players discard scales. This rule was modified by the publisher.

Only played two two-player games sofar, and expect that rating will go up after a game with three players (the sweet spot according to most BGG reviewers).
Tight game with clearly written rules and a clear objective. The luck of the draw definitely plays a big role in this game, but it nevertheless rewards good tactical play. It also encourages you to think ahead, and move your pawn towards your intended target in time. Also, I love the way it looks!

RATING: 7
Played for the first time in 2013, this game has aged ever so slightly. This is reminiscent of a Knizia at the height of his creativity. Many aspects of the game are well balanced, but the ideas are not fresh. The semi-cooperative nature of the game probably felt new in 2006, but not these days where coop games are a dime a dozen. Players need to take advantage and cooperate to rebuild the city structures. Going it alone is fine, but not nearly as efficient as sharing the burden (and rewards) of reconstructions. Luck of the draw in cards and sometimes prevent players from making the desired play, but clever hand management (using the jokers or "hoax" color-switch cards) can overcome that impediment. There are several signature Knizia mechanisms buried within the game. For example, limited cube supply per player(ten) is clever way to slowdown the leaders since cubes placed on the monument to win the game will essentially be out of the game as well. Clever design, just feels a little old.

Sept 2015: Design does feel old but nonetheless still an excellent game. Game play has a semi-coop feel to it though players who strayed away from the group play and set out on their own maybe be left out. It appears with 4 players, staying together in a bunch formation to capitalize on completing the tiles together is the way to go. Otherwise, an excellent design.

Recently lowered because I'm getting a bit tired of lighter games.  A competent design, but I'd probably pass up a game if offered right now.

Yes, I have the same comment on Ra and Ingenious.  But this game is what first made me realize that Reiner's light stuff has a shorter shelf life than I think we give it credit for.  So it's the lowest of the three.  It tries to make you believe it's a substantial game with its big box and fancy artwork, but it's really not.

The card combos are fine, but, for reasons I don't understand, I don't enjoy the experience. My inclination is to say that the game is too random to have fun with the card combos, but that is not correct as I enjoy other games with a similar mix.

Played:  Once.  Yet another Knizia game with a pasted on theme.  That withstanding, this game is not very exciting.  Furthermore, it is heavily luck driven.  Draw cards, look at the board, go to where you can use the cards you got.  Boring.  There is one viable strategy, and that is to get in as many cities as you can.  Boring.  I'm getting the feeling that people play this game cause its designed by Knizia.

This one's easy to explain: you're some sort of pointy hat dude represented by a neat token that wanders around the fantasy-themed Blue Moon City making contributions to dragons in order to build its buildings and collect crystals to then offer those to an Obelisk (not the cartoon character). Ok? This is essentially a hand-management card game. Random starting tile placement adds some replay value. Has a "Gateway" difficulty level. An absolutely gorgeous game in terms of art and components. Plays well enough but the theme doesn't really come through for me, making the game mostly feel like its mechanisms, and seriously diminishing the experience in my view. Traded for Thurn & Taxis at Montreal Mathtrade February 2009.

Al and I each had five offerings on the Washington Monument. Whoever could get 12 crystals and get to the center first would win. Al had 11 crystals and was four spaces (two turns) from the center and two spaces (one turn) from my position. I had 12 crystals and was two spaces (one turn) from the center. It was Al's turn. He turned to me and said, "Clearly, you are 'going up' next turn. I have no choice. I must now land on you, kill you, and take a crystal. Where are the dice?"

For some inexplicable reason, Blue Moon City triggers a Talisman sense memory. Maybe it is that it is a race game where we run around, picking cards and hope for the best, and accumulate dragon scales, like dead enemies, for points.

When Knizia's on, he's ON.  This game has great agonizing decisions, and a lot of really neat optimization.  You constantly have to decide whether to play your cards for their numerical strength, or for their special ability.  Based on the situation, the utility of the cards in your hand can go up or down.  It's tempting to go for just a few more crystals, but you're going to be in rough shape if somebody else makes their donations before you.  I have some concerns after a healthy number of plays that there is a pretty strong first-player bias, and that luck and player chaos can play a very strong role, but for a game like this that is so bite-sized, I'm willing to forgive a lot.

I did enjoy the game very much, played it with 2 only, so there wasn't a lot of fighting for majorities and so forth. We tended to just go to a card, and build as many sections needed to guarantee the majority. Lots of interesting decisions in how you use the cards, I like games where the cards give you special powers.

Although it's been years since I played it, I remember Blue Moon City being one of FFG's better stabs at a Euro-style game.  It has some really cool choices with the way players activate the location tiles.  I definitely enjoy Blue Moon City over the card game that inspired it.

UPDATE: Increased rating from 8.5 to 9. May rise to 10 in time. A beautiful-looking, evergreen game with tactical depth. It improves with repeat plays.

Players move around Blue Moon City, contributing to buildings by playing groups of coloured cards. Finishing buildings gives you crystals. You can also gain crystals by collecting dragon scales, which you get by attracting dragons when you contribute to buildings.

The many special cards make this too complex for a non-gamer, but there really isn't much of interest for a gamer. Blue Moon City falls squarely into that genre I'm not a fan of- the mid-weight game that plays itself. It seems player scores will always be close, since everyone gets the same constant stream of income and no infrastructure investments are possible. It's predominantly tactical, hoping that the cards you draw align with the best opportunities on the board. Overall a vanilla game I have little desire to play again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Solid area majority game. The game seems very light but as you play, it becomes more of a brain burner then expected. Still light enough for newer gamers to enjoy. Luck is certainly involved with the card draw. Quite a bit of strategy with controlling areas at certain times and summoning of dragons. I enjoy this game.

RATING: 8
Rating this an 8 after the first play. Very enjoyable and lots of room for strategy to develop on subsequent plays.  Seems very well balanced for 2 players, as noted here on BGG extensively (which is why we bought it).  The lead changed hands a lot and it was a see-saw battle down to the last play.  Can't wait to play it again.  Only complaint really is that the red cards should move the red dragon (they move the green dragon instead), the green cards should move the green dragon (they are wilds instead), and the black cards should be wild (they move the red dragon instead).  This can be confusing, since the blue cards DO move the blue dragon as expected, but it's easily overcome when playing.

Really enjoying so far, does not play that well with 2 players.  3 or 4 is where the action is at.  The cards give you many options and ways of doing what you want to do.  You also need to anticipate  what the other players are doing cause if you're too greedy they won't help you at all.  Set up buildings that will give you bonuses when completed.  This game just really works well and has lots of nice choices to make.

Not a bad game, but I thought I'd like it more than I did. It reminded me a lot of Kingdoms - not mechanically, but in terms of what you're trying to accomplish (that is, setting yourself up for a good combo without it being so good that your opponents won't take it from you before your next turn). The difference (besides that this is a much more subtle game of small advantages, which I don't want to downplay) is that, in Kingdoms, you know everything that's out there, and that just about everything will come into play during any given round. In Blue Moon City, the randomness of the cards (and size of the deck) means you have no idea whether or not anyone can do anything on their turn, unless you're an excellent card counter. This makes long term strategy fairly difficult, which in turn minimizes the main tension in the game for me (using the cards for their powers or holding on for their values). I should note I've only played this with 2, but I don't know if more players would add more balance or chaos. Ditto with including the expansion tiles.

RATING: 7
A nice little game there from Mr. Knizia with some elegant mechanisms built in. This game is all about helping to rebuild a destroyed city and then winning the favour of the Gods by making appropriate sacrifices. Proper hand management and astute placement of "architects" are a must if you're to outsmart your fellow players. Fairly easy to grasp, recommended as a family/entry level game.

Another overwrought FFG product (though Kosmos bears at least as much blame).  Could [i]easily[/i] fit into the thicker Silver Line box (Through the Desert), or one even smaller than that.

Gameplay is pretty simple, but strategies and tactics seem difficult, at least at first. But further play shows it's on rails, with finishes artificially close.

Seems  very easy to fall into a "group vs. one" pattern, where trying to (or being forced to) go it alone will fail badly.  Reminded me strongly of Tower of Babel in terms of directing points to opponents in order to advance your own cause, and yet I didn't like it as much as ToB as I felt more at their mercy than able to chart my own course.

After a bunch of plays,  it's still a good game that tends to keep everyone in the game all the way to the end, although the actual ending tends to be anticlimactic, if you spot the leader and there's nothing to do to change the outcome before it gets back to him.

Very nice medium weight hand-management game. What makes the game interesting is that most of the cards are dual-purpose, and so players can use them to build or turn them in for some other advantage (increased movement, movement of dragons, et cetera). One caveat: I have the impression that the game is so balanced that everyone is always ready to cash in their last stash at the same time (which reminds me of Mesopotamia). A pity this game didn't win Spiele des Jahres 2006 (but that's just my opinion).

rating after 6 plays. Sounds complicated when reading the (quite) long rules and the many different special effects of the cards, but is easy to tell. Interesting mechanisms. Down point was that the winner was decided with a few (random) cards when several players had enough 'money'.

Blue Moon City looks great, and has a satisfying, if slightly tacked on, theme; racing to rebuild the city really appeals. I suspect Blue Moon City might have been produced to capitalize on the artwork created for Blue Moon, but all the same it has a lot going for it.

This just might be my favorite game and I don't really know why. I just love it! I'm still only learning Blue Moon so I'm happy to find a version (this board game) that is not as complex but has the same theme, which I find fascinating and cool. I guess I like the element of collection in this, but that you can still get ahead even if you do not have the biggest or best collection. If I had to pick, I would probably say that element attracts me most to this game but who knows, really, why this speaks to me so? I just adore it, lots of fun and easy but in a stimulating way, not in a simplistic way. Love love love!

One of those Knizia games that's hard to come by. Certainly not one of his very best, but still enjoyable and easy to teach to new players. You're trying to hop from tile to tile, reconstructing a city, which earns you crystals and dragon scales. What more do you need to know to want to try it?

This game is one of our favorites.  The game scales incredibly well from 2-4, with the majority of our games being 2-player affairs.  

The need to pre-plan what you're going to do with your building tokens and not spread yourself too thin is really one of the funnest things about the game, as is the race for those desireable dragon scales.

RATING: 7
purchased 04.07.07 played 2 times previously. Yet another Knizia that I have grown to love *much* more with repeated plays. What we have is a light-medium weight game which plays quickly, is fun to play with gamers and family. After 6 plays, I'm still sticking to an 8 rating. There are subtleties to when a player should work together or go it alone. There is also the other element where one races for the most dragon scales, si far I have only seen the scoring of the scales a couple of times in a game. Is it possible to go for really trying to drag as many dragons as you can at each contribution phase to cycle through the scales as often as possible? I dunno, but another strategy worth considering. So far it always seems a good thing to ride the backs of other players rather than going it alone. Interesting game.

I really enjoy this game. It is easy to get people interested in modern board-gaming via this game. I do find that the end scores are generally quite close. I find the original rules for the scales (if you do not have at least three you lose them on collection) play a little better. This has gotten a large number of plays. It has held up well. A few weaknesses but feels like a solid 8.

Recently this has seen a bunch of plays as both my 10 yr old twins have been into it.

This has fallen to 7.5 due to a combination of overplay and some of the newer worker placement games that give a bit more flexibility. This is still a very solid light strategy game. I consider it a classic.

Have not gotten this out in a long time. My girls (15) wanted to play again and we all thought it was still great.

Great components, great strategy, nice use of the Blue Moon setting and established art/motif. I liked the number and type of decisions, and the fact that coming in second could be almost as beneficial as coming in first -- the rewards for participating in the scoring was tempting enough to warrant a lot of careful decision making, especially at the risk of letting someone resolve a region by himself and take all the credit solo. In that regard, it reminded me a bit of Marracash, where if it's gotta' score anyway, you at least want a piece of the action. Pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

Mechanically unconnected to the semi-ccg.  Beautiful components.

My rating has dropped over time as I gradually came to realize that virtually every game ends with every player on the verge of victory.  You have to screw up royally to be out of contention at game end.  Makes winning feel more random.

But it's still pretty, and fairly unique.  Great cards.

Really abstract, dull mechanics, looks pretty.

I'd hoped it would serve as a gateway game due to the nice artwork and what I assumed would be simple gameplay. However because of the bizzare objectives which require you to impress dragons to give you their scales to turn into magic crystals to give to an obelisk. I just had no idea on each turn what would be anything close to an optimal move, I just kinda flapped around doing nonsensical tasks until the game was over.

How anyone can manage to make such simple mechanics so utterly confusing is beyond me. Total nonsense.

Pierwsze siedem partii grane z niewłaściwą zasadą; wydawało nam się, że każdy gracz może ofiarować tylko jedną kostkę na poziom. Okazało się, ze wypełniać kostkami można też oba miejsca w monumencie. Dlatego ocena zwiększyła się z 5 do 6. Gra nie za ciężka, w sam raz na partyjkę z żoną, bądź z dziećmi

After 2+ Plays: I really like this one after a couple plays.  Works well with 3/4, haven't tried it with 2 yet, but prob. will soon.  Will prob. buy.

After 5+ Plays: I didn't like it so much with two players.  Helping your only opponent is counterproductive, so you basically finish each tile yourself.  This dissuaded me from buying the game, but I'll still happily play it.

Cool game; could have had great mainstream appeal if the theme weren't so geeky!! Hard to get nongamers to play things with dragons and aliens.

not played

Only played solo to date but I really like it. Very simple game play.

Edit: Played a couple of 2 player games now and I really like it. Its simple and vaguely confrontational and suits well when I'm in the right mood.

I really enjoy this game.  It plays equally well with two as it does with more.

Rating after only one game, I could get an idea of the game but have to play it again to fully understand the mechanics. I liked the different mechanics and the player interaction. Pretty sure my rating will increase with additional plays!Updated to a 7 then an 8 :)

I am still on the fence with this game. It plays great but it seems that a player really needs to have the correct cards about midway through the game in order to win...maybe you can get those cards via proper card management but ist seems to luck-oriented to me.

Only one playing so far, so hard to tell anything definite. Seems okay, but nothing special or 'wow' about this.

RATING: 8
This is one fun game that feels breezy and dynamic. I love the cards and how they work together.

++ Great interaction between the cards in your hand. Itis like solving a mini-puzzle each turn.

+ Beautiful artwork on everything.

-The winner usually wins by only a turn or so, which is too close and feels like turn order might make a difference.

Cool little game. That it's very abstract probably makes me want to play it less, despite the solid system.

4/9/07 - Blue Moon City is a fun game to play regardless of whether or not you win.  I think that, in-and-of-itself is kudos enough for this game.  It is also an amazingly imaginitive sequel to a very dissimilar game (Blue Moon).

RATING: 10
Simple clear mechanics, short downtime and a reasonable amount of strategy.

This game has great appeal to non-gamers and it's got enough depth and decision-making to keep games interested too.

The game has a great theme and lacks the silly names of it's card game cousin.  On top of that the mechanics are simple enough that a casual gamer can pick it up quickly, but complex enough to warrant new strategies every time you play.

Always very close results and not clear how to influence it much.

One of the better solitaire games out there.  The A.I. engine is very good and makes life tough on you.  I really like how the cards read like newspapers, have historical facts at the bottom, and has A.I. instructions that match the theme of the newspaper.

This really connects thematically and oozes with shiny good chrome (be sure to play the advanced game!) and does a great job of capturing the war unpredictably without an opponent, so big thumbs up for the work put in on it.  While there are better strategic-level Civil War games out there ([thing=833][/thing], [thing=701][/thing], [thing=2081][/thing], and [thing=89][/thing]), this is still a fun one that I'm happy to have.

I think I will give up trying to be interested in any Civil War game that isn't GCACW. The arc of the whole campaign just doesn't interest me much for whatever reason. This design feels somewhat hodepodgey as well.

A decent little solitaire game from Victory Point Games. Why does VPG always have to hold back a dozen cards from the base game to be released as an expansion?

Ingenious riff on Darin Leviloff's Israeli Independence game. Includes a surprising quantity of stuff and manages to combine military, political, economic and diplomatic action. The interrelation of the various tracks means there is a puzzle here to be solved yet it generates an excellent narrative

For me my best state of siege. I do agree with the fact that sometimes the system is driving the game BUT I, personally,love the historic feeling of this game: the increasing overwhelming power of the north during the course of the game

[2/22/18] I would like to try the advanced game and the expansion.  Generally it has been fun and educational, though I have to refer to the rules much more often than I would like (e.g. "what can I do with a torpedo again?"), and honestly, playing as the South is a bit of a turn off for me.  For some reason this didn't bother me in Twin Peaks but it does here.

RATING: 7
Solitaire game where the player is defending the Confederate States of America during the US civil war.  Meaty State of Siege (number 5?) game with 8 pages of rules for the basic game, and another six for the advanced game.  Takes the basic Israeli Independence engine and adds a lot of US civil war chrome, such as general swapping, gunboats, forts, ironclads, and assorted other stuff.  The basics are the same, flip a card, advance the Union armies into the South, then try to beat them back.  The decks are now broken into years, so you'll see the Army of the James and Potomac swap positions in '62 for the Peninsula campaign, and so on.  Tough game, and a lot seems to depend on getting Lee to where the action is, and keeping him alive (neither is particularly easy - once he is dismissed you have to randomly draw him to get him back).  So, a bit to learn to get into it, but a rewarding 90 minute solo game once you're there.  The advanced game (grab the merged rulebook - much easier), as well as the expansion kit, adds just a little extra complexity for a much richer game.  This is excellent stuff.

RATING: 8
Provides a very good strategic overview of the ups and then downs of trying to manage and direct the Confederacy as the weight of the Union bears down on you.  You will cheer when you win against the odds and despair as the Union juggernaut moves into the South, accompanied by blockade and political actions.  However, it is possible to save the South!  Recommended!

A miss as far as I'm concerned. I never feel like I have made any real choices in the game, it pretty much tells me what I have to do.  The choices I do have don't seem to match up with the major decisions the South actually had to make. Surprised the ratings here are as good as they are.

RATING: 9
Very ambitious solitaire recreation of the Civil War. The SOS system is stretched very successfully -- clever game mechanics, great historical modelling, chrome oozes out of every pore. It takes about twice as long to play than most SOS games, but the experience is worth it. There are so many dimensions to Lost Cause -- player skill, not luck, dominates the game. 
Which leads me to my only quibbles: There is one crucial piece of luck in the game -- getting Bobby Lee into the game early. You are a heavy favorite to get Lee in time -- which leads to part 2: With Lee in hand, you are almost certain to win, once you've mastered the game (and stopped trying to "save" the South, just "win" the game). 
However, this is a solitaire game, you can play the game as is, till you "crack" it (immensely enjoyable in its own right), then do one rule change to each (Basic, Advanced) version (less gamey, more realistic) and then continue playing this superb game.

RATING: 4
Update -- Another play in, and I think this one missed the boat. Too many decisions that don't matter, with the resources, DRMs, and fiddly rules. Example: Commerce Raider. A whole new section of rules for a single counter that you will use maybe once per game, for what? A +1 DRM! 

I've won two out of three. Which is NOT to say that the game is easy, but that you can fluke in to easy wins without much skill, because there just are not many choices to make that matter in the game. Winning strategy was to get lucky with Lee coming in to the East early, and spending practically every free action to fight with him. Completely ignore the West and Mississippi. Every major space was taken except for Richmond, and I still achieved a Major Victory.

Still, my conclusion holds, that it's a somewhat enjoyable walk through the Civil War. I learned something from it.

---

This has a lot less decisions than my other experience with a States of Siege game, Levee en Masse. In The Lost Cause, most of your actions are prescribed (i.e., a battle action with a particular army) so you decide nothing. Your "free choice" actions are so unlikely and ineffective that they don't matter much. This is definitely frustrating, when your free choice actions have generally a 1/6 or 1/9 chance of happening, and even if successful have very little effect.

It's a very detailed game, some of which works and some of which doesn't. The programmed Union army actions are cool. But so much of the details are encapsulated in too many DRMs that become impossible to remember -- +1 for this leader, -1 for that space still controlled, +1 because it's Tuesday, and so on. Also, there are many special rules for different Confederate resources, when they all do generally the same thing.

Overall, an interesting walk through the Civil War. But as with so many, it needs another pass by a developer with the pruning shears.

RATING: 9
This is one of the heavier titles in the series. Forms a good narrative of the war. Decisions are relatively few so not quite a true nail biter (as I found with Levee en Masse). Rating a 9 for simulation value, as this one chronicles the war better than almost every other game in this crowded field.

One of my favorite states of siege games. These resource management games can make you pull your hair out but gives you a real good feel of being pressed. Generals play a big role in this one so you need to have the right Generals in the right theaters to last.

Really like the other Victory Point games that I have acquired recently and when I saw that there was a solitare ACW game available I though that I just have to have it. Quite expensive but as ever a really nicely produced game. I really like Empires in America and am hoping that this one does something similar!

Ordered from VP Games and it's on it's way. More complex then Zulus on the Ramparts but that's to be expected when dealing with a 4 year war and not just one battle:). Looking forward to this one.

Arrived today! The game looks great. I'll have a re-read through the rules and hopefully set it up soon!

Set up last night and played about half way through the 1861 cards. Lots of flipping through the rules but thats normal for a new game and with only a few pages to look through not too difficult. Halleck is threatening Vicksburg! I need the CSN! (navy) or a better commander than Polk! Might try to post an AAR soon.

Really tough game, have never managed to win after several games so a lost cause indeed! Still addictive though so well worth tracking down. Upped rating to a 9 because I'm preferring it to "For the People"! Also to even things out since a few people can't get their heads around the rules so they blame the game and give it a 5. It's not the game...go play ASL solitaire if you want to feel your brain melting!

RATING: 8
Excellent solitaire design, one of the more complex in VPG's "States of Siege" series. Has a steeper relative learning curve (although it is still a light wargame) and receives some criticism for having too much "chrome". Actually, it has little chrome in the usual sense (ie, special rules added on top of the underlying system simply to impart period flavor). What it DOES have are many moving parts that work seamlessly to create a complex puzzle, one that does a masterful job at not only recreating the ACW but also creating a rich, branching narrative and a high level of replayability.

I really like the concept in this game, but the rules are quite fiddly.....meaning that when I have played it, I need to keep referring back to them for exact modifiers for certain situations.   Somehow this needed to be simplified into a better chart or reference.

Only reason this gets a 6 is because of my interest in the Civil War, otherwise it would be a 5 or less.

 Waiting for this one for a long time. Hope it is so 
funny as Soviet Dawn, but with more complexity.

 This is not as Soviet Dawn. Is different, but is good.
 The feeling when you play is another one, but I like.  

 Received on march 15, 2010

 After my first play I can say that the basic game adds
 a bit more complexity than Soviet Dawn. For example:
 leaders, more resources and naval actions.

 Temporary rating with the Basic Game.

 I´m increasing my rate play after play. This game has 

 been very well designed and developed.

RATING: 5
After a few plays my rating for this has dropped a little.  Soviet Dawn is just so much easier with so many fewer things to remember on each and every roll.  I find myself constantly forgetting an initiative marker because I was calculating some other drm or trying to figure out what else i can do.  I do think that the expansion solves a few issues such as making sure naval and land resources are separate. -- On the whole though, outright survival after Sherman has taken over in the west and Grant has taken over in the east feels a lot less like I have any kind of decision to make than I'm just waiting to see how long and how far the mudslide makes it down the hill before burying the South.  I guess that should be the feeling after the four and a half year contest; but it just doesn't make you want to jump back in and get kicked in the teeth over again...  On a side note, the specific rules are finally starting to become second nature after a half dozen plays.

RATING: 4
What bothers me is you have the same year cards each year, the only variable is the order. If there was a bigger year card pool and a certain number of them (at random) were selected, I feel there would be more variance in the game. The Lost Cause to me felt very scripted have the same events occur in every game. There was going to be a Peninsula Campaign each play, an automatic fort siege by the Army of the Tennessee, and the Emancipation Proclamation was going to happen no matter how the war was going. Maybe it could be held till an army was at a certain location or after a battle loss by the Confederate solitaire player. 
The way Confederate leaders were randomly picked for theater at the start I thought was ok but when they were replaced made no sense. As the introduction said the player was Jeff Davis. Why are they drawn then from a cup when replaced? As Jeff Davis one would know who he would want to put in charge of a theater or military commander. I thought Pemberton would be a minor general, I would have used Kirby Smith (3-0 & 3 MC). All the number of leader casualty checks and replace leaders didn't make any sense to me on the event cards. Why is a player mandated to replace a leader? How often would a theater commander be in the line of fire?
To me the game is too scripted and gamey, with some changes it would be a better game, like more event cards to randomly pick from. On the positive side I liked how the Army of the Tennessee can flip from a land based army to a naval one and it was a quick playing one. There is a fair amount of die rolling for those players who don't like a lot of dice rolling.

Just couldn't wrap my mind around this one. Basic and Advanced versions cause some confusion. Requires more effort than the standard SoS game. I will re-visit it one day as the topic is so compelling.

My favorite States of Siege game. Pushes complexity right to where I want it, and does some really neat things: a chance to respond to enemy's delayed movements, multiple enemy tracks that later converge on your main points. ACW theme is great here.

Starts at 6, but I have to make some plays more and add the Expansion first, then review the rating.

I was eager to add the Expansion right away after my first play, but now I want to play the Advanced game more times before doing it. We'll see.

Another great offering from Victory Point Games. I have had fun with this so far and feel the need to play it a lot more to better understand how the game works. And that my friends denotes a good solo game for me. It is not a push over - will take some time to get a grip on strategy for this title - and I am confident that I will have fun doing it. I do so crave a deeper civil war solo game though but I savor this title for now. The flavor text on the cards and the graphic design do help to transport me back to that time. I am hoping that another deep solo game based on the civil war sees its genesis at Victory Point in the near future.

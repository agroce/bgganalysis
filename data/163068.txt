Wow there is a lot of game here. Layers of game. Similar to Kanban in board movement, strategy, and player interaction. I think I need to play it again before I decide how I feel about it but for now I'll classify it as a community puzzle where people get in each other's way trying to solve it.

Another game played at our GenCan't conference as a 3 player game.  This along with Arkwright took the show for me for games that we played.  The theme is awesome, love the Magician theme.  Would like to play again and see how things play out in game two.  Lots of tricks to learn, but need to figure out what tricks couple well with each other. This is definitely a top 10 game for me. I see it moving up and not out of it.

My very first heavy board game. Seriously I'm still very in love with this game until today although we don't have much chance to play it again due to have too many new games. This game is about magician going to hire staff for magic show, buy ingredient to learn/prepare magic show, schedule for theater time slot, then perform and earn points! The unique mechanism is at the theater part where it's up to how fast you place down the hot spot before others. It's a damn pretty nice worker placement game.

Played basic game. 

Initial thoughts: Rule book is convoluted, not overly clear and  with no index. Too many mechanisms create an illusion of depth but it's not deep or complex just complicated. Not very stream-lined. Looks nice at first glance (has pleasingly muted colours and nice art) but it is difficult to decipher the symbols from the back ground art. Really enjoy the setting and theme but the game left me cold.

RATING: 8
I think that this is one of the few eurogames which entirely captures the and translates into a game the theme: the life of a magician. Set in a steampunk millieu, it's visuals are awesome although the player mats and board I think are a bit overdimensioned. The mechanics are great, capture all the aspect of running a magician school and show. Still, it is a heavy eurogame with easy to learn rules, but a lot of small details which you have to take into account. My feeling was that it could have had more turns than it has (that abrupt ending feeling) but still, it is a good game. Willing to play it, but only with connoiseurs.

1st play: Played in a 2 player matchup. The actions feel thematic and the game fits together well. One of the few Kickstarters that don't really feel like a Kickstarter. Took about 3 hours to learn and play the first time, I'm reasonably confident we could get it down to 1.5-2 for a 2p game with repeat plays. There's a lot to puzzle through and I enjoyed the game.

2nd play: Played 3p this time, and the game was still good. I'm not a huge fan of the Black Alley cards, because when you're on the other side of the table you have to get up to go read them. Also the prophecies are important but vary the rounds up fairly significantly. The high end tricks feel rewarding to complete and the points/money value for them make it worth it. Looking forward to playing again, and I think this game is one that won't fade too quickly with time as the basic actions are straightforward.

By far the heaviest game I own; the mechanisms don't mirror it but it makes me think of Colosseum turned to 11 complexity and I mean that in the best possible way. Wonderful art, theme and components. I do need an organizer though because setup is a bit long without one.

RATING: 7
Definitely some fun mechanisms in Trickerion. I vastly prefer it with the Dark Alley cards and magician powers. Helps add quite a bit to the game, IMO. 

Trickerion is fun, but it also falls into some euro game traps. The market system is awkward and gamey just for the sake of being gamey, it seems. And the main source of points, performances, is very whatever. It works. But it feels so half-baked and under-developed. It seems like the main thrust of the game (performing tricks) should be more interesting and slightly less abstract, somehow.

To perform tricks, we stick some tokens on cards that have a variety spatial arrangements. But the arrangements almost never affect gameplay. The variety almost seems superfluous. You can place a magician to fire off a card with tokens on it, and we get points. The player firing off the card gets some small bonuses for doing it. But the trick bonuses are usually more substantial. 

It feels so vaguely thematic and like there's a lot of steps for minor differences in point bonuses. The degree to which the trick descriptions themselves have been themed really makes me want the performances to feel more interesting as well.

RATING: 7.5
I went into this experience a touch apprehensive, anticipating a complex game. There certainly is a lot to consider, but -- like most euros -- the complexity was mere illusion. Everything clicks together relatively well. 

I detest the character art, but found everything else quite nice.

Original score: 9

Dec 2017 update: Downgraded to a 7.5. Decent enough game, the length and mental exhaustive nature makes it slightly less of a recommendation. Still happy with it, and will never sell. I just might not play it very often.

I feel like I should have liked this game more than I did.  Why?  Because the art is incredible, the theme is everywhere, and the worker placement mechanic and other mechanics appear to be euro-interesting.  

Yet, curiously, the "good art," nevertheless. felt needlessly overdone and cluttered on first play, such that the game board was heard to navigate.  And the theme - preparing magic tricks, in this case, for several hours - is just not my cup of tea.  Simply put, I am not really into preparing magic tricks sufficiently to want to simulate this action, for hours, in a game.  

Finally, the mechanics ended up feeling dull, and very rinse and repeat for my tastes.  Playing with the expansions adds a great many card effects to either want, or worry about if other players have them, but for my tastes, these card effects, while interesting at times, could not remedy my overall disinterest in the core of the game.

I'm enamored with the game so far, having only played without the dark alley.  However it does so many little things differently enough that it feels truly compelling.  The theme is fine, but actually playing the game within it works really well.  It's a fun, animated little system you go through, researching, building, preparing and performing new tricks, and the headbutting with other players really makes it shine.  There's interaction without much opportunity for bullying, and a good bit of figuring out your priorities round to round.

This one just hits everything we love: worker placement, action point selection, resource management, dice manipulation, variable player powers, and the like. Rules look like they'd be pretty tough but they're surprisingly simple when you get right down to it. Performances are the only really odd bit and they're pretty easy to do once you step through the rules in a game for the first time. Some real tough choices to make throughout the game. Everything just flows beautifully. Love this one! Unfortunately doesn't hit the table quite often as I like because of its length and setup time. A real pain to teach.

A nice design with interesting theme... for an extremely dry euro. Lots of fiddly elements and not the most interesting decisions to make. The wages mechanism does defuse the usual worker placement tactic of rushing to have the most workers, but there just isn't many interesting things to do with the workers, even if you had them. Timing is everything... which isn't really enough. Not something I want to play again in hurry, but the design is solid enough.

Előrebocsátom, hogy még a tesztelés alatt álló, nem végleges játékot próbáltam (ilyen is ritkán adatik meg, köszönöm a lehetőséget), ezt figyelembe vettem az értékelésnél. Ennek megfelelően vannak még kisebb-nagyobb hibák, amiken lehetne (kellene is) csiszolni, de alapvetően már így is tök jól működik. A másik amit előrebocsátok, hogy csak a legalapabb változatot próbáltuk, a harmadik, hogy elfogult vagyok, mert ilyen komplexitású magyar játék tudtommal még nem készült, vagy ha készült is, nem kapott ekkora publicitást. Ez utóbbi miatt nagyon szurkolok a játéknak, na de most nézzük a részleteket.
Először is jó az egyedi témaválasztás... ha valakinek nem jut eszébe a Trickerion, elég ha annyit mond: "az a bűvészes játék". Másrészt a témához szerintem nagyon jól passzol a mechanizmus, átjön a tematika az egész játékon. Maga a mechanika pedig tartalmaz nagyon jó ötleteket, pl. az hogy a felhasználható akciópontok 2 részből tevődnek össze, nagyon tetszik. A titkos kártyaválasztással sincs bajom, bár nem tudom ez benne lesz-e a véglegesben, mert tény hogy emiatt tripla olyan hosszú, mintha simán csak lepakolgatnánk az embereket. Így szerintem izgalmasabb, nem zavar ha marad, ráadásul ha hoppon marad az emberünk, nem muszáj munkába küldeni és akkor nem kell etetni. A 3 segítő jó lett, bár az egyik kicsit gyengébbnek tűnik. Jó a gyémánt vagy micsoda, visz bele némi rugalmasságot, de nincs úgy túlzásba víve, mint a Cavernánál. A tárgyak beszerzése is jó, előjegyzés, egyebek. A színházas rész pedig alapvetően a legeredetibb rész, a linkek nekem kifejezetten tetszettek. Egy bajunk volt a 4 napos dologgal: a végén aki vezet pontokban, az a fordított sorrend miatt gyakorlatilag tuti hogy a csütörtököt kapja, ami szívás, max vészmegoldásokkal lehet kicsit enyhíteni a kárt. Szerintem a 4 napos sávot kicsit árnyalni kellene, túl nagy a különbség a csütörtök és a vasárnap között. Egyébként ezt leszámítva ez a legjobb része a játéknak, és mindenképp a legtematikusabb része, számomra sokkal jobb ebből a szempontból mint mondjuk a hasonló rész a Colosseumnál: egy műsor trükkökből épül fel, és a nézők díjazzák ha gördülékeny az átmenet a trükkök közt, és az is természetes, hogy ha más trükkjét adjuk elő, akkor neki is fizetünk ezért jogdíjat. És az is oké, hogy csütörtökön kevesebb a néző. Ez a rész nagyon erős tematikailag. 
Kérdés számomra még hogy pl. a trükkök mennyire vannak egyensúlyozva.
Szerencsefüggőség szerintem tolerálható: a kockadobás a kör elején és az hogy a színházi előadásokba hány trükk fér el.
Külsőségek: nekem tetszik a grafika (trükkfüzet rohadt jó), de a főtáblán zavaróan kicsik az ikonok, a rajzok viszont túl sok helyet foglalnak. A játékostáblák pedig nyugodtan tartalmazhatnák már eleve a 3-3 segéd infóit, az egész elférne fele ekkora helyen.
Mint már említettem, csak az alapot próbáltam (szabállyal együtt így is elment vele 4 és fél óra), a teljes változathoz még irtó sok kártya tartozik és a tábla kb. egynegyede. Tehát a java részét még nem ismerem, csak szabályvázlatot hallottam róla, de az alapján biztató.

Összességében remélem a végső csiszolásokkal olyan játék lesz, ami megállja a helyét a nemzetközi élmezőnyben. Már így is kiadható lenne egyébként, de egy-két nagyon apró javítás is sokat dobna rajta. 

Szívesen kipróbálnám a véglegeset is!

Magnificent! I love the theme of us being illusionists having to learn, craft, and perform tricks onstage. The artwork is great. I usually don't love "drab" colors but it works perfectly for this game. The components are above average with the large cardboard player mats and silkscreened wooden tokens. Mechanically the game is a worker placement Euro but the depth is huge. This game almost requires you to plan out your entire game right from the start and then build up to it. Probably the most strategic worker placement game I've played. But it's not that simple because the simultaneous reveal of location assignments means you're having to weigh priorities and jockeying for the best positions at each location each round. Then you add in the Dark Alley elements of the prophecies, Special Assignment cards, and Magician character powers and it piles on the complexity. Also with the variety of tricks to learn, prophecies, performances, and other semi-random elements there is tons of replayability in the box. None of the randomness is game-breaking or too swingy which you don't want in a game of this size. It's just there for variety. 

I do have two negatives that keep this game from being a complete 10. The first is the performances and placing the tricks. While the majority of the game feels pretty thematic, once you get to the step of choosing which tricks to place on the performance cards and then ultimately "performing" the shows, all the theme goes out the window. It's a total min/max MENSA puzzle at that point and I never felt like I was performing anything. For sure, it's an interesting puzzle to solve but it's also the driest element of the game when it should be the most thematic. The second negative is game length. The advanced game will run about 1hr/player which means you have to really commit to playing this. I would avoid playing this with any AP-prone types as people can easily sit and think about turns for quite some time if you really wanted to. This is just a minor negative though because that also means in-between turns you're always thinking through your moves so you're rarely bored. It's a real brain-burner!

I have a major compliment for the game designers and that is including the Magician's Workbooks for each player that shows all the tricks. This is such a great idea! Especially in a game like this where future planning is so crucial it's so much easier to flip through a few pages than always grabbing a deck of cards and looking at them one at a time.

Comments based on playing the game with the expansions. I have not played the base game alone.

A very fun and thematic game with wonderful components and artwork, but the game is incredibly long at four players when including the Dark Alleys and Magician's Powers expansion. I would recommend playing it with three players with just the Dark Alleys expansion to cut down on playing time while still maintaining somewhat of the the full experience. 

 There are some issues that seem to be underdeveloped and it seemed that some of the Magician's Powers cards were a little too powerful given that you are randomly dealt 12 and pick 8 at the start of the game. If you happen to get certain combos or better cards, you seem to have an advantage.

I've played with and without the Magician's Power expansion and it seemed more balanced without it. That said, if you are looking for a fun time, play with it. If you are looking for a more balanced game, a chess match, play without it.

 The game has a lot of flavor and theme and was fun to play; albeit too long. Trickerion taken as an experience or thematic endeavor will shine more than taken as a chess game.

A heavy euro game in it's best tradition. We got the game to test right from the designers, and we were not disappointed! The game is fantastic. The theme is interesting and works pretty well, you can feel the atmosphere which is also because of the amazing artworks and design. The creators really thought of each and every detail - like providing every player with a "magician workbook", which you can study to learn new tricks :)
The basic mechanics are coming from a worker placement gameplay, but you have to plan your move for the round in advance - either you want to gain new materials for your tricks, or need to gain more money, find a pretty assistant for your performance, or learn new tricks. Or if you feel yourself well-prepared enough, you can finally go to the theatre to show your magical tricks to the public :)

Brilliant theme, perfectly working ideas and mechanics. It's not a short game with it's 3-4 hours playing time (while the playing time definitely will be reduced if you play with it more), but it absolutely worth it, and you will definitely enjoy this game!

Nem egyszerű erről a játékról véleményt írnom. Egyszer játszottam és alapjátékkal.
A kivitelezés minősége egyszerűen tökéletes. A hangulattal nehezen barátkoztam meg, de a fa alkatrészek, kártyák és táblák egyszerűen prémium kategóriába röpítik a játékot.
Van benne pár elem, mely eddig nem volt ismert számomra, de nem tartom akkora újításnak, hogy nem azt mondjam erről a játékról, hogy egy jól összeollózott játék. Nincs szükségem mindig az új ötletekre, ha az eddig megszokottak összhangban vannak egymással.
Én rövidnek tartom a a játékot úgy minden 5-6 körös játékot, hisz sok elemet a már a játék közepétől nem sok értelme így megszerezni a végső pontozást kivéve. Emellett pedig hosszú időtartalmú játék.
A legnagyobb negatívumát abban látom, hogy nagyon be vagyunk korlátozva a teendőkkel kapcsolatban. Például az alsóvárosba nem érdemes bűvész nélkül menni, mert különben kevés akció pontom lesz, ha viszont oda megyek, akkor nem tudok előadni. Én például bűvészként nem rohangásznék a való életben sem ha van inasom.
Összességében annyira tetszik a játék, hogy szívesen látnám a gyűjteményemben, de csakis kiegészítőkkel!

2015, 2-4p, 75+ min, heavy, AP-prone Euro. Clunky, slow, wkr pl, simult axn selec, gameplay doesn't fit with the theme, lots of build-up that fizzles at the end... Note: your goods never go away when you use them to buy tricks. Lots of options, choices and decisions (where to send workers, what to have workers do there and if buying a trick/item, which one will you pick), thus it can be slow for players that aren't AP-prone.  The goods procurement mechanism is kind of annoying where you have to spend a turn placing an order for the item (saw, wood, pigeon, metal, etc.) to show up in the shop and then hope that you can buy them before an opponent.  Advanced game with var play pow and specialized movement cards seems better/more interesting.  So much of the game is spent collecting resources and the resource system is wonky since the store only contains 4 items at a time.

Played once and really looked forward to this. Played the base version (without the Dark Alley) and it was a bit 'meh'.

The feel of the game reminded me of Colloseum; You have to choose and put up  performances that require a (preferably overlapping) set of props to do so. That's probably where the comparison ends because in Trickerion connecting it all is a bit more of a hassle.

There's no bidding or trading to get the props you need. There is a lot of next turn planning; Setting up the goods market, preparing tricks, lining up performances on stage... All these steps are performed through worker placement spots. There are two twists though; Before placing workers, each player first has to secretly assign them (blind planning). The second is that workers have different action points (1 to 3). Claiming a worker spot provides action points from that spot, combined with the action points of that worker. More action points means more can be done (multiple actions, manipulating prices, change die results, etc.)

My main gripe is probably that I didn't particularly like the sort of planning needed to make everything work. The blind assignment and the weird placement puzzle for setting up the theater stage with all its bonusses felt like control is lost too easily. Not to mention the planning for the market. It's just one layer of unpredictability too many it seemed.

I'll have to play it once again, I guess, This time with the Dark Alley. Maybe I will like it better knowing how all the gears interlock.

Inital rating after a couple of plays of base and one of full game (2 player), so rating might change.

Heavy euro that has a pretty well integrated theme (actual magic performance is a bit abstract with placing tricks on a card).

Like it BUT OMG don't try this with anyone with AP tendencies, unless you want to watch them get a brain freeze. There's a lot going on here, and a lot to think about (without trying to figure what other people might be planning), anyone who can't make decisions or wants to plan to the nth degree is going to take an AGE to play each turn.

Saying that, with the right players this is great (and it scales well from 2-4)

When you like Drum Roll, Colloseum and Shakespeare then probably you will love Trickerion. I tested it and my thoughts are it is deep thought kind of a game and good quality of the wooden chips and counter. Bonus:
thematical well done. A delight of the fair 2015.
The 2nd match was within the Dark Alley expansion and so i had to mention that this comes with light & shadow in the Dark Alleys. With the bad things first: The cards can provide some random between the stage direction and the shows and the main problem: Each card is worth two prestige points, so you can always try to get 1 or 2 of the precious DA cards with a small assistant. Thats much Prestigepoints and the DA cards should better be worth 1 point, because the weakest Riverside theater show are only worth 1 point. And additionally the use of DA cards is unlimited. The players are allowed to use one of them without a manager and a technic assistant. When you recruited both of them, you can use two DA cards per turn, so the random in the 7 turns could keeped minimized.

I have played through 3 games so far: 2 with the base game only, and 1 with the Dark Alley expansion. It took a while to wrap my head around the rules, and the first game I scored the theater wrong (I realized this literally on the second performance of the final turn, so I ended up finishing the game using the wrong rules) and setting up too many performance cards in the theater. 

That said, I really liked the game. A LOT. It might even be a 10 for me, but I'll have to give it a few more plays. I think that adding in the 2 player variant makes it much better, because it means that there isn't always a choice between "all or nothing" bonus in the various districts. Adding in Dark Alley shoots the variableness up even higher thanks to the little cards you buy. I have to play that one again because I went TOO crazy with hiring people, without getting enough cards in the Dark Alley to use them effectively.

I could go on and on, because I really liked the game; I even had to stop myself from playing because it was getting too late. My one and only issue is that it takes up a lot of space! However, I can easily remedy that by getting a bigger table!

I was one of the backers for this game and I will say that I definitely got my money's worth for this game. The game is beautiful and there are a ton of components. Based upon a single play, I feel the gameplay is solid, but man... there's a lot going on.

This is probably the heaviest worker placement game(though, there's a lot more going on than just worker placement) I've played. It will take me several plays to feel like I have a grasp on how this game should go, but I'm fine with having a few games like that in my collection.

I've now played a few games of this and man, the weight might be the biggest killer here. Playing with the Dark Alley expansion and 4 players, 7 rounds felt like too many. At the end of the game, it was really draining.

I'm thinking this might be best with three experienced players otherwise you're looking at a game that may drag on too much.

First play was 4p, 5 rounds with dark alley and no magician powers. 

Programming is interesting because you set up a "dream" turn only to have someone mess with it and you need backup, either with shards or something. Leaving tricks unperformed sucks but is entirely on the player imo. Something to consider. 

Deserves more plays but rating will depend on whether the fun is worth the length of play.

Feh, not falling in to the hype of this game.  It took us 4 hours to play, and it felt like a 90 minute game tops...  Everything was intuitive enough, and the theme was definitely strong.  It didn't help that I got told to not do something in my first turn that the other people that had already played that game absolutely did...  I was still trying to understand the game anyways.  Somewhat fiddly.  I like that there always seemed to be something for me to do, and something to aim towards.  I don't mind losing my first game, but I do mind the game taking 4 hours to play...  I will be saying no thanks to this one for a while, I think.

I quite liked the theme and gameplay, but the endgame has issues in the regular game. But the other versions greatly add to the playing time and complexity it seems. Between this and Arkwright, played around the same time, I am kind of annoyed at the 3 different versions of the game included in the box. These are heavy games. Heavy gamers are capable of getting them in game 1. No need for the intro versions.

Fiddly Nanny-State smorgasbord where efficiency is punished through the turn-order mechanism (by far the most important element of this overwrought game).  Perform even modestly well in the early turns and you will get to sit and watch other players earn bonus actions, get discounts on the easiest (oh, and they are one-of-a-kind, by the way) illusions, leave you with the least desirable performance slots, and slingshot past you mid-game with no viable mechanism for you to respond.  No other game in memory offers you the opportunity to put together a fabulous engine and then encourages you not to use it.

Not 100% sure how I feel about this game after 1 play.  So many fiddly components/rules and the placing-trick mini-game seems completely unnecessary.  And then there's the dice rolls and the 1st place player (going into the final round) being severely punished on the final turn due to the turn ordering rules and the theatre performance penalties (where it matters most).  Love everything else about the game though.

It looked like I was going to like it, but ultimately it fell flat. I don't like games that present huge menus at the beginning which are you forced to make a plan through. And I also don't like games where you have to look over into other player's areas for details that become super important to you. I want the info that's important to me to be easily visible. Some nice ideas though. Will definitely try their next one. Whatever that time traveling game is called.

This might be the best worker placement game I've ever played.

Gorgeous game, high quality components (KS edition).

In this game, you're a stand-up magician, trying to prepare and act tricks on stage.
You'll gather components and plan your week in order to get the best rewards for your tricks.

You'll get help from your apprentices, assistant, manager and engineer (last three having special abilities).

Each worker as a value, so some will be more efficient than others.

There is plenty of content in the base game (5 turns, family friendly), and this just becomes amazing if you include the expansions (included in the KS edition): 7 turns, magician powers, dual-action cards, harder tricks, new places to go, etc. This will please any core gamer.

This is truly a fantastic game!

Someone I was playing with (Eric) said this had a lot of game mechanics thrown in and I agree.  Its a fun game.  Learning curve is a little high.

Why I got rid of it:

The performance area seemed tacked on to try to web some more decisions into the game but it felt bland.  The worker selection was "run of the mill" and many other games work about the same.

The theme and the vast amount of stuff that you get are the primary draws here. the game is good, but probably overly complex and has the traditional Kickstarter need of a developer. I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't just make this a real world game set in the age of the great stage magicians, perhaps even using the real ones and giving them specialties. Regardless, it still sort of has that feel, and is worth the occasional play just due to its uniqueness.

[6 Oct 2017] - 7.5 (1 play, 1 learning play)
After 2 years, I finally played this game. After getting the KS, I felt that the game was going to be too heavy but once we finally played it we found that it was on par with a lot of other games that we enjoy. All of the individual pieces are easy to understand by themselves but does take a bit of planning to get the overall flow of the game down. I suspect that it will become easier with additional plays. The theater action spots do have a bunch of exceptions that make it different than the other action spots, which does add complexity. Also not consuming resources when preparing tricks feels unusual as compared to other resource acquisition games.  Some of the icons on the board are probably the biggest hurdle to overcome.

We only played the tutorial, which left us hanging.

Good fun, though the basic game without Dark Alleys is a bit simple with 2 players as options for apprentice placement is limited and frustrating. Since there is a decent amount of stuff going on, I still suggest trying this out first (maybe 3 turns) and then moving over the Dark Alleys side of the board and adding more chrome (special abilities, advanced player abilities, etc..) as you deem necessary. Good interaction with lots of stuff to do with an original theme that works. Similar to colosseum, only much more complex. Overall a very enjoyable game and one of my top games of 2015.

[2017-10-13: First Impression]
Color me impressed! My first play of Trickerion, although quite long since we dived in the deep end of the pool and used all expansions, was a very entertaining and satisfying affair. While there are some rough edges when it comes to performing tricks, where I'm not sure if I do really need the routine puzzle part of it, Trickerion is a hugely enjoyable mixture of mechanics. Especially the secret assignment of locations to your workers coupled with the subsequently round-robin dispatching of them works really well and gives you a lot to crunch on.
On to the bad news: I believe this is not a game for everyone. You do really have to like long and complex optimization games in order to enjoy Trickerion. Otherwise this could be a long and painful gaming session.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For now, I rate this an 8 because it has been the absolute most rewarding Kickstarted game to which I have had the pleasure of throwing money.  That does not mean I am biased because I kickstarted it, but more to say that I am surprised at just how much I enjoyed this game as my expectations for crowdfunded games isn't exactly high.

Trickerion combines popular game elements (as new games often do) like worker placement and action selection, among other things, to great success.  Unlike other armchair-designed stuff, the hodgepodge of ideas here click together wonderfully.  At no point did I feel like things were done just for the sake of having them done, except perhaps - PERHAPS - the poster cards (which I actually enjoy, but mechanically, they do nothing a simple token couldn't accomplish).

The included two-player variant - which may or may not be in the production copy - works well for keeping the variety going.  I have not yet tried the other two expansions (Dark Alley and Magic Powers) as of this writing, but given the experience so far, I'm confident they will work well.

Components and art is excellent, evocative of the theme which the game surprisingly expresses well in its play.  Euros tend to feel themeless, but Trickerion somehow manages to convey the idea of being an illusionist competing for supremacy quite well.  The available spaces on the board all work together to sell the idea that you are hiring up a team, buying materials, and working to put on a terrific show.  While the resolution of the shows themselves could use a little more pizzazz in the theme department, it still clicks together beautifully.

I will say that the game feels too short in the base game as players only get 5 turns to gather what they need and perform their stuff.  This can be mitigated by hiring more hands, but at the same time, hiring more hands means you need to pay them, and if you don't perform, you don't get paid, and if you don't get paid, you can't pay your staff, and if you can't pay your staff, they'll cut your throat while you sleep... okay, maybe not that last bit.

But could you imagine not getting paid for the work you do, especially if you have to run around and prep magic tricks, getting absolutely no credit in the performance other than to boost the hoity-toity magician's fame?  I'd totally cut his throat while he slept.

Moving on - I do want to make one special mention of the ability, except in one category, to choose the gender of your magician and their specialists.  It makes no difference to the actual gameplay, but it is a nice touch in an age where gender politics is front and center in popular entertainment.  Simply having alternative art is a fantastic idea and very inclusive.  Kudos are well-deserved here.

Game is pretty but something did not clicked.
Preparation before game takes too long for me.

The base game is far too easy and too simple for us. With additional location is better but it is not so easy to read all the text on the cards. If you add all the expansions game is too long and there is a lot more to read before playing (all the cards). So to make it simple, game is ok but apparently not for me.

And of course prepare a big table to play comfortably :)

Kudos to the team for their very professionally run Kickstarter campaign.  I also really enjoy this theme and the components are lovely.  The gameplay feels pretty good with a few exceptions.  It seems odd to "program" where all of your workers will go prior to placement.  This really limits your ability to change course if another player takes the action you want.  There were several turns that I lost actions because of this.  I really wish there was a way to regroup if your plans are disrupted.  Additionally the trick performing phase felt a bit fiddly.  I might get more used to this in subsequent plays but my initial reaction to trick performing is that it is needlessly complex.

The AP system is brilliant. I love the idea of a WP game that doesn't block people out, but still manages to benefit those that arrive first. However, a very mean type of take-that is prominent both Downtown, and at Market Row, which often feels worse than blocking. The base game is too shallow and short, but the Dark Alley expansion makes the game incredibly long. Granted, everything fits well within that extended duration, but the length will certainly limit plays over its lifetime. I was worried that certain mechanisms would feel tacked on, but in practice found them quite thematic and necessary. It doesn't ooze theme, but considering its a Euro, it comes very close.

RATING: 10
A dazzling thematic euro-game.  Plays well with the "Automa" solitaire mode posted in the "Variants" forum, and is deliciously rich in meaningful strategic and tactical choices as well as a wide array of interacting factors to consider.  

This is one of those games I love playing slowly over several sessions, savoring each choice point's possibilities and allowing the theme to shine through and tell its story.  The variable character starting abilities and ongoing customization/development opportunities also add another level to gameplay while also enhancing replayability.

And the artwork is excellent, fitting in nicely with both the theme and the era.

Dark Alley cards are small, and a player card would help that.  For me, I love it.  For others, it may be tough to get this to the table because of game length and complexity.

Too bad this one takes to effing long to play. I really really like the theme and it's also a really good game. 
Having to look up tricks all the time in your player ais tends to feel a bit fiddly and detached from the rest of the table, but nothing too bad really. 
I love the simultaneous planning of where to send people and how your different workers have different abilities. As well as having to choose where to be first and get the bonus action points and stuff like that. I really enjoy these complicated games with tense action selection and a good theme.

I love, love, love:
- the simultaneous action selection mechanism
- the action point system
- the artwork and theme
- the "performance flow" mechanism
- the different workers and their individual bonuses
- that the game rewards multiple plays, allowing you to slowly master the game
- the manageable randomness of the dice rolls
- the asymmetric magicians and their powers
- the ability to advertise for fame
- the changing two-player variant

I dislike:
- the look of the female assistant--the pronounced chest and tiniest, maybe even realistically unachievable, waist is a bit off
- the Trickerion stone (it's kinda gimmicky, as is the weirdness of learning tricks from the very person we're trying to impress with our performance expertise)

Final verdict: Awesome medium-heavy Euro with mechanisms I greatly enjoy despite my initial hesitance/distaste at first glance. The theme comes through, but the performance cards still FEEL gimmicky (even though I know they're supposed to simulate the planning of the best performance flow), as does the Trickerion stone/shards.

With Dark Alley + the magician powers + asymmetrical magician abilities, this game achieves hallmark status. The strategy is deep, tons of interesting decisions to make, and the player interaction can be rather intense, which is surprising for a Eurogame. Just top notch all around, and I can't help but love the theme and artwork.

This game is really heavy and maybe even a little convoluted. But it has one of the coolest, most unique themes I have seen in a game. It is basically The Prestige or The Illusionist, only a board game.

Despite the interesting theme this one is really dry and actually quite complex euro which can be quite punishing if you fall behind.... and so so beige!
This was a very slow (6+hrs) play through as this has a heck of a lot of moving parts, its pretty overwhelming at first play and as such was not the most enjoyable experience however I can see the potential.
 
We missed a couple of rules, namely the placing of tricks on shows but the added complexity of the actual rule does not seem to provide anything but complexity for complexities sake. 

I was sort of hoping this played a bit like the pot of the film The prestige and as magicians we keep trying to one up each other or nobble each other however it is pretty light on the interactions, at most you can take a trick before someone else. Getting to action spaces earlier just means you gain a few extra actions points with which to take the actions but you do not actually stop an opponent visiting that space.

The board is beautiful and the theme refreshing.  Hard choices, not enough moves, worker placement, resource management--a strong Euro game for sure.  

I wish the icons were larger and some of them less confusing--it took me a long time to identify the shard icon (looks like a blob), and I kept incorrectly thinking the "M" icon was for Manager, not the money it was (I kept looking for the $ sign).  This resulted in confusion with the Performance scoring.  Once I understand the scoring better, I suspect my rating of this game will increase.  

Time restriction kept us on the beginning side, but looking forward to playing the longer side, with expansions!

Kickstarted this due to the utterly gorgeous art & graphic design, and wanted to add a worker-placement style game to my collection. Unfortunately never got it to the table with more than 2 players, and never finished a game. Simply too complex and long for me and those who I would play with. Can't think of any of my friends who would enjoy this, so getting rid. If you like lovely-looking Euro's with worker-placement and a good long playtime, you'll probably like this. Didn't play with the expansions unfortunately, but received both from the Kickstarter, along with some cloth bags for components and currency.

P.S. I would take my rating with a generous pinch of salt. I simply didn't play it enough to be able to properly assess it, therefore I'm rating it square in the middle of the scale.

If Trickerion is anything like magic or illusion then those must be rather like accounting. It is a heavily front-loaded and otherwise fairly standard worker placement game with a lot of fiddy details yet very little interaction or actual game. Basically, you're charting your way through the menu of magic tricks (which isn't any different from a shared tableau of buildings to build or contracts to fulfill or what have you).
The actual worker placement phase strongly punishes the leading player(s), to the point where it becomes utterly unattractive to do anything but ride out your hopefully well-built performances. A spreadsheet of options, all of them very much calculable and many of them non-viable and there just to add some more downtime to an already overlong game.

TRICKERION ist eine Illusionswelt: es gaukelt einem Zauberei vor, ist aber hinter dem roten Samtvorhang seiner Bühnenshow ein Planungs- und Optimierbrett wie es exceltabelliger nicht sein könnte. Jeder Trick ist knallhartes Kalkül. Es mag den Träumer enttäuschen, dass die Zauberwelt nur austauschbare Fassade aus Pappmaché ist, entspricht aber in seiner Idee dann tatsächlich der Welt der erwerbstätigen Zauberei, die mit Verblüffung spielt, aber mit Berechnung ihr Geld verdient. In seiner kalkulierenden Grundstruktur ist TRICKERION ökonomisches Management mit dem Rechenschieber für Zahlenfreunde, die schon mit Algebra ihren Spass hatten. Wenngleich TRICKERION die Magie völlig abgeht, die es thematisch verspricht, so ist es in dem, was es bietet, klar und eindeutig. Seine Gestalt ist entzückend, das Material zauberhaft, das Spieldesign bei allem gewöhnlichen Wizard Placement mit Aktionspunkten auch kleinteilig. Was TRICKERION vermissen lässt, ist letztendlich das, was ein Spiel halt auch sein sollte: ein Spiel. Der Verpackungstrick hat auf jeden Fall schon mal geklappt.

I am through with games like this.  Yes it may be serviceable, or even good., but the front-loaded learning and micro action/worker placement/efficiency engine is just boring.  

I miss the early 2000s, late 90s.  We played Samurai, Paris Paris, and Tigris after.  Those games take so much less time, have a page or two of rules, and in concert, offer many more interesting moments and decisions than one of these modern fiascos.  

Lovely production, but lack luster game.

Update: Played again.  I retract the idea that this might be good.  This game is horrid. The valuation of actions is off, the beginning assistants have dramatically unbalanced powers, the randomness of the dice mixed with the expense in energy to perform an action downtown is a mess.  

The decision space is minimal but the money is tight.  This is accounting not magic.  

Who finds this fun?

What a mess of mechanisms, which almost manages to come together flawlessly. The 2 player experience can lack competition for performances, especially with certain magicians powers. I feel like I need to play this with more player counts to see if the length gets blown out too much with more players. Something undeniably appealing about the theme and design.

Finally a super-thematic euro! I love the theme and every rule can be explained thematically. It still has a lot of rules though, it's a pretty complex game. The board is very clear and explains all of the relevant rules, so in practise the rules are easy to understand and remember, it's just a lot to go through before the game can begin. I love action selection and this game does it wonderfully, there's a ridiculous amount of tension and choice during both the action selection and worker placement phases, because of their connection to each other. There's a ridiculous amount of interaction and I'm always invested in all other players' turns. 

The included expansion adds to the complexity and gives a lot more choices, theme and variability and I think it's a lot of fun. I'm not sure about the balance, though. Some special powers seem objectively better than other. 

It's an absolutely brilliant design, it does everything I want in a game, the only problem is that the length and complexity makes it hard to get played.

So for a long time I struggled with having both this and A Feast For Odin in my collection as heavy worker placements. I think I have more fun playing Feast, but this is *way* more competitive and I really like that. Sometimes you want to compete! Plus this is my favorite theme of any game I've ever had/played and the art is just beautiful. But since this is my favorite weight of game, and the weight I get to play least frequently, it's a very hard spot to justify keeping in my collection and I wouldn't have if the gameplay wasn't superb as well. 

Also, the length/complexity of this game is very modular and it's easy to customize the experience to not be so long or intimidating (though it doesn't outright explain how to do this in the rules. For ex. my favorite way to play is with the advanced board but no prophecy and no player powers). In fact, I have yet to play with every module at once.

I think I'd like this game more if it had more visual appeal for me. The graphic design is nice enough, but doesn't draw me into the game. At the end of it, I'm still left feeling like I've just been playing the mechanics and the (really amazing) theme was wasted.

This is a game that I likely have problems with due to my cognitive issues because I can't seem to make a lot of sense of the mechanics through the theme.

Trickerion has a bit of everything and is exceedingly strategic. Programming, set collection, and worker placement all lead to building a grand schedule of tricks to put on a show. With many considerations and special abilities for each worker and location, the game earns its hefty  "weight" rating, but by midway through the first game, it becomes smooth and understandable. The weight seems to come from its strategic focus. There are tactical decisions, but the game lies mainly in a grand plan to success. Trickerion is a game where anyone who plays it multiple times will enjoy it more each time, and those who only play it once will likely be turned off by the strategic wall to overcome. The theme is one of the most present for a euro-style game. The game is worth the cost of admission to see the tricks Trickerion offers.

While this is a nice thematic game that's working well, there's too much (fiddly) stuff pressed in. What keeps me away from it, is the missing overview, due to very small icons and as mentioned before, to much stuff in the whole.

It also takes way too long for what it is (played the 7 round expansion) and is like the rich gets richer (you need points to get better tricks).

It works, it has a cool theme and is far from a bad game, but that's just not enough these days.

Bear in mind that I've only played once. Though I ended up winning and usually that biases me towards liking the game. I'm not really a connoisseur of euros, but I felt like this one didn't have much going for it besides the fun theme (though thematic integration is low). Despite the multitudes of tricks you COULD learn (so many that the player aid is actually a small booklet), you will really have to lock in your strategy pretty early, and will only end up learning about 3 tricks in the course of the game.  It also seemed like you often needed to accurately predict where other people were going to go (even with only 3 players) and failing to do so could be quite catastrophic. I didn't find either of those aspects appealing. But it's definitely not bad, it's just kind of "okay". A lot of upfront rules overhead for pretty linear choices. Another BGG'er may have said it best:

I was overwhelmed upon first learning the game (lots of moving parts), then underwhelmed at the end game (fell flat).

RATING: 6.5
Thematically great, artwork and design fantastic. Game play is pretty smooth, most mechanisms make sense, the action point system is great, the market with a pre-ordering concept, as well. But: there's a lot to keep track of, it's *close* to fiddlyness. You could definitely do without the Dark Alley prophecies wheel; the pattern matching on the final stage cards is thematic and a very unique design, but it's also tedious to track your opponents tricks and then calculate through the possibilities to gain the most benefits by matching and rotating when placing your tricks. And I usually do not like choosing cards from a huge collection, like the new learned tricks in this case. For me, there is too choice, too much long-term strategy; ultimately it's too heavy for me.

All in all, Trickerion is a labour of love. It's gorgeous and for the most parts coherent. I still believe that a “Big Publisher” would have convinced the designers to cut 10-15% of the mechanics (and components ;) to lower the required mental effort you need to play (and the costs).

Man hat nicht wirklich das Gefühl am Ende einer Runde eine richtige Zaubershow aufgeführt zu haben. Die komplexen Mechaniken (allein das Ausführen der Aktionen ist eine Mischung aus Programmieren, Workerplacement und Ausgeben von Aktionspunkten) erschweren den Einstieg, besonders für Gelegenheitsspieler. Außerdem haben es Personen schwer, die zu einer erfahrenen Spielergruppe hinzustoßen. Die Materialqualität ist überragend!

Heavy euro that uses a lot of different mechanics.  You need to plan out your end-game from turn one.  Mechanics for putting on a show are kind of weird.  Definite opportunity to screw over opponents.  Great production value.

Absolutely beautiful game. The artwork is fantastic and the mechanics are mind boggling. In a standard game without the Dark Alley, you likely need to play for the final round during the setup of the game. It is a very cutthroat magician battle. I may have only played 3 times but it is a permanent on my shelf.

Really just too much going on here. There's a good game buried under excess complexity both a) drags out game time as players try to puzzle through too many moving pieces; and b) increases your chance of having your planned turn go cripplingly awry. The theme is nicely interwoven and the presentation is good, but I just don't find this enjoyable.

Apoyado en kicstarter. 
De momento habiendo probado solo la versión de 2 jugadores del modo más básico, el juego da la sensación de tener muchísima chicha que rascar y, pese a mis temores, es muy llevadero. No se hace nada largo, es más, te quedas con ganas de más. Un 8 por ahora, pero según vaya jugándolo más y añadiendo mecánicas puede convertirse en uno de mis preferidos.
Tras una partida a 3 le sigo viendo muchísimas posibilidades, el juego tiene una profundidad que se ve desde el primer momento.
Jugado por fin a 4 jugadores y con la parte del dark alley, es un muy buen juego pero no para ser jugado a diario.

Surely a working design but it's mechanical, forced and arbitrary at the same time.
The theme (magicians, tricks, performances) would seem to constitute a strong suite, but it's not the case in reality.  It's not quite felt during the game.

Definitely not my type of a game.

RATING: 6
If you're an aspiring magician this is probably the game for you to get. The theme comes to live in this game. You get to learn a ton of tricks for your show (48 total to be exact!), purchase props for those tricks and hire specialists to be part of your crew. While all these sounds very exciting, in reality the performance section of the game is really bland. You're just matching little tokens on a card and you call that a "performance"? I don't understand after putting all that flavor into the game, how can you call something that abstract as a "performance"? 

The game tempo is also incredibly slow. It felt like it takes forever to get something done. And when you get to the really exciting part, the Level 3 tricks, the game ends. What an absolute letdown. A lot of the dragginess in the game also involves reading the many Special Action cards from Dark Alley and the Magician Power cards since every one of them is incredibly different than another. I know it adds variety to the game, but it also adds unnecessary bloat to an already complex game. Wish they would've done a lighter version of the game focusing on purely the worker placement aspect of the game.

RATING: 8
This game was a lot of fun. There are a lot of modules to include at your choice. I'd say dark alley is great, almost necessary to make the game interesting. By contrast the special powers you get based on which magician you are I don't care for at all, and they could be completely thrown out. I'm somewhat on the fence about the power cards that you get at the start of the game. It might be worth trying to draft them. I was hopeful that at least the mechanic of scheduling and performing tricks would have something interesting in it, and it wasn't bad, but it still felt mostly straightforward. But there were cool end game scoring opportunities between the third level tricks and the cards that I think you should draft. But probably the best thing about this game is deciding your path through the tricks in a way that's most component efficient while also giving you the right kinds of payouts, getting you to the endgame bonus you want, and giving you the right mix of types of tricks to make good links. Overall a somewhat straightforward game (i.e. almost everything just does the one thing it says it does) but there are enough moving parts and fun thematic flourishes to make it interesting.

First play was 5 hours (three newbies out of four). No doubt that would go down with experience, but I don't like it enough to really want to play even a 2-3 hour version of it. It's an interesting theme: in most games with magic, it's real magic not stage magic.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2016)

Trickerion was utterly unknown to me before I played it, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. However, I’m very glad I played it as I liked it a lot!

The theme is novel and interesting (to me) and the game´s mechanisms support the theme (a rarity in Euro games).

The game bits are gorgeous and the art is awesome! Overall, Trickerion has great production values.

The rules aren’t very complex, but there are many rules. The player aid alone is a whole brochure and when we all saw the aid we thought Trickerion was a very heavy game, but in reality it is a medium weight game. The game explanation can take up to 25 minutes but the rules make sense so the game flows easily.

Playtime is around the 3 hour mark, but I didn’t feel downtime so I don’t care about the length.

I have only played the basic version of the game, but I really liked what I saw. The game has lots of interesting decisions (where to send your workers, who to hire, who to send to do a particular task, what resources to get, what trick to create and/or perform, which day of the week to perform). Money is very tight in the game and at the end of each week you have to pay your employees. I love it! I hope to play the full game soon.

I particularly like the preprogramed action phase, you have to plan ahead and predict your opponents´ moves, it is very similar to Asgard´s, a game I also played for the first time this month.

There are some luck with the dice and the resources needed to build your tricks, however I think you can manage it so it doesn’t bother me for now.

I regret I didn’t back Trickerion on Kickstarter. I generally don´t back unknown games (because many of them are worthless). I have only backed reprints (Carson City, Vinhos) or expansions (Keyflower: The Merchants, Pixel Tactics Deluxe) but I really like Trickerion. I´m not sure what are the differences between the retail and the KS editions.

Bottom line, I really like Trickerion and I don’t have anything negative to say about the game (I still need to try the full game). Trickerion is my kind of game and surely it will get and upgraded rating from me with more plays. It is a “must have” for me and I will buy it soon. I’m pretty sure my SO will love the game.

Current Rating: 7.5

I was right, after one more lay I upgraded the rating of the game. I find it fascinating :D, my desire to play Trickerion again is very high.

Sadly, my copy of Trickerion came with wrinkled boards because they were loose on the inside :(.

Also the setup is explained on page 4 of the rules, this is a minor issue but I prefer when the first thing you read on a rulebook is the setup.

First play was 2-3 rounds with only 2p...liked it well enough. Second attempt was playing a 4p game 2 months later...rough! 5.5 hours later we were complete. I'm keeping an 8 because I think there's plenty here to like and this particular playing was anomaly. There are a few rules clarification we need to button up before next play though. There seem to be some very odd anti-thematic implementations, but overall, it seems solid. For sure 8 if it can be played in 2-2.5. Most likely drops to 7 if always 3+ hours.

Not the hit I hoped it would be.  After loving Anachrony, I tracked down this earlier release by Mindclash Games.  There's some cool stuff here.  The different action allowances on each worker is a cool mechanic.  I also liked the blind location selection. The art is fantastic, and very evocative of the setting.  Actual game play fell oddly flat for my group.  Perhaps it's that the build up to putting on a magic show at the end of the week felt so anti-climactic...it's just laying a tile on a card, in the end.  I don't know, but none of us has the urge to dig and dig at Trickerion when there are other games out that we like a lot more.

initial rating..7..ish? But it was actually really good, just with sooo many moving parts and weird rules and exceptions (when it comes to the theatre part). It could be really great if a developer/publisher took it and made a second edition, but until then we have something that may not be a perfect jewel but instead a beautiful frankenstein, stumbling along on crooked legs. But with all the parts that makes up that monster, stitched together in a lab somewhere, it is impressive that it stands, let alone walks without falling.

I was afraid because some KS projects offer nice drawings and an excess of expansions, and lately they are overproduced and of little interest. Anyway, after a first game to Trickerion, I think that this is an interesting one, not the typical abstract eurogame, but a very immersive experience. Probably the Dark Alley expansion makes it too long, but it can be good for experienced players.

This game would be a 7 or 7.5 (for the moment), but I rate it 8 due to the artwork, and because the expansions are included.

This game is great but it really needs to or three people familiar with releasing big hits to go over the rules, mechanics, etc, and polish it.  This should be a rather simple worker placement game, but the rules make it unnecessarily clunky, and  the designer might have thrown in one or two  too many mechanics that really don't benefit the overall game.  The rulebook took too long to comprehend, there are people playing the game wrong (after reading several threads), many of the play through videos play one or more rules completely wrong, and even though I think our first game we avoided any real glaring rule mistakes, I can't help but think we didn't play everything correct (and I am talking about two of us being play testers and demo for several companies at conventions).  I still really like the game but I wouldn't be shocked when people in the future don't want to play the game.  After two attempts I know think I can teach the game cold.  However, if I don't play it within a month I will not be able to teach the game correct at all because there is just too many fiddly things.  If they just streamlined a few things this game could be a grail game.

遊戲是以工人放置的方式進行，但開始安排角色放置場所的行動是隱藏的，換句話說，遊戲進行的策略容錯率會因安排的位置而大減，所幸遊戲中對於分數落後的玩家有著非常補償的機制，甚至說玩家可以刻意的壓分，以得到順位前面的優勢，這樣的平衡機制以一款策略遊戲對我來說是非常有吸引力的，讓每個玩家都有機會衝分。
遊戲中玩家操作的不外乎三個要素，行動、金錢、魔法石，再來就是搶位置，位置場所分成四個，版圖上的城區、市場及戲院是每個玩家都必需搶位，個人工作室是準備魔術的地方，遊戲的帶入感以及邏輯主題非常相符，進行的過程中有合作也有卡位，即使第一次跑的是基本遊戲，也讓我相當喜歡。

A solid mix of well-known Euro mechanisms like simultaneous action selection, worker placement, acquiring special skills and resource conversion to put on shows. Think Fresco, Pillars of the Earth, Drum Roll. The novel part are the magicians' tricks which can be chosen from a spellbook.

Trickerion is long and slow at times, challenging players' concentration. Three players is probably the sweet spot between enough competition and reasonable playtime. I like that decisions matter. Minor mistakes can be made early on but too many of those and a player will trail the pack for the rest of the game. There are no random or direct player targeting elements that often mar first efforts from new publishers in their aim to be thematic or innovative. The artwork is very attractive although functionality suffers a bit until players are familiar with the procedures.

Nonetheless, a few kinks reveal the inexperienced publisher. There are a few strategic musts like getting new assistants and a second trick as early as possible. The story arc doesn't work out as intended. The level 3 tricks are so expensive and difficult to get that in my opinion they would need a higher payout. As it is, a strong level 2 trick performed repeatedly will be a more efficient VP source. In effect, the key innovation of the spellbook falls short. Also, the last two turns are anti-climactic as players will only be concerned with putting on shows with whatever they got at that time.

The overall positive impression was hurt further by a gamey omission in the rules that got resolved in the final version. Instead of placing new tricks into the theater, it was far easier and potentially yielded more VPs to save the preparation time for new tricks, choose the early starting date in the theater (giving one more action point) and simply move tricks back and forth between theaters to create links. Luckily, this is changed in the final version.

Very lovely, very thematic, very heavy. Definitely best with the full four players, but a hazard for the AP prone, especially if Dark Alley and Magician Powers are added in. I think the game really needs Dark Alley, but I'm a little wary of adding yet another layer in in the form of the power cards. Worker placement is far from my favorite mechanic, and the weight of this is going to keep my desire-to-play rating down. For those who like worker placement, it's a good, generally clean design with a lot going on but probably doesn't represent any major advance in the category.

2/4/17: Bumping up to an 8 (from 7) after a 2p game with Dark Alley. Still haven't played with Magician Powers, though.

Very Very difficult to mount your tricks successfully and in a meaningful way at the theatre - but fun getting to that point!! A bit complex when scoring tricks and so much to think about.

Right out of the box a perfect game.

Way to much in this game for the type of mechanisms used.  The secret worker placement does not fit the level of planning needed.  The puzzle placement of tricks for a performance is also overkill that drives this game to dry over thinker where no one gets what they want.
It really needs a bit of experienced development to get it tuned.

Trickerion: Ambientado en el siglo 19 donde los espectáculos de magia con tendencia súper natural tenían gran acogida. El objetivo ser el mago con mayor prestigio. Hay que empezar por decir que el juego visualmente es impecable, absolutamente fantástico. 
Es un Euro competitivo donde se combinan mecánicas como programación de acciones de manera
simultánea + la colocación de trabajadores para lograr las mejores posiciones en el tablero. De mecánicas sencillas, pero para afinar una buena estrategia hay que PENSAR.
Quizás ese punto lo hace un juego "lento" ojo no tiene que ver con la duración (3 horas) lo cual puede bajar cuando la curva de aprendizaje sea mejor.
Tampoco estoy diciendo que tenga Downtime ya que exige estar atento de las movidas de los demás magos. Solo es eso que su desarrollo por momento se puede tornar lento por el tema de planificación + ejecución. 

Ya en lo personal el juego me gusto bastante y queda el reto César Quintero de jugarlo con la expansión ya que le añade unos ingredientes extras entre ellos 2 semanas de juego más lo cual seguro permitirá tener desarrollados más actos de magia.

Nota: Es un juego que exige ser muy selectivo con el grupo con el que se vaya a jugar "los buenos vinos no son para todo el mundo"

Great background story and nice graphic novelly looks combine with relatively straightforward worker placement system with a neat planning phase. You can use your workers to get bonuses for your other functions, or get resources, or turn resources into fame (=vp) in a three phase process. My sole play saw me getting a second trick and all the required resources on the first turn and after that just spending the last four turns grinding that three phase process. It was enough for a narrow victory against others going for grander combinations. The game comes with an expansion in the box adding a bit complexity and two more turns. I think that that is how this is supposed to be played, but I'm not fond of the idea of an extra hour of play time. Negative points for encouraging turtling with very annoying beat the leader mechanisms in advertising costs and Thursday showtime.

Don't get fooled by designer's statement that base game is Stone Age level! Base game without expansions is a lot more meaty than Family version of Agricola!

Initial enthusiastic rating after fist 7 hour experience (incl. explanation). Rulebook is quite horrid, there're tons of ambiguities and unexplained details. Learning curve of the first game with all expansions is crazy, but oh boy, what a fun this was! There's nearly no downtime, so many things to think of constantly!

Possibly an instant classic. More games required. Would benefit greatly from a better rulebook.

2015-10-13 - 8.5 - A gorgeous looking, quite heavy euro game with a very cool theme which really comes through the mechanics. That is the best premiere game of Spiel 2015 for me.

2016-01-22 - 8.5->8 - I have played it 3 times now (base game) and it is really good but I hesitate to put it on the table again and rather choose something else. Is it too heavy/time consuming? I'll see.

2016-08-16 - 8->7 - It never hits the table and when I considered it I always thought - better play something else. I would probably have fun, but I guess it's too long, has too long setup and it's too exhausting to explain for me to bring it to the table.

2018-02-24 - 7->6 - That's one of the biggest drops for me. I have played 4 player game with Dark Alley and Magician Powers and it took us twice as long as I would like to. We played for about 4 hours, but I had enough after two. I don't want to play Magician Powers ever again as they give those overcomplicated little abilities, which can give us smaller or bigger bonuses but it is almost impossible to control who can do what and you stop keeping track of it after a short while. Someone says he made something because of the power and you just say, yeah, whatever. I don't want to play this game with 4 players ever again with Dark Alley or maybe at all with this number.  
The market takes important place in the game but this spot is just boring and unexciting. 
Dark Alley is probably fun, but choosing action cards causes a huge AP and there is quite a lot of moments in this game, when AP is present (putting trick markers on the shows, choosing tricks, choosing magician powers cards).

I guess I would enjoy the most just the base game with 3 players, maybe with Dark Alley, but I would choose for example Tzolk'in over this one anytime. And I would be able to finish Marco Polo after that, while the game of Trickerion would still be going.

The game is just too long. Twice too long. And it's way too much.

OMG the theme on this one!! I LOVE Prestige and I couldn't get them to take my money fast enough. I'm really big into WP games lately and I think this one will take the cake on theme (behind Fury of Dracula) for me and, though it is heavy, I can see this hitting the table with my SO and me with the ramped 2-player rules.

I love this game, but teaching this to new players can be a pain. The mechanics are simple but the symbols always seem to be overwhelming to new players. Not once have I not taught this, where the new player didn't act or look overwhelmed. But once everyone knows how to play, it is a great worker placement game.

A solid game about being an aspiring 19th century magician looking to perform the most awe-inspiring tricks and amass the most fame. Mechanically it's a hybrid worker-placement and action selection game that has a bit of other unique mechanisms in it. Really liked this one.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

First play was quite engaging and we played the full game with Dark Alleys and magician powers. This is pretty simple worker placement - the challenge comes in having different strength workers and fighting for the right to place your workers where you can gain additional action points to take the necessary actions at the different locations. This game is quite thematic and quite beautiful in the presentation. There is a good bit of text on the cards, particularly with the expansions/variants. Be aware that one can get cancelled out of an action if there are more workers than players than have a card for the location but at least then you don't have to pay the worker! ;-) Expect learning games to take a fair bit of time. With three new players, this learning game with rules took us 4 hours. The trick building is quite fascinating and ideally you want to plan well ahead - particularly since the level 3 tricks also grant an additional end game bonus if you can satisfy the condition.

Trickerion is a phenomenal game. It’s huge. No really, it’s physically huge. You’re gonna need one hell of a table (or living room floor) to play this game. It’s complex. The most complex game I’ve played to date. It’s hard. It hurts my brain and then laughs at me for doing so. It’s a game that makes me curse, laugh and cheer but not always in that order. It’s a game that I’ve only played over 10 times and hardly scratched the surface of.

In Trickerion: Legends of Illusion players are illusionists trying to earn fame by performing grand magic shows in a fictional place called Magoria. The best illusionist will earn the Trickerion stone and succeed master illusionist Dahlgaard. The game has multiple difficulty levels. There’s the base game, which is quite hard. Then on the other side of the board there is the advanced game (with the Dark Alley expansion) which is even harder. People who didn’t back the game on kickstarter can also get the add-on with two new modules that increase the difficulty and variability of the game even further. The goal of the game is so simple. You acquire tricks, you buy equipment so that you can perform them after which you prepare the tricks in your workshop and plan a performance. It sounds like a simple worker placement. But if you add the simultaneous action selection, action point allowance mechanism, tile placement and a hint of programming , hidden information and dice selection……. That’s just a lot to take in. It is a lot to explain for that matter, which is why it is hard to get to the table. I am so glad my wife, who doesn’t tend to like heavy games, did enjoy this one because of its great theme. Because I want to play this again and again.

Played once (beginner game). Original theme. But it feels like they crammed a few too many mechanisms into a single game. Especially the puzzling with linking up spell markers in the theaters is hard - I felt like we spent way too much time on that aspect of the game where it should have been minor.
Also with so few workers and so few rounds, it's really hard to get to the bigger tricks. (Ok, that should be a bit easier in the full game, but still far from simple.)
In the end, the time spent / fun had ratio isn't good enough for me.

Bought on BGG Market.

First played at meetup with Will 12/11/15.

Magician theme was an instant hit.  You can tell that the mechanics were really driven by the theme.  There was a good bit of tension leading up to the final turns, and the strategies are varied.

The only problems are that there are so many moving parts that it may be difficult to teach.  GF didn't have major problems, but I see this being an AP prone game.  Our group of four (3x newbies) finished in under 2 hours.  Another who played the same day took 3 - 4 hours.

Didn't get much use out of magician powers or power cards.  Might have been due to unfamiliarity on first play.

Setting up for performances was one of the bigger breaks in theme.  It felt very "gamey" having to determine how to arrange my trick tokens for the best bonuses.

Great theme for a game and nice components of a bit busy looking to begin with.  A lot to like about it - keen to play again.  Lots of interacting pieces.  The blind action selection, bonus for going to an area early, tension in deciding what the key things to grab in a given round.  Doesn’t really lend itself to casual play though.

In college my roommate and I got into magic tricks, er illusions. We would go around campus showing our magic. Then I saw the Kickstarter for this game and it was an instaback. I didn’t know what I was getting into but it looked awesome. When it came I played it with my gaming group and it was a winner. However I tried reaching this game to my then fiancé and she was brand new to gaming and it was so heavy it left a sour taste in her mouth. It’s now a joke to recommend playing this game with her even 1.5 years later, but I have her on record saying she would try it out again sometime in the future. #2018Resolution

The theme is there and you feel it when you play.  After 3 plays with none of the expansions, it still feels more like work than play.  I had higher hopes.  Perhaps trying an expansion might help.

One thing I don't like is that each spellbook is fully open at the start allowing for too many choices.  I would have preferred a narrower range of choices in order to make the game more fluid and less about long-term planning.

I love this game, but I acknowledge that it has significant problems.

The game starts with a period of quiet silence as people trying to work out a collection of tricks that they can support with a sensible number of materials. Then somebody takes "your" trick and you have to silently sit and replan. I think another round of playtesting would have pared back the number of materials and maybe added some flexibility to trick requirements.

Maybe an expansion can take this from very good to excellent.

One of the first heavy euro games I've ever played and I immediately fell in love. So proud to own this game. The manual is a bit daunting due to length but really its a lot of story and pictures and the base game is not very difficult. Also the game is modular. The longer game introduces "The Dark Alley" offer more mysticism into the theme. Oh man is the dark alley good, i will never play the short side again. The component quality of the game is top notch. My only gripe with the game is the extensive set up (my meeple realty insert helped alleviate that), the game can be a bit much to teach, and the game is a table. I love this game and I'm always down to play if i do not have to teach it. If i do i will still most likely play.

Pre-selecting your workers' destinations means little hope for backup plans leading to linear strategies that set up players to race for the same objectives (disappointing for those involved, convenient for those not). The tightness of energy and limited use of shards creates un-fun constraint on activities. The spatial puzzle of trick performance is ridiculous and leads to intentional and unintentional beneficial side effect. Performing tricks is almost always better than setting yourself up for others. Tradeoffs rarely result in interesting decisions. An exercise in frustration, not fun.

Nagyon jó euro game, témájában és kivitelezésében is csillagos ötös. A mechanikák egymásra épülése miatt viszont már túl tömény, és van egy olyan érzése az embernek, hogy túl gyorsan ér véget, pont mire már belejönnél.

Ha csak kicsit lenne könnyedebb, gördülékenyebb, kaphatna magasabb pontot is.

Ettől függetlenül baromi jó, jó úton halad, hogy igazi klasszikus váljon belőle.

Első KS-es vásárlásom, de annyi jó előzetes beszámolót lehetett róla olvasni, hogy félelem nélkül ugrottam bele. Egyelőre azt kell mondanom, nem is bántam meg, tetszik a játék, a grafikai megvalósítása gyönyörű, a komponensek jók (bár azért a bűvész figura szebb lett volna a KS-es képen látható kúp alakú alsó résszel.)
Nagyon szépen ötvözi a munkáslehelyezős mechanikát az akciópontossal, mindezt egy kis előreprogramozással megfűszerezve! A kör elején mindenki a bűvészéhez és a segédeihez lerakhatja a négy helyszín egy-egy kártyáját, képpel lefelé. Az embereinket a lerakás fázisban csak a kártya által meghatározott helyre küldhetjük, az egyetlen lehetőségünk, hogy nem hajtjuk végre a bábú lehelyezését - ezzel pénzt spórolva.
Minden embernek van egy alap akciópontja (bűvésznek 3, specialistáknak 2, a segédeknek 1), ehhez adódik hozzá a helyszínek akciópontja amelyek +2-tól -1-ig terjedhet - tehát csökkenhet is az alap. Az akciópontok erejéig bármennyi akciót végrehajthatunk a helyszínen, vásárlás például 1, tehát akár 4 vásárlás is lehetséges egy körben. A trükkök vásárlása 3 akciópont, ami elég sok, nagyon ügyesen kell tervezni, hogy legyen elég, mire odaér a figuránk!
A játék másik szép része a trükkök előadása: nagyon ügyes mechanika alapján a trükköket láncba fűzhetjük, mintha egy szép, folyamatos előadást látnánk a színházban az össze-vissza trükkök egymásutánisága helyett. Ha sikerül láncokba fűzni a mutatványokat, sok pluszpontot kaphatunk, amire érdemes szem előtt tartani!

A játék nagyon feszült, végig figyelni kell sok mindenre, de ha összeáll, nagyon élvezetes lehet. Legalábbis nekem az!

Whether the game just isn't my cup of tea or whether it does two things that I don't enjoy in gameplay, I'm not sure but I need to play it again to find out.
Firstly I have a problem with games that are just rounds of wash-rinse-repeat with little change to either the mechanics or options.
Secondly I have a problem with games with downtime between turns.
Whether I have completely missed the challenge and excitement of the building tension in the game and/or the downtime is related to the first play only more plays will answer.

Bloated Euro-fest which drowns it's single good achievement of having a reasonably flexible WP-core mechanic with loads of unnecessary fiddlines and tacked-on mechanics that can only be explained by the inexperience behind the first-time designer attempting to shove "more game" into the box.

The theme is completely superfluous and pasted-on. This game is as much about stage magicians as it is about automobile manufacturing for all the sense it makes. Avoid unless you are an Euro-fan looking for a bloated mechanical exercise that never seems to end or make any sort of sense.

PROs: Excellent strategy game! You really need to plan and if you do that well, you can shine. The theme is very well tied into the mechanics. 

CONs: Dully and dreary artwork with limited color palette which is to look at for long periods of time. This is horrible, because the game is WAY too long for what it is. It really overstayed its welcome with me. And the colors are so similar that I missed a critical icon and broke rules. The rules are way too complicated for what it is and what you get out of it. Likely never playing this game again and would certainly never recommend it to anyone that wanted to have fun. I'd rather play something with excellent strategic choices AND was fun - not just strategic.

This game looks amazing on the table, but it is a heavy game...so be prepared to put some time into it.  The game is interesting throughout, but I wish the actual gameplay was as magical as the theme suggests.  That simply doesn't play out as hoped.  So it stays strickly a deep, thinky strategy game with lots of variables in the form of dice rolls, cards, and "fate" effects if you play the Dark Alley.  Main mechanisms are money management, action selection, resource/hand management, among other mechanisms.

Hard to judge.
I've played only one basic game. It was way too long and not so exciting.
On the other side most rules are quite simple and easy to learn.
I need more play to give a proper rating. For now it's 6.

Fantastico gioco strategico con materiali, grafica e ambientazione superlativi. Il gioco offre due scenari differenti, il primo semplificato e il secondo completo con l'aggiunta della Dark Alley e tante altre piccole aggiunte. Il primo scenario è addirittura indipendente dalla lingua mentre lo scenario completo rende il gioco drasticamente più complesso ma anche più gratificante. Nel gioco interpretiamo illusionisti alle prese con degli spettacoli di magia che andranno in scena ogni fine settimana. I trucchi da presentare vanno imparati, provati, completati con i materiali opportuni e presentati con i giusti assistenti per rendere lo spettacolo degno di nota e quindi prestigi, soldi ecc. Nel complesso siamo di fronte ad un gioco di programmazione molto articolato e che necessita di diverse partite per essere padroneggiato. A mio avviso una delle grandi uscite del 2015.

[b]Trickerion: Legends of Illusion[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I've only gotten to play this one more time and it was a 4p game with all the modules again. My second play was just as good as my first, this is one of the best truly heavy games I've played. Even though there is a lot to take in and plan for everything you do makes sense thematically so planning out your moves ahead feels very intuitive. Trickerion is an excellent game that I would still highly recommend if you enjoy complex, brain burners. I've had other opportunities to play, but the time commitment has kept me from playing, usually I prefer to play a few quicker/lighter games than something this long and heavy unless it's a war game. If you enjoy heavy games with a lot of player agency and freedom I don't think you can do much better than Trickerion. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Many will argue over theme/no theme, but the artwork draws you in and creates a rich atmosphere that surrounds the game and really draws you in.
- What an awesome and unique choice for a heavy Euro game, even the mechanics of the game help draw you in and dovetail nicely with the theme.
- This is a heavy Euro that will take multiple plays to unpack everything that is going on, that said even your first play will be a fun ride.
- Once you play with all the modules this game does a great job creating a unique play experience for each player, it's a pleasure to play an asymmetric Euro especially since it's not a common occurrence.
- I played a 2p game and it was a great experience, the game scales extremely well.

I am really looking forward to playing this again, but it is definitely a brain burn so it's not a game I want to play every day. What impressed me the most is how smooth the game plays given the complexity of the decisions you need to make, that speaks volumes about the ability of these folks to design a game since as far as I know this is their first design. Top notch game and one I'd wholeheartedly recommend if you enjoy heavy games.[/i]

I am a magician, so there's a theme here that I'm interested in.  There's a lot to keep track of in this game, and I know that I've only just scratched the surface.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy my losses, simply because I "know" these tricks.  I "know" how cool it would be to see these shows.  Basically, this is one of the few games that I own where I can easily slip into the theme and mentally envision it all happening.  Fun!

A confounding, unforgiving game in which errors in calculation can ruin an entire turn of 7 turns.  Much like Caylus in: "must plan out entire turn and anticipate what others are going to do, else I am in trouble..."  Only AP-types will like.

RATING: 6
This is a game that I've been very excited to play since I saw it on Kickstarter last year. It was mostly the theme of Victorian-age magicians performing tricks that got me interested. But then I discovered the game had simultaneous secret deployment for your workforce. Then it had the sneaky Dark Alley where small game-breaking prophecies were fulfilled. Then there was alternate art for the specialists, and Special Assignments cards which were power-ups to your basic actions. All of this made me believe that the game was not basic worker placement; it felt like an immersive, thematic experience! And I was right. From having to pay workers for their assistance to preparing and setting up tricks backstage, every element of the game works towards making Trickerion atmospheric and wonderful. While it was a very drawn out and clunky experience, it was definitely thrilling to play and never dull; my mind was constantly calculating the factors that might affect my strategy for the next turn. Prophecies, player powers, turn order, available action points, special assignments cards that might help me; it was almost too much to consider. For first time players, even experienced gamers, I would definitely recommend becoming familiar with the base game and how it flows before moving on to the expansions. While that might seem underwhelming at first, believe me, you'll go dizzy from the intricacies of all of the elements spinning at once. And there wasn't a ton of help from the rulebook about those weird instances of rules and special assignment cards/powers colliding, so we communally voted on the effect (an appendix and errata might help from Mindclash). Anyways, Trickerion was a blast to play, if a bit fiddly and overcomplicated for its own good. Easy to pick up and play? Certainly not. But the theme is so unique and different that it makes people push past their confusion with the game and untie the knot of Trickerion. Super-thematic and immersive with a steep learning curve for even experience gamers, I still can't wait to play Trickerion again!

Lost for words ...an almost perfect KS ...stunning game and a new bench mark set for a KS projects...it can be done and to all those not so hot games publishers ...this is the level that you should aspire to...great customer support and the game is just absolutely wonderful ...great subject too...

We played several times over Christmas holidays and enjoyed every minute of this game ...deep thinking was required in order to perform the best shows...but boy what a journey ...one of the best WP games I have played and using the optional 2p rules made this a seriously good 2 player game. No need for dummy/robo  players etc ...very impressive design...not played with the magicians duel yet ...

As soon as you have learnt basic game ...I would highly recommend getting the dark alley aspect of the game going it's adds so much to the game with hardly any new rules ...

Based on one play: We played with the Dark Alley expansion and that was a bad idea. It just adds a lot of length and options that others can be effected by but cannot control including a few very strange ones. The game is nice looking, the cards have nice artwork, but the board is way too busy and it seems like a few games merged together. Can't say I was a fan.

Trickerion is a involved programmed-action worker placement game.  Players pre-determine where their workers (each of whom has different strengths/abilities) is going to go, and then sequentially place those workers, trying to claim the best spots in each of those areas before an opponent takes them.  In this way, players can acquire trick cards and the materials necessary to perform them, set-up the tricks, put them into a performance, and finally put on a performance, which earns points and money for all tricks involved.  The game also provides an option "Dark Alley" module, which provides play-to-play variety to an otherwise largely deterministic game.  I really enjoyed the planning elements involved in the multi-step trick performance performance procedure, as well as the provided "menu" of tricks to help plan out the trick progression.  The worker placement and performance mechanic provided just the right amount of player interaction.  However, I wish the beginning and intermediate tricks had more variety in terms of their rewards, I'm not convinced the end-game bonus tricks are balanced, and I don't like the "get there first" nature of obtaining trick cards.  That said, this was a very good game that I'd be happy to play more.

I was worried about this one. My geekbuddies seem rather split on it, but after a few plays including the Dark Alley expansion, I can say that this game is rather fun. It has a lot to think about and getting and preparing your tricks each turn lead to some rather interesting decisions. Do you work your way down to high level spells in one class or branch off and aim for link bonuses? Not as heavy as BGG makes it (I'd put it in medium, maybe medium heavy).

This game has potential to rise. After my first 2 games, I've been thinking about it nonstop. Looking forward to trying out some of the other magicians as well as the special deck of cards to further change how the game is played.

I really like how the start of a game can be rather variable. Which specialist to take, which spell(s) to start with, which components? If it was such a static start, I feel like this game would just be okay. With the variable start, this game is magnificent. I really feel like I can sculpt what I'm planning on doing. This game is rising with each play.

Edit: Couple of easy to miss rules:
1. Only 1x shard use per guy you play.
2. You can pay money to make up the difference of fame for learning tricks other cards.
3. Tricks stay on the theater cards until performed or until it slides off the row.
4. The managers +1 component bonus counts as part of the limit to the number of goods.

An interesting worker placement game. The conclusion was sort of anti-climactic and it's really easy to miss a rule that can change everything. Also, splitting up action points can become an exercise in paying really close attention to everyone's moves so they don't accidentally cheat.

That said, the visual design and production is beautiful and the game is packed full of theme. On the mechanics side it's good, but the second and third tier spells should probably be cheaper or pay out better. Easy to milk one or two tricks for a winning quantity of VPs.

Wow, it rarely happens that I have to read the rules twice before understanding everything. But even then, I could explain all things apart, but it's not that evident to see how it all works together.

Played only the base game. From one side I'm very glad to not already throw in all the stuff from the inspansion 'The Dark Alley', as most of us were already struggling to find there way. On the otherside, 5 rounds is a bit short. For instance: I won our game, but never invested in 16-fame tricks, as it just consumes far too much actions with a not so better yield.

I've come to really love Trickerion. Instead of growing stale like most games, it feels fresh every time I play. The theme is incredibly immersive and the stress of choosing your opening strategy is awesome and intense. If you're unfamiliar with the game, at the start of play you're allowed to pick your first assistant. You have three options and each class (manager/assistant/engineer) has a start of game only special ability. Pair this with the class of magician you have and the starting tricks you can accomplish and you find that you are only 5 minutes in and things are getting thick in a hurry. The one downside to the game is the setup time. I'm looking to rectify the situation by getting the custom insert. Really, the only reason the game doesn't come out all the time is due to getting it sorted out on the table. We left it set up in the house at one point and played it 5/6 times. The rule book is a pleasure to read and is available online. The game is far superior to Anachrony, Mindclash's other game. Component wise, it would have been nice if the player boards were on thick cardboard like the wonders in 7wonders. The game is nowhere near as big a table eater as some older video reviews stated - through the development cycle, many items were refined for space efficiency. The action selection and subsequent turn based reveal are fantastic as are the ability to use action points to adjust different placement areas. Outside of doing a teaching game, the 2 player game should include all the expansions - absolutely incredible and you can tell that its how the game was meant to be played.

RATING: 1
This game has the depth of a light to medium euro, but with none of the refinement. The pointless overcomplication leads to massive downtime between turns. The game asks you to make a lot of potentially game ruining decisions during setup as to your spells, faction and starting assistant. The character abilities are drastically different in their usefulness. The game also has just a little card flip and die rolling luck, but what there is can create  unrecoverable problems for you. 

Some specific problems: all actions in the game you can take multiple times except for the action that banks tricks. Each time a trick card has a trick banked you can't make that trick again until the card it spent. This simply makes no sense with the rest of the design. The symbol matching mini game you play when staging the trick adds a lot of time for meager rewards and you don't have much if any ability to control the payout. The catchup mechanism to the game is spending a dollar at the start of the game to get 2 points. This makes no sense as if you prob have run aground on dollars if you need catchup. This problem is compounded by the way to collect dollars is to spend 3 actions, which means you are usually making the choice between getting dollars or scoring anything in the round, since both require your post powerful worker or for the stars to align and other players make bad decisions. This leads to the poor getting poorer.

The game also gives you this big list of tricks and sort of demands you plan a route through them where you use as many of the similar requirements. This ads a ton of time to the game, flipping through the pages and looking for efficient resource linkages, but in reality the luck of the dice prevents you from buying any trick outside your starting card tree.

In terms of components, the tokens and the art on the board are decent but the portraits of the characters are really amateurish.

No szóval. -1 pont, mert a készítők nem csináltak hozzá magyar szabályt! Értem én, hogy angolul jobb, egyszerűbb, gyorsabb és ez rendben is van, ettől függetlenül magyar játéknak magyar szabályt is kellett volna csinálni. 
De a játékról kicsit kritikusabban: Először is a játék gyönyörű, a legszebb amit láttam  eddig, a minőség is teljesen megfelelő. Viszont játék közben olyan sok és pasztell/egy hatású szín van a táblán és mellette, hogy gyakorlatilag élvezhetetlen a szép látvány. Azt látom, hogy nem "játszó" ember tervezte.
Az alapjátékkal játszottunk és nagyon megrémültem az elején, mert egy kimerítő nap után full káosz uralkodott a fejemben. Játék közben, már az első fordulóban eloszlottak a félelmeim, teljesen letisztult és már máshol tapasztalt játékmechanikák köszöntek be. Függetlenül az ismert játékelemektől, jól gyúrták össze és hozzátettek egy kis pluszt is. Szóval ez rendben is van. Izgalmas volt és kellemes feszültség is volt a játékban. 
Én nagyon büszke lennék, ha ilyen szép és jó játékot tennék le az asztalra. Egyszóval(kettővel): LEA KALAPPAL!!:)

RATING: 6
Something is not right with this game. On the outside, it looks amazing: the theme, the art, the mechanics - all seems to click. But then, when you play it, some critical flaws come to light. The basic mode feels too simple, yet adding all the expansions (Dark Alleys, Magician Powers) makes the game an unbalanced slog. Too many cards, too much text, AP starts to kick in and the downtime is considerable. Getting good magician powers combo will give you an advantage and the necessity  of reading Dark Allyes card pretty much every turn (which are tiny, and the game sprawling) is tiring. 

If I'd have to point the reason, I would say the game is underdeveloped. I think it would be much better for the designers to focus on a single mode, balance it more and streamline a bit. It feels like they wanted to give players too many options and in result, it's hard to say which version of the game is the best. Also, playing with AP-prone players is a pain, which often stops me from experiencing this game. There is a lot of good hidden here, only it's not polished enough.

[u]The positive:[/u]
(+) Beautiful and stylish game which breathes atmosphere

(+) Worker placement with secret deployment and a refreshing action point system which works splendidly

(+) Nice opportunities for some interesting player interaction (possible mutual wins, or possibly subtle but very meaningful harm) during performances.

(+) Many different ways to approach the game: All players get different special abilities (2 different types to choose from per player, so 8 possibilities in total), special assignment cards will favor tactical play, the fate tiles might impact certain decisions each round. Players can choose to mainly perform themselves, or try to influence the rest and get by doing guest performances, ...

(+) The game just keeps spawning interesting tactical opportunities each turn.

(+) The game really grows. Your workshops grow bigger, you get more and more powerful staff, your tricks improve significantly and there are certain fame tresholds which unlock different magician powers and more advanced tricks. This is a really neat aspect of the game!

(+) Players get drawn in into the theme while performing their actions, and despite the long playing time (with some downtime issues), the game keeps all players involved and time flies by ('[i]oh, is it 2 a.m. already??![/i]').


[u]The negative:[/u]
(-) Special assignment cards are really cool, but also a *huge* pain. It are small cards full of small text and they change constantly. Imagine a huge boardgame in which players sit at opposite corners of the table and you understand why at least 2 out of 4 players will after a while simply give up reading those small cards upside down at the far corner of the table. These cards also add a certain amount of chaos to the game: after a while you don't know which player had what type of special ability using special assignment cards. Should the authors be willing to read it: my suggestion would be to greatly simplify these cards and only add three types of cards in each deck (downtown, market, workshop and theater). That way not each card would be something new each time and players would be able to utilize these cards much better. It would also decrease the (extremely long) gametime considerably by cutting away downtime.

(-) The game tends to drag a little when people try to read the text on special assignment cards available in the dark alley, or look up the meaning of the (many and unnumbered - [i]why didn't they put a number on them?![/i]) fortune tiles. Calculating the scores during performances also takes a while and could feel pretty fiddly (modifiers could apply to tricks, not link bonuses or performance card bonusses, sometimes fate tiles also change which modifiers apply to which players etc etc). Luckily the end result really is an interesting way of scoring points during performances with some real clever player interaction possibilties, so for this downtime I'm (partly) forgiving.

(-) It didn't happen in our games yet, but I can imagine a kingmaker effect during the final performance phase being some cause for concern.

(-) Some luck dependence in dice rolls on the downtown area, card draws with special assignment cards and a certain amount of chaos induced with the fate tiles which can change too quickly and impact the game very much. I would suggest leaving out the fate tiles and maybe even the special abilities of the magicians in order to create a better flowing and less chaotic experience. It would reduce the game time while offering more or less the same amount of interesting decision making.

(-) [Minor complaint] Resource tiles run low in 4-p games. As they are supposed to be unlimited, it is a shame they didn't include more.

(-) [Minor complaint] The manual is beautifully stylized, but it lacks small clarifying examples which would aid a big deal in learning the game. Some rule unclarities remain.

(-) [Minor complaint] Table space could be an issue. Our table barely fits the game. On the other hand, I like the look of really big games, so I don't mind. If you don't have at least a 6 person dining table, forget about playing a 4-player game of Trickerion.

(-) [Minor complaint] Explaning the game to new players takes a lot of time. However, it is helpful that most rules are grounded in theme, this greatly helps players to understand the game.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
First of, I will say: don't just count the number of + points and compare that to the number of - points! The positive clearly outweighs the negative in case of Trickerion here!

Trickerion clearly is a debut title of the authors who have brought this game into the world via a Kickstarter campagn. While playing this beautiful game, you can see and feel the love invested into this game! However, having skipped the step of a critical evaluation by an established publisher, this finished product seems to have some 'unpolished' features left. The manual doesn't clarify everything, some mechanics bring disproportional downtime in the game, and certain small oversights make life on the players a little harder (like: not putting numbers on fate tiles, making the player boards so large they won't fit on a somewhat smaller table, including a bunch of unique special assignment cards which change constantly so at least half of the players will give up on keeping track, ...).

Such problems would usually lead me to put off a game as being an unfinished piece of trash, but this is certainly not the case with Trickerion! This has two reasons:

1. The game lures new players in. Sure, they will need to survive a long and demanding explanation, starting a cozy game evening at the far corners of a big table and getting confused for the first few rounds with small cards, unclear fate tiles and getting lost in a rather impractical player aid booklet containing a ton of tricks. However, despite all this, the theme will draw them in, and the fact that the decisions they make are thematically grounded because you can relate to the magician the game simulates you to be. It also helps that this game looks fantastic.

2. The game keeps all players involved from start to finish. Objectivly spoken, downtime is a real issue here and the game takes longer than it should (when you play it with all expansions) - however, it keeps growing (your tricks improve, you get more actions, you get more possibilities in tricks to learn and abilities to persue) and each decision offered really matters. Time flies by.

People from my game group say they think Trickerion is the best game released in 2015. I understand why they are saying this: it is a daring title which didn't bother making compromises which could have risked making it a flat title like any other issued by an established publisher and it is easy to fall in love with its theme and involved mechanics. I don't agree with them that this is the best game of 2015 due to some 'rough' elements which have remained in the finished product, but I do feel like this is a fantastic game of which I'm sure it will hit the table and bring a jolly good time, time and time again!
 
[u]Game time:[/u]
Approx game time (including the dark alley expansion): 50-70 min / player (depending on experience level - but without explaining the game which takes a long time too)

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Money can be tight, especially at the beginning of the game. Make sure you invest in tricks generating lots of money should you decide to get some additional staff early in the game
(*) Try to read your opponents: will they perform or won't they? If they perform, what will be their best options? It is important to know this in order to maximize your chances of creating links when installing your tricks and getting guest performances. Invite players to create links in theaters where you would like to perform yourself
(*) Getting special assignment cards is powerful
(*) Try playing according to the personal strength of your magician and - if you are playing with the magician powers expansion - follow the strategic plan you set up at the start of the game.
(*) After all assignment cards are revealed: watch where all the others are going before placing your worker!
(*) At the start of the game: plan ahead which tricks you're aiming for during the game. Always think of a plan B should other players snatch away those tricks before you can. Plan according to matching resource requirements and interesting trick yields (not all money, at the end you mainly need points!). It is a big advantage if you get multiple trick tiles with one 'prepare trick' action!

RATING: 8.5
Trickerion has one of the best and most lush implementations of theme I've ever seen without giving away any of its strategic and tactical strength. This is a phenomenal game for immersive enjoyment. It's not quite perfect, to be fair; it requires a little more management then is ideal for modern games, and the theme of the actual performances is (surprisingly) the least interesting part of the whole. It's also just about an hour too long to see regular play, which is very unfortunate, since I find this to be one of my favorite combinations of thought and story. Overall, I just plain love this game, and I'd recommend it for medium-plus gamers who want to play with something beautiful which also rewards good play.

Trickerion最早是一个Kickstarter项目，当时就非常成功，所以其实曝光度已经很高，这次Essen对它来说已经是众多展会中的一站了，当然依然是最重要的一站。

Trickerion的美术风格让人过目不忘，维多利亚风的外包装，加上版图使用手绘感觉的Art Nouveau新艺术风格，立刻把你带到著名逃脱大师Houdini身边。生活在蒸汽火车轰隆隆前进的时代，人们似乎更愿意相信那舞台上魔术师表现的超现实，那时候的魔术不仅仅是娱乐。

你是位杰出的魔术师，和诸多Houdini一样，你要寻找和自己配合的各类人物：程师，助手，经理人等等一众，用最熟悉的工人放置机制来执行每个行动，探索整个19世纪末的城市，寻找你的伙伴还有相关表演需要的资源道具。最终排演惊人的一出出魔术，震撼这个天天处于大发展中的城市吧！

Over-stuffed with systems - one of which (the Theatre) is fiddly and over-clever at the same time - but this is a glorious heavier Euro with a decent smattering of theme (and more if you're prepared to put on the "shows" properly!) 
I'd be surprised if the game time ever came down to the projected 30m/player though, as interactions are quite sophisticated and it's far too easy to make mistakes.  It felt engaging all the way through however.  A definite Kickstarter hit for me.

stunningly bad game considering the average rating.  Who are all these people who are calling this a 'medium heavy' game?  This is a very simple game with few interesting choices.

Az eddigi legkomolyabb, legösszetettebb magyar társasjáték. A játékosok bűvészeket formáznak meg, akik trükköket tanulnak, segédeket alkalmaznak és előadásokat tartanak a játékban. A segédeket és a bűvészünket titkosan, előre kiválasztva, majd sorban helyezzük le a akcióhelyekre, amiből az alapjátékban 3 nagy hely van. Újabb alkalmazottak felvétele, új trükkök megtanulása és pénzszerzőhely az egyik, piac a másik, ahol a trükkökhöz szükséges alapanyagokat vehetjük meg és maga az előadóterem a harmadik helyszín, ahol mutatványainkat bemutathatjuk. Nekem új ötlet az egyes trükkök előkészítésének mivoltja, azaz különböző trükkökből különböző számút, különböző akciópontokért tudunk előkészíteni. Érdekes az előadások megtervezése, azaz a trükkök lehelyezése az egyes előadáskártyákra, amiért ha azonos típusú a trükk bónuszokat lehet kapni. A fix hatkörös játékban mindannyian érzetünk még javítanivalókat, de elsőre egyértelműen pozitív összképet kaptam. Kicsit még gyúrnak rajta lehet ebből egy nagyon jó kis játék. Mi csak az alappal játszottunk, de szerintem ez is bőven elég gondolkodós, nem érzem szükségességét tovább bonyolítani a kiegészítővel. Személy szerint nekem a grafikája a játéknak nem jött be, az ikonozás is lehetett volna nagyobb. Elsőre legyen egy ajándék 7 pont, aztán meglátjuk mi lesz a végleges kiadás.

After my first game, I thought this game was a deeply strategic and thematic, immersive, engaging masterpiece. I loved it, and I wanted to play more.

Since then, I've played a few more times. I still love it a lot, and I will continue to want to play more. I do think the performance aspect of going to the theater is a little clunky, and it takes me out of the game a bit (we have to look it up in the rules almost every time we play, just to be sure we're getting all the minutia correct). Other than that, though, I like this game a heck of a lot. It stays in the collection.

I'm not rating this game because I've only played it once and I didn't love so I don't want to mean to the poor thing. It's a beautiful game and I really wanted to like it but I was and remain put off by the theme. In the end, all you're doing is performing magic tricks. I mean, wow, I put on a show, hurrah? Just seems a lot of work to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Maybe I'm just a bad person or maybe another play (if I ever get one) will change my mind.

RATING: 8
Overall, I did quite enjoy this game and it gives you a lot to think about in planning a strategy (e.g. what tricks to plan for).  There are also some fun tactical moves like chaining the tricks and doing the performances.  I feel like it could have been streamlined a bit and not really lost any of that, for example the system for buying new goods is a bit fiddly as you are spending both action points and dollars and manipulating which goods are available next turn also, and oh yeah, you can spend more of each and get one item you need right now.  

I spent about an hour prepping for this game and I taught it to some friends who are willing gamers but not necessarily afficiannados...anyway, I am pretty sure I was testing their patience by the time I got through the explanation.  And that was just for the basic game, not the advanced version with the dark alley cards.  So, I recommend this but only for hardcore gamers.

I am giving this an 8 for gameplay.  I thought about bumping it down half a point for a little bit too much fiddliness but the art and visual design is so impressive that it cancels that out.

I don't know what to think about this game. It's somehow new because of the theme and also the way players get VP's but it's also a bit clumsy sometimes and the board, although interesting and very well merged with the theme, doesn't help me enough. Colors are not defined enough making the gameplay even more complex. But I think it's a game I want to play again which still is the best thing to say about it.

Only two games in, so no rating. A beautiful game that pushes the limits of the worker placement genre. Contrary to some, I felt that the theme was really coming through. We played two games without the Dark Alley. The potential for the game top be really long is my only worry.
There is often a question that I ask myself about those games. I feel like I make a plan, the execute it, and only hope that other players executing their own plans won't, by malchance, obstruct me too much. It's not that the game lacks interactions, it's just that those interactions are mostly involuntary (and sometimes voluntary) obstruction.

In any case, it was a very pleasant experience.

It's not a good sign when you feel overwhelmed while watching a Rahdo run-through. I had to type up a very rough player aid for our first game (Dark Alley, Duel of Magicians variant for 2p) just to feel confident enough to begin getting my head around it, but luckily it's a game where everything makes sense, once you've played it for awhile. (For us, "awhile" was 2-3 hours, which included breaks to Google for rule clarification and not-breaks for me to succumb more than the usual amount of Analysis Paralysis.) The components are all just gorgeous, and the theme is certainly fun. I especially appreciate the thought that went into the two-player version. I'm definitely looking forward to a smoother (and shorter, I hope) game next time.

Amazing Euro-style game dripping with theme and full of interesting choices.  I've played several times, and I love how dramatically your fortunes can shift from one turn to the next (i.e. you can't count anyone out until the end).

Be aware, this is a very heavy game; casual and even some moderate players may struggle with some of the nuance (particularly the way that performances are scored).  But if your player group can keep up with the mechanics, you'll discover a rich and absorbing experience.  Highly recommended!

(I also backed Mindclash's new game "Anachrony" on Kickstarter and I'm eagerly awaiting its arrival!)

I absolutely love this game. It's big, and it's long playing. And it's an absolute treat every time I get to put it on the table. The box says 30 minutes per player, and if you're just playing the "base game" (which I'd rather call the "introduction version"), you *might* be able to get down to that if you are really fast. If you play the full game in only 30 minutes per player, there is no way you are truly paying attention to your own or anyone else's actions.

This is a game for people who enjoy sitting down and taking their time to figure out great strategies, and who don't mind their opponents doing the same. In my opinion, it should be played like a high level game of chess, where you analyse your own and your opponents' options as many steps deep as possible, complete with backup plans for the actions they may take on their turn. The game mechanic with simultaneously deciding where to place each character in the Assignment Phase, not yet knowing where your opponents' characters will go, then revealing the assignments, and finally, in turn order, having to decide which character to place first, and which to place later, and having to reevaluate what each character can do and what's most important, plays brilliantly into this chess-like deep strategy thinking.

Just make sure not to play this with anyone who'll shout "Analysis paralysis!" as soon as anyone but themself is thinking about a move for a minute or two… :)

There are a lot of interesting things going on in this game, to the point where I wanted to continue going on for a few rounds just to see what possibilities there were.  I barely got time to develop and perform tricks, or set up interesting chains.  I like a lot of the mechanisms going on during gameplay and planning; the only thing I didn't like was that a player could assign one of their assistants to an area and not be able to accomplish anything there, due to there being insufficient action points.  I feel that in a worker-placement game, especially where placement is pre-assigned, players should always have the opportunity to accomplish something, even if it comes at a penalty.

RATING: 8
Deep. Super deep game. Lots of stuff going on here. The theme helps what I feel would otherwise be a frustrating game. The performance part is clunky the first couple times through but once you get it down it flows quickly. 

The almost simultaneous actions help to minimize the downtime. The "30 minutes per player" on the box is laughable though. It's probably closer to 60-90 minutes per player.

EVERYTHING is interconnected. You must calculate every decision you make and every ripple effect it could have every turn. With a steep learning curve and a terrible rule-booklet it will be hard to get this one back on the table after it's been away for a while but I'm enjoying it right now. 

While I will compare this game in scale to Vinhos, I will say that it is no where near as elegant or smooth.

Oh, and it's gorgeous.

Medium Heavy Euro worker placement resource collection game.  I sat down to it at BGG con and though the Theme did not spark great interest it still looked like something I might like.  The problem with my play was the game did not catch me.  I got ahead early on the fame track and that put me way behind on the initative track and there was not anyway to really alleviate that issue and I went into a death spiral of bad choices since I could not get the things I wanted or needed during the last 2/3's of the game.  The game works but it is not unique enough for me to want to continue to try to master.

This is very slow to get into for a first play and just wasn't fun. I was overwhelmed upon first learning the game (lots of moving parts), then underwhelmed at the end game (fell completely flat).

There are some really wonky elements mixed in with some interesting mechanics, but the game just didn't grab me like I thought it would. Actually, I didn't care for it much at all. OK, truth be told I dislike it intensely.

So a great theme but extremely forced execution - so glad I didn't back/buy this game, it's an over-bloated and turgid mess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Neat theme and interesting mechanisms, but extremely heavy when playing with all the expansion content. So hard to manage all the different powers and paths to synergize points that it can lead to an insane amount of AP calculating the best path. The idea of getting certain resources that let you more efficiently transition from one trick to another is like trying to figure out and organize a giant spreadsheet while also playing the game. It has some neat parts and has a decent amount of depth, but the sheer randomness of some of the expansion stuff makes me feel it isn't well balanced overall (such as a Prophecy coming out that benefits one school of magic over others early game when no one can take advantage of it except someone who lucked into it).

A nagy beharangozás után kicsit félve ültem le a játék elé. Féltem a csalódástól, hogy csak a külcsín szép és a belbecs nem üti meg a jó játék mércéjét. Meg, hát szkeptikus is voltam: eddig elfogadható színvonalú magyar gémer-játékkal még nem találkoztam. Kellemes csalódás ért. A Trickerion nem csak elfogadható, igencsak megállja a helyét a nemzetközi mezőnyben is, remek kis játék ez!

A játék, ahogy azt a képeken lehet is látni fantasztikusan néz ki. Gyönyörű, részletgazdag, illúziókeltű, ahogy lennie is kell egy erősen tematikus játéknak. Mindemellett funkcionálisan is minden jól lett kialakítva. A mezők, a lapkahelyek, stb...

Maga a játék is nagyon tetszett. Sok ismert mechanika ötvöződik a játékban (az előadásoknál például a Last Willre asszociáltam). Szépen össze vannak dolgozva a mechanizmusok. Az előadás rész különösen tetszik, remekül eltalálták a készítők. Izgalmas, klassz! Ez a játék sava-borsa.
Viszont: a játék meglátásom szerint kizárólag gémereknek való, nagyon összetett a szabályrendszer (bár ehhez képest letisztultnak mondható), sok mindenre kell figyelni, számolgatni (akár következő körökre is, például, hogy érdemes-e megszereznem egy 16-os trükköt, vajon ki tudom-e hozzá gazdálkodni a hozzávalókat és elő is fogom tudni adni?). Nehéz, agyégető játék. Minden forduló elején a segédek lehelyezésénél (worker placement) komolyan meg kell mozgatni a szürkeállományt. Ennek megfelelően nem rövid játék, de végig leköti a várakozó játékosokat is a tervezgetés.

Kíváncsian várom, hogy több játék után mit fog adni a Trickerion. Az biztos, hogy egy parti után nagyon izgat.

Update: két parti alapjáték után kissé zavar a kiszámítható stratégiai út.

Jó kis játék lett, csak így tovább!

Badly needs a developer to prune an hour and some systems. More chrome than strictly legal.

The theatre priority system makes little sense and needs work.

The blind bidding worker placement preplot is shocking.

RATING: 7.3
tl;dr: solid strategy game.

So this isn't really a first impression, I've already played the short base game twice, and the full game with the expansion once.
It's a fairly involved worker placement style game with lots of interlocking elements. There is a very nice turn angst and timing and preparing for future turns plays a very big role.
The 5 round basic game is streamlined but maybe a bit too short to really invest in the 16 point trick cards.
We also played it with the expansion and the full, 7 round game. It adds a lot of stuff. There is a lot more stuff to keep track of making the game a bit less streamlined and adding some AP. Our first 7 round, 4 players game took almost 4 hours. That is a bit too long. It might be a bit faster on the next plays, but I think I prefer the game without all the extra stuff. Maybe just a 7 round basic game? We'll have to try some different combinations. But you can add and remove modules independently, and that is a nice aspect.

All in all, a nice challenging game that does ask for replays.

Absolutely superb worker placement where theme is magicaly leaking from the board and cards and filling the room with an arcane energy (even if you know it's all just a trick and illusion). It's awesome look behind the curtain of the life and work of a magician - collecting necessary equipment and materials for tricks, learning new ones, gaining assistants to get more work done, do some marketing to let people know about you and finaly get the best time to perform in theater so you can claim the most glory and fame. Simply loving this game. ;-)

Accomplishes so much with... well, with so much. This game captures the groundwork that goes into a successful performance, and wraps it in a stunningly realized setting. I do wish it played a bit more quickly and that some of the fat had been trimmed, but this is a decidedly fascinating game.

When the rating says "I would suggest it"... what I mean is that I would suggest this to my GAMING buddies.

Man, this game was an experience.  Everyone at the table of three was pretty much ready to light it on fire by the end.

The combination of the abundance of resource types, the entire booklet of tricks to pick from (which oh someone else took that one...well now I'm screwed), the completely wonky semi-area of control game with the stage cards giving bonuses seemed entirely out of place.

Then the game took almost 4 hours to play...just too much everything.  This game drowned itself, and it's too bad because the theme and the setting and the art are very catchy...I mean the Prestige is like the best movie ever...but this game...never again.

There's a lot to like about Trickerion. First, the theme. You are stage magicians putting on magic shows by learning tricks, assembling them and then performing them in front of an audience. Second, the art. I really love the art and board in this game. There's a darkness that goes well with the magical/mystical feel of the game.

The game is a worker placement game where you simultaneously assign destination cards to all your workers. Then in turn order you choose which worker to send out. Worker have different amounts of action points they can spend. Additionally, getting to a location sooner gives you extra action points to spend. The actions on offer let you acquire tricks, get materials to assemble your tricks, get assistants/workers, get money, set up your trick or perform your trick.

There are some interesting interactions with how you set up your tricks, as you can have your trick performed as part of someone else's show... which generally isn't as good as performing it yourself, but may be desirable for various reasons.

The game seems fairly complicated with a lot of stuff going on initially (and we didn't even play the Dark Alley expansion that comes with the game). But after you learn everything that is going on, it's actually really straightforward. I liked this game a lot and really want to try it out again with the expansion.

This was my 2015 disappointment. As much as it pains me to say it after a long and much anticipated Kickstarter. The game took a while for only 5 turns, and it ends right when you feel you're about to hit full stride. You build up your system, and then it's over.

The theme is what sold me on this one, along with Rahdo's gleaming review, and those might not be enough. I'll be giving it another try before making a final decision with the Dark Alley expansion and more players. This has me wondering whether I'm as much of a eurogamer as I used to be.

A lot of the mechanics aren't very intuitive, and there's a lot going on. One of my friends commented that there's so much to keep track of the immense amount of strategy starts to feel more like luck. That's a pretty accurate way to summarize the game. 

It also seems to suffer a bit from a runaway leader problem. The full game takes at least 3 hours, which is fine, but you tend to know who won at the end of the first hour.

I've played this 3 or 4 times now, and it still hasn't really "clicked." I couldn't hope to run this game on my own; just keeping score is a game in itself. I want to like this game because it's beautiful and deep, but keeping score requires a math degree and the design feels like learning a stickshift with the gears mislabeled. 

For its problems, there's a lot to like. It's dazzling. The theme works very well with the mechanics, some of which are very innovative. There's very little I could compare this too, which is great. It's refreshing.

With enough plays the figurative pieces will fall in place, but you might use a hammer to force them there.

This was a fairly good game if you have time to play such a long complicated game enough times to grock all it's mechanisms.

Ultimately decided to sell this just because it was never gonna hit the table enough to pay for itself.

Worker placement designs aren't typically my thing, but the theme diverged from most games I play. That being said, I'm glad I took a chance on it. There is a lot of variability from one play to another with Dark Alley and the other additions. The base game probably wouldn't do it for me, but with special assignments, prophecies, and the 2 player duel option, this game has enough in-box variants to calibrate your game for your group.

Gioco formato da + moduli tutti tattici, difficile avere una strategia se non nella scelta del trick in base ai materiali che già si posseggono. tutto li.

Impossibile fare una strategia, tutto dipende dalla situazione del momento, non si capisce cosa centrano gli ordini assegnati nascosti al proprio gruppo di lavoratori e in più aggiungere la meccanica dei punti azione.
un miscuglio di meccaniche inutili prese da tanti giochi diversi, che non si amalgano tra di loro e non si integrano con il tema. Materiali molto buoni, finisce li.

2 aprile 2016 aggiornamento.
Gioco brutto e fatto male fin dalla fase di scelta azioni, non si capisce perché un gioco debba essere punitivo, 5 caselle per ogni azione (mi viene in mente downtown), e 2 carte downtown a ogni giocatore, quindi 1 giocatore avrà una azione downtown sprecata se non riesce a piazzarsi per primo, siproponecome gioco strategico ma poi si scopre essere un gioco di fortuna. Su che basi scelgo le azioni e posso capire se andranno in conflitto o meno? Non esiste un ordine di risoluzione ma si girano tutte le carte in contemporanea e poi ogni giocatore sceglie quale ordine piazzare seguendo una Tattica migliore improvvisata. il gioco non guida nelle scelte. Non finisce qui, a questa meccanica strana viene collegata la meccanica dei punti azione da spendere. ?!? mi sembra una ridondanza strana e poco riuscita. Probabilmente non ho capito il gioco ma dopo 2 partite dove mi sono sentito più spettatore che partecipante ho deciso di dire la mia. Si salva la meccanica "piazza i trick sulle carte" fai l'esibizione e guadagna i punti, ma solo quello, anche se quando ci sono 5 carte dove piazzare i trick (mi sfugge ora il nome) sono troppe ed è difficile che i giocatori entrino in conflitto. Supponendo che ogni giocatore ha sviluppato 2 magie con da 3 trick l'uno da piazzare, rimane comunque molto spazio da utilizzare. Si salva la grafica. La struttura è improvvisata e ruba meccaniche da altri giochi senza farne buon uso. bocciato.

Il gioco usa un sistema aperto che fa acqua da tutte le parti.

This one is a heavy murderous beast. Heavy Euro with fiddly game mechanics and game play. I love it, hard to learn, master and really immersive. The game can be challenging with new players or expansions. The one I dislike is the trick book, which really add fiddlyness to the game without adding anything rewarding (though the tech tree seems rewarding enough, I just wish there's a solution for the trick book.

RATING: 8
Trickerion feels a lot like a worker placement version of Colosseum, with players collecting material tiles in order to put on shows. It's quite a bit heavier though, due to the pre-programming of workers and the planning for an unusual abstract mini-game in the performance phase.

If that's all there was, it probably wouldn't be worth more than a passing glance. But there are other things to consider. One, the game is absolutely gorgeous. The artwork on the boards, the cards and even the player aids take you right into the game's 19th century setting. Another wonderful thing is the connection between the game's mechanisms and theme. Unknown magicians can gain fame quickly and cheaply by putting up a few fliers. As you become more successful and everyone in town knows your name, the reach required to gain new fans increases, which of course also increases the cost of doing so. This is just a catch-up mechanic, but it is so thematically appropriate it doesn't feel intrusive. There is also a neat aspect to the order of performances. The theater is open Thursday to Sunday. The magician that slots into Thursday gets first choice of routines, but takes a fame and money hit, since no one goes to the theater on a work night. The player that performs on Sunday has a packed house and gains extra fame and money. Again this is likely just a game balance function, with the first pick player having maximum choices and taking a penalty for that advantage and the last pick player having no choice at all and getting a catch up bonus as compensation. It feels so thematically justified though, that like the advertising rules, it doesn't feel cheap or tacked on at all.

The character powers weave a fun tale as well, bringing the game to life like an RPG session of Christopher Nolan's film, The Prestige. These magicians are competitive...and ruthless. It makes for a lot of fun over the table trash talk, if you are into that sort of thing, like we are.

Overall, the game has a steep learning curve. Once you've played a two or three rounds the fog clears a bit and you are left with a game that isn't quite as complicated as it seemed when you were trying to make sense of it from the manual. What doesn't dissipate though, is the level of planning needed to execute a strategy. While the fluff puts a lot of emphasis on magic performances, this is really a game about logistics. You have to plot out what tricks you want to learn long before you have the ability to pull them off. You have to order necessary equipment at least a turn before you need it, possibly even earlier, because you also have to set aside actions to actually assemble the equipment and set it up in the theater. In other words, the game is very demanding and difficult to play casually. Tons of planning, tons of adjustments to those plans and generally a lot of frustrations when an event or another player leaves you short of your goals for the turn. You have to enjoy that kind of challenge to love this game, which I do.

The Legendary Magician is seeking a successor worthy of the Trickerion Stone believed to unlock the powers of the Supernatural. Players assume a role as stage magic specialists in illusion, conjuration, escapology, and prestidigitation. Lots to do in this action points worker placement system. Assemble your team with varying strengths from the budding apprentice, to the vivacious assistant, and get the critical help of a manager and trick engineer. I love the secret programmed actions mechanic in a race for limited needs. Cool trick books. Schedule, construct and perform your best tricks to the biggest possible crowds. Great tension for competing uses and needs of the magic crystals. I love the escalating sense of accomplishment through the unlocking systems for assignments and abilities. I love the "pinch" of supernatural at the dark alley influencing prophecy and boosting your programmed actions with assignments. Clever inclusion of two types of rewards to choose between fame or fortune. Other interesting mechanics are placing orders for out of stock materials and the play bill sub game linking with other performer tricks. And, I appreciate that this euro has a luck element that can be mitigated by spending crystals, paying extra action points, or placing an order. The game mechanisms accentuate the rich theme and that is always important for me. Longer game than we typically play and takes a lot of table space.

Played once with 4 players. The game pits players as rival illusionists and magicians trying to put on a show.  Players will need materials, the trick itself, preperation for a show then book themselves on the stage.

Its a worker placement action, where certain actions give you better energy points to spend.

I thought the game was very very long.  It was very complex; and the graphics aren't the best.   

The worst part of the game is overly complexly designed Venue cards.  Why is it necessary to have a puzzle mechanic here?  It serves little to no purpose, and is really abstract.  Simply have a bunch of venues like Las Vegas, New York and each card has a demand for certain tricks; boom - job done with small bonuses if you are first to the venue; but instead you have this complex puzzle where you need to connect icons, make links and I'm not even sure why.

In parts the game reminds me Pret a Porter; you have a specialist skill, you need material, you are planning for a show.

The downtime in the game is also a big turn off.  But I'm sure this will increase with plays.

I'm not sure if its something I really want to play again.  The game is very long, downtime is hard and the whole abstract puzzle venue mechanic is really quite bizarre.

But if you like heavy, long thinky games; this is certainly a good game to play if you have the right group.

This looked interesting but I didn't get to demo it at GenCon so I'm curious to give it a play sometime.

Overcomplicated worker placement. Certain areas feel like mini games in themselves, and with only 5 rounds there's a massive amount of downtime between turns.

Worker placement. Action Point. Simultaneous Action Selection. Couple of my favorite mechanics all embodied in one game. Yes please, I want to me magician!

From first play - bit fiddly and takes a while to explain, but is actually very straight forward - looking forward to  the next game

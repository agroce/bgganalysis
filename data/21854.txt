Kisgyerekkel játszottuk, a pontszámom felnőttként értendő. Memóriafejlesztő játék. Két személlyel csak a memória dönt, de többen játszva nem mindig az jár jól, aki eltalálja a leggyakoribb színt. Épp ezért (ha mindenki megjegyez mindent) már inkább taktikai játék.

Well, it is a memory game with a blend of confusion, mixed up with some quite tactical decisions. Yes, kids do beat adults, but the other way around is also possible. And never forget what is the equivalent of VP:s in this game!!!

Or as we call it, "Pooping Donkeys". This is just fun. The kids love it and I believe it to be a good game to introduce to non gamers as well. A simple memory game with some strategy (should I pick the color of the most in the donkey or the 2nd most?) and great bits make this one a winner.

Actual pooping donkeys.  Does a game really need anything else? :)

It's a memory game with an element of reading the other players to figure out what they will choose when it comes time to score. It's fun and I would have kept my copy if I had children, but it isn't fun enough for me to want to pull it out to play with my adult friends.

Definitely a children's game - kids will probably love the theme ... but I'm concerned over the tiny bits, which look very similar to sweets, "choking hazard" leaps out at me. So I pass on getting this one. As a memory game, there are many others I'd rather play. Good for a laugh as a game for adults, but I suspect the joke will get old quickly.

Great game to play with kids!  The theme and bits alone make this one entertaining, as there's really not much to the gameplay.  You just feed the donkeys and try to remember what they've been fed so you can correctly guess what they will poop out.  As you can imagine, this makes for a humorous game!

It is the memory game done right. First, the potty theme is hilarious. What could be better than feeding donkeys different colored biscuits then having them poop. Second, the simple fact that the donkeys move around throws your typical spatial memory chops out of whack. Third... well... the donkeys POOP!

I love the donkey-poop game. Its a good ice breaker, plays quickly and is ludicrously over-produced. 

Here's an example of the value: I pulled this out during Thanksgiving and we had a 3-generation affair. Grandma and Grandpa, dad (me) and 7 year old son. We all had a fun time and my son won. The rules explanation is about 90 seconds and the jokes run the whole time.

Quite a challenging memory game with an "outguess the other players" component.  I have a tough time remembering the colors unless I assign donkeys a theme and feed them accordingly (one is Univ. of Illinois - feed blue and orange, another is Iowa State - feed yellow and red, last is Christmas - feed green).  The theme, of course, appeals to my 7 y.o. son.  Fun for the kids, though feeding the donkeys can take quite a bit of time for them as the "oat biscuits" are quite small. I also agree with others that the deck set-up is fiddly.  We just tend to leave it in the same stack for every game and don't mess with shuffling A through H individually.  OK game -- we enjoy other memory games more, though.

A memory game – and a fiddly one at that,  so it's fine so far as that goes. But clearly this gets a point for the wooden donkeys and ridiculously silly theme. Strangely it has rarely hit the table, but we've had a lot of fun with the kids when it has.

RATING: 7
I am so impressed with this child's memory game and the publisher Zoch.  It is fast & fun.  Especially near the end of the game deduction also comes into play because the players can see the number of oat biscuits out of play.  To make the game harder for older children, the oat biscuits already won could be kept secret.

I am not one for body humor--I don't appreciate it at all, but I find nothing objectionable about this game.  Donkies eat & poop in this memory game.  The donkies are huge and well-made in wood.  The card's graphics are enjoyable and colorful.  

The kids have the activity of feeding the donkeys & lifting the tails--and although they like it, I do find the feeding a little fiddly.  

I wish the box were much smaller, which it certainly could be, to take up less shelf space.

The manufacturer's recommended age is 6+.  If you have children who do not put small pieces in noses, etc., there is no reason why a much younger child couldn't play this--a 4 year old.

Wow, the components for this game are amazing.  Los Mampfos is a game intended for children but plays perfectly as a light/quick game between a few friends that have shared a couple drinks.  A light memory game with a movement mechanic applied simply to joggle the brain cells, Los Mampfos actually plays fairly well and replaces any short coming in game play with production values, and it's off the cuff sense of humor.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Normally I wouldn't rate a memory game very well, I don't particularly like them. However, this one is a particularly good memory game. (Zoch seems to have a knack for this no?) The moving donkeys, the many biscuits, and the addition of scheming (It is better to be the only one picking the 2 blue, vs one of 5 picking the six red.) make for an enjoyable game.

A very nice, components-wise, game, designed by one of my favourite game designers (Rudiger Dorn - Traders of Genoa), which is clearly aimed at the childrens market. Having said that, adults (me included) seem to enjoy the "fun" of feeding donkeys and then watching them crap. Very good memory game.

RATING: 6
This game is a little awkward to place, since I'm sure that some parents might not want their kids playing the game because of the inevitable potty humor.  At the same time, it might be a little too simplistic or repetitive for adults, even if they may not be able to remember what's inside each donkey.  Maybe it was the late hour at which I played, but I don't think I would be thinking too hard as I play, I tend to just take an intuitive guess.  But the pieces, like most Zoch games, are great, and who wouldn't want to play a game about defacating donkeys?

¡Qué duda cabe que a los niños les encantará un juego en el que unos burritos de madera se hagan caca! Y ése es su mayor atractivo, sin duda. Se trata de ir cebándolos con galletitas de colores para que, llegado el momento, una trampilla culera se abra y muestre el color que predomina en las "boñigameeples" del pollino; previamente, los jugadores han apostado por un color y se llevarán las defecadas galletitas: el que más tenga al final, gana. El problema es que los críos no intentan llevar el control de los colores, obsesionados únicamente por el momento feliz en que se alivien los burros...

Definitely a very good kids' game, its not bad for adults and the theme is kinda "cute" with donkeys pooping.  Its a straight up memory game along with a bit of strategy in seeking to out-think each other as to what color each will pick of donkey droppings.  Cards determine which donkey moves and eats oat biscuits OR which donkey poops its oat biscuits.  Whoever has the most poop at the end of the game wins.

A light, quick and dirty memory game. There's a bit of luck in the fact that you may or may not choose the same color as another player; the net result being more or less biscuits than others. The game tends to even itself out if you are paying attention though. It's alot of silly fun, and I'm glad I own a copy.

Probably pretty good for a kids game, especially if you have boys.

For an adult memory type game, it is pretty weak.

If there is ever a domestic release I'll be all over it.

I simply don't know what to make of a world in which there are at least two games about pooping animals. I say "at least" because I'm sure sophisticated Eurogamers can rattle off a list of 10-15 poop-centric games in alphabetical and chronological order.

Mostly I'm annoyed because I got roped into a game of this en route to playing Android: Netrunner at BGG.CON, resulting in a hurried and aborted play of A: N. "Why, sure, I'd like to guess what color that donkey's poop is going to be! Why wouldn't I?"

It's not an infantile game of pure chance for slackers, drunks and the feeble-minded, like the pooping dog game (I can't be bothered to remember its name.) It has a strong memory element, and it is absurdly overproduced (of course it is). I mean, if you want nice-looking donkeys with functioning entrance and exit holes, this is your game. And there is "skill" involved, so long as you're careful to define skill in a manner that would be comprehensible to a Eurogamer.

Still...donkeys move in a circle, you feed them, you predict the color of the poop, they poop. I am told it's all quite hilarious.

Needs more advanced rules to be truly satisfying.  Perhaps points for majorities in different colours and a mechanic for picking up meals that takes advantage of board movement.  Otherwise, it's just as fun as sitting around guessing the colour of donkey excrement.

Zseniális ötlet, cuki kivitelezés, bár a pici korongokat nem könnyű a csacsik szájába beügyeskedni (nekem). :P
Nem tudom ki hogy van vele, de szerintem lehetetlen megjegyezni, melyik csacsi mit evett, főleg a vége felé, amikor már tele a bendő. Persze nem is ez a lényeg, hanem, hogy nagyjából sejtésünk legyen, melyikből van a legtöbb, és hogy választásunkkal egyedül legyünk. Amikor nyilvánvaló, hogy mi a színek aránya, akkor ez egy izgi döntés elé állít. Nagyon szórakoztató!
Ugyanakkor valamiért nem csábít újabb és újabb játékra, szerintem azért, mert sokszor a döntésem csak "fogalmamsincs-legyenez-majdkiderül". Persze felnőtt fejjel nézem a játékot (bár hozzá teszem az összes többi szuper gyerek játékot is). A beruházást mindenképpen megérte, majd egy gyerekzsűri mond végítéletet.

Los Mampfos is a funny scatological memory game where players have got to remember what wooden chits have been eaten by the three donkeys that circle around the "board" (just to distract, really) at the moment in which they are excreted, and then choose a colour to get the biggest possible amount of manure (if two players choose the same colour they've got to share).

Even though the game demands concentration and a bit of second-guessing the tactical choices don't go beyond the colours to feed the donkeys, so that the game is a bit mechanical for being played only by adults. For its actual target (children) and for mixed sessions Los Mampfos should work wonders.

[as a footnote: sometimes the donkeys need to be shaken quite a bit to get all the stool on the board]

Typical Zoch bits for a memory game with a twist.  Pieces are stored inside a donkey - you have to remember which ones are where. because you will try to win them when they come back out again.  Plays quickly - neat for kids (who generally excel at memory games).  The oak biscuits did have some variations in thickness resulting in some choking donkeys - but more then enough to play with that this isn't a concern.

--July2007-- Very silly game of memory and some modest psychology.  It might be amusing (for adults, at least) to play with a E&T scoring variant; but even the default version provides some entertainment.

This is a kids' game, and fun for adults to play with kids.  Kids and adults have a chance to win with this one, with a skew towards the generally better memories of the kids.  You have to be able to tolerate a whole lot of potty humor at the kids' table in general, so you can imagine how a game about donkey poop affects that! 

It actually has some decision making as to how you're going to load the donkey's food and the combination of moving donkeys with chosen feed-colors makes the memory aspect challenging.  And when it comes to poop color, do you go with the one you think has the most, risking a split with other players, or do you go with what you think is the second most prevalent color?  There in lies the brilliance since if you can consistently predict the second place, you stand a good chance to win...unless of course, everyone else does too!

Donkey poo game.  Yay!

RATING: 6.5
tl;dr: silly but enjoyable

Turn over a card, put a certain amount of food in one of 3 donkeys. Food comes in 7 colors and you get to choose freely. Once in a while one of the donkeys takes a dump. Select a color. All colors are distributed among the players who selected that color, the rest of the poo is eaten again. Most poo at the end of the game wins. Oh yeah, you also move the donkeys on a track. This doesn't influence the game, but it's there to confuse you.
This is a very light luckfest, but it does have it's funny moments and it doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
BGG scale: 6/10

This one is a childrens memory game with a twisted theme.  I suppose that's the only reason for non children to play this game.  The setup of the decks seems unnecessarily fiddly.  Why wouldn't you just have an "A" deck for startup.  A "B" deck for most of the game, and a "C" Deck for the end.  

The cards went all the way to "H" and they had to be shuffled individually.

Played just to be able to say I did.  Very bizarre and good for a laugh, but a kids' game without a doubt.  No idea why they make you do the whole moving around in a circle thing; I guess just to make it harder to keep track of which donkey ate what, but that seems pretty pointless since you just have to remember the color.

Memory game with a cute twist of donkeys pooping the colored oat pellets. Can also be a game of anticipating which color oat the other players will pick so that you can maximize how many oat pellets you get. Supports 2-5 players equally well. No down time as you have to pay attention the entire time so that you can remember what colored pellets go into which donkey.

Memory games are pretty bland affairs, but Los Mampfos contains a mechanism you'll never forget:  pooping donkeys.  It's basically a toy with a game built around it.

Once you get over the fun of the bits and the pooping donkeys, there's not much of a game there. Shame really, because, well, pooping donkeys.

What can I say I like incredibly silly little games like this and I had a good time playing it.  Not sure I'd play this one too many more times as it's just the one basic thing over and over but it does go quickly and was enjoyable.  Would rather play Auto Scooter any day though! :) and I think the Auto Scooter mechanic of the score get multiplied by the number of different colors you have would be interesting as a viable tactic is to try and say remember where all the BLUEs went.

Well, the theme is absolutely hilarious - especially to children of any age.  And that's the target audience.

I won a memory game!  Nanny-Nanny-Boo-Boo!  It helped that people kept stuffing yellow pieces into the brown donkey.  For some reason, I found that easy to remember!

Donkey feeding memory game. Guessing colours different from other players is good thing here.

You just can't go wrong with pooping donkeys.  Just an okay game but worth having for the conversation element.  Doubt it will see a reprint so it becoming more collectible every year.

Pooping donkeys? Yes, my five year old daughter loved [thing=21854][/thing]! (Now 7, she still likes the game.) The game's actually fun though, not just funny. It's yet another memory game variation from [company=87]Zoch[/company], and a good one. You must try to remember what color food each donkey has digested so that you can claim the most poo when it empties its bowels (sounds much grosser in writing, and is funny as heck in the game).

However, it's not just memory. You will have to second guess yourself and consider if voting for the obvious most prevalent color and being forced to share it with the other voters is worth it, or if you should instead grab the second most common color - and that is if you even remember them correctly to begin with!

I recommend this as a family game.

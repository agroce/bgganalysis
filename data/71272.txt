RATING: 6
I successfully resisted buying this at £10 delivered, but one of my game group cracked.
He played it with his kids and they had fun (though he thought they missed the depth).
We played as a game group tonight. It didn't go down particularly well.  I think we wanted to like it, and we certainly played quite viciously, but we were left feeling disappointed.
Nice bits, nice 'prisoners dilemma' gameplay, but ultimately unfulfilling.
The guy who won (on a 4-way tie break) basically did nothing for the last three turns.

The comment was made that on a second play we might get more out of it, but it was pointed out that the problem with that was that we'd have to play it again.

This game is deceptive in at least two ways.  Visually it appears as a light game and not likely to attract much attention from "serious" gamers.  The second is as a highly themed game.  In truth both of these are wrong.  The game is quite a thinking game, especially when seen as an abstract.  The game requires a level of planning and a bit a second guessing your opponents that is far beyond a single turn.  You need to develop a plan that's out 2 or 3 or more turns.  The theme is well done, but it's entirely non-required to play the game.  The game could be re-themed with a Sci-Fi setting and worlds instead of hives and the game would play just great.  The hornet theme is odd actually as hornets are not the first thought when someone mentions hives and honey.  So ignore the theme and treat the game as a multiplayer abstract area majority game and you'll be richly rewarded with a solid, quick and fun game.

Interesting area majority game with a family theme. Components are gorgeous, game plays fast and board is modular. Simultaneous action selection demands for accuracy in reading the other players which adds depth to the game. 

The biggest problem with the game is that I'm not that keen on the theme which leads to dryish game experience.

RATING: 9
I liked this one a lot.   There are a surprising number of important decisions to make, and a couple of "push your luck" vs "play it safe" elements that allow for some more choices.

I also found the theme to sort of make sense, and the little bees pleasing.  Attacking other players is quite costly, which prohibits this game from turning into a random attack-fest.   One of the better short games we've played in a while, and I'll give this an initial rating of 9.   Might go down to an 8 on further plays though.

A game that has been created with this much love and passion deserves a tryout or several for sure. The mechanics have been well tested and tried and the lovely components chosen with care. We feel that Hornet works very well on all the many levels it needs to, and most importantly, it is a highly interactive game where players will have tons of fun! We hope you enjoy playing Hornet as much as we do!

RATING: 5
After 1 play....This game is a blind-bidding game in the vein of Hoity Toity.  I like Hoity Toity better as this game simply has too much king-maker element to it.  You need to win 3 tiles (via area influence) to win the game.  You are blindly selecting a card to remove others influence and/or add yours.  There are different things you can do with other cards...like collect more ammo (nectar) that allow you to do this...or fly to a new tile.  But basically the idea is to win tiles and it just doesn't work.  The only strategy is to hope for a lapse in judgement from the other players thus enabling you to "sneak" in for a win.    Or you could stall the game out (no one gets 3 tiles) and then you win if you've have the most counters on the "total influence board".

Big old-school kingmaker problem  .

A so so simultaneous selection area control game. I thought the game was a little too slow moving and I'm not a huge fan of simultaneous action selection games with the exception of Raj. Although I wasn't a big fan, my friends were, so I'd be happy to play this one again.

RATING: 10
Yes, I'm extremely biased with regard to the rating. So sue me. Besides, a 10 is described as "always want to play and don't expect this to change", which really is the case.
There are a couple of elements which in my view work very well in the game:
-a combination of the tactical and the strategic. While I really need to focus on what the other players I'm directly competing with are doing, I can't completely ignore what's happening at the other end of the board, since the actions there have an impact on whether I want to try a risky action or not. Likewise, it doesn't help that I win the next hive if at the same time someone else is capturing his third hive to win the game.
-The high level of interaction is very much to my liking. The game is not only dry optimization of pieces on the board (which certainly also plays a part), but analyzing your fellow players plays a big role. In fact, games turn out quite differently based on the group you play with. I'm convinced that a highly empathic person with a good sense of human psychology has a very strong edge in the game. Or at least that's how I explain to myself why my wife keeps winning every time I play with her!

The game plays better than it looks.  I have played with 8 people so far.  Everyone thought the game looked so-so, but upon completion of the game everyone said they liked it and would like to play it again.  There are some dilemmas for strategy and it is important to not only think ahead but to be flexible in your setup.  

I like the mechanic of the scoring track where the order of scoring the hives can change as well as the number of actions between the scoring hives; and then throw in the ability to set up the board differently and with these 3 variables, the game changes.

The rules are written in a confusing way, but Hornet is actually a pretty simple, standard area majority game. The twist with this one is that it costs resources (nectar) to place markers (honey) on the board in order to get a majority in several areas on the board, each of which is scored at different points in the game, known ahead of time.  So I can put all of my energy into getting the majority in the next area to score, or I can try to beat my opponents by being more ready within the areas to be scored further into the future.  There are essentially 3 actions in the game, and these actions are chosen via cards simultaneously by each player: collect nectar, add honey to an area, or move. There are 2 cards per action: one is a safe version of the action, and the other is a riskier version that has a better benefit but also can backfire with a negative side-effect if too many people pick the same action type.

I thought this game was pretty decent, but my gripes are the confusing rules, and a poorly designed physical board where there almost isn't enough space to put the honey or to easily see how many spaces for placement are even available.  The nectar adds an interesting element, but also makes it feel pretty fiddly.  The theme is basically irrelevant, and the cover artwork is rather weird, but it's not a bad game.  It's just that there are about 20 other area majority games I'd choose to bring to a games day over this one.

A játékban két méhecskét irányítva kell nektárt gyüjteni. A nektár segítségével mézet pakolhatunk a kaptárakba, vagy vehetünk ki onnan "ellenséges mézeket". Játékmechanikailag mindez akciókártyák kiválasztásával történik. Hat akció közül választhatunk egyet minden körben. Mindenki egyszerre dönt, így viszonylag kicsi a holt idő. Az akciók tudják egymást ütni, azaz nem csak rajtam múlik, hogy végül mit fogok tudni csinálni az adott körben, hanem az ellenfelek által kirakott kártyákon is.

A játék kivitelése nagyon szép. Valami kivételes eljárással készülhetett a nyomtatás, mert nagyon matt és nagyon részletgazdag.
A játékot egy klasszikus eurogame és egy partyjáték ötvezetének érzem. ÉS ez kuriózumnak számít a palettán. 

Két játék után van még kedvem játszani vele, biztos hogy elő fog még kerülni. Kezdő társasosokat is meg lehet rá aránylag könnyen tanítani.

Hátránya talán, hogy ahhoz képest, hogy egy könnyed játék, elég sokáig tart.

Not a bad game, actually. Simple to play and I enjoyed the secret card selection mechanic. Really like the hornet meeple as well! That being said, there were times where there was really only one good move to make, even if you were to suffer a penalty. It is pleasant enough but one I can imagine that isn't pulled out to often. It plays quick. In the end, the safe/daring card selection mechanic was the smartest idea included and I wouldn't mind finding another game that uses this idea in a better way. I like the theme too, regardless of the fact that hornets don't make honey!

A fun game of pushing your luck, choosing different roles, and balancing production and destruction.  Not brilliant, but doesn't demand a great deal of learning or time to play.  Solid design.

Upon more play, it is really just a game of king-making and can really bog down with 5 players.  Not really as fun as I thought.

Sure there are only 6 actions to choose from, but the blind simultaneous selection of them makes it interesting.  Plus, there's still a lot to do with those 6 actions.  

While I prefer an area majority game to operate off of a point system instead of a race to x.  It seems like with experienced players it will come to tie breakers almost as often as a complete race.

I like games like this, where the rules are simple yet there enough going on to make it interesting yet can be completed fast (without rushing).

After leaving my below comments (which I'm leaving until I get a chance to play this game again correctly), the designers of the game Geekmailed me that I was not playing the game correctly.

Upon rereading the rules, I simply thought that the flower spaces all counted as one round.  I didn't pay enough attention to realize each flower petal counted as a round.  So for each flower, there can be a different amount of rounds.  This will definitely improve the game compared to my old comments (seen below).  I look forward to playing this with other people and with this rules realization!

Old comments:
I've only played this alone while controlling 5 players.  Of course, this game would be a lot better with more people, and a simple version of role selection.  One of the more unique ideas is to penalize players who choose aggressive roles.  The penalties for choosing those roles leaves some interesting strategies, especially if you have no honey on the board.

The components are pretty well done, though it feels a little odd having a punchable-score board.  I have a feeling this will lose its hold over time, and may never punch it.  I feel like they could have just printed it plainly on there, and maybe used one modular piece to place on top of it.  The "coin-flip" pieces are average cardboard and don't feel particularly random, but it is a fresh take on just using dice to add randomness.

Tile setup is a bit strange and contributes to my biggest gripe with the game so far; starting position seems too crucial.  That, and your choice of position can get completely screwed over by other players.  There is a serious lack of mobility after the start of the game - you have to spend an entire turn just to move one hornet.  Considering that each turn, another tile gets scored, it'd be nice to have two turns in between each score.  If you get started in a bad spot, especially if it's on higher-lettered tiles, you are probably screwed.  We'll see how this pans out with other players, but I have a feeling that by knowing the importance of starting position, I'll easily win the first game with new players.

I want to like this game more than I feel like I will over the long-term.  It seems like Hey That's My Fish has a similar vibe of hexes and area control, with a simpler setup and explanation, quicker playtime, and more control over the game.  I'll see how this game plays out with others though, and with high hopes and a pretty fun first run, I give it an 8.

I have only played with 2 and we didn't even finish the game it was awful! The decisions are so boring and the limited actions and normal vs. aggressive mechanics just don't work out very well in practice. Reading the rules I thought that it looked decent but the proof was in the playing.

A fun little area majority game that is light on rules, making it seem a little more fun than these types of games usually are (IMO).  I like the theme, and it plays relatively quickly.

It's true that it doesn't really offer anything different, but it's pleasant while it lasts.

Rating is only based on one play.  Even with the modular board, I'm not sure if I'd want to play this with three or less.  The challenge of guessing when it would be profitable to be aggressive and what your opponents will play is interesting.  

I wonder though if the penalties for being aggressive aren't always balanced, particularly if someone manages to snag a hive early on and then is moving/harvesting aggressively and has no combs to lose.

Having played an early prototype and translated (and therefore also read) the rules I can honestly tell that I wasn't expecting too much. It seemed to be a chaotic game of take that with some bluffing. It turned out to be easily manageable chaos with hard fighting, delicate bluffing and a well integrated piece of chance. AP might occur and the Beeples are nice.

Played a 5 player game and everyone was surprised by how good this Tanga bargain game was.
There are many things I like about this game.
1. The theme is unique and interesting.
2. The game board is modular and the pieces colorful.
3. The simultaneous order method (with possible penalties if you select the same order as others) is great in that it speeds the game along and makes game very interactive as you need to pay attention to what other players are doing so you can deduce what orders they may be about to assign. 
4. The luck flip for honey production gives much needed relief to the luckless nature of the game.

I think this game would be a popular hit if it weren't for the offputting muscular bee artwork on the cover.

An adequate area control game with a decent action system. using the cards has an element of risk involved if you choose aggressive actions.

With four, Hornet is a nice area-majority game, with some good struggle for majority - you can destroy what your opponents build, or replace them with yours. Success takes timing and some guessing what your opponents do. All in all pretty neat game, if not exactly my type of game. At least the game looks pretty and stands out nicely.

The two-player game is kind of odd, and not to my liking.

Indifferent.

This is a fantastic game. There are myriad setup combinations and each play has proven enjoyable and unpredictable. The economy of the game is very well thought out and you will be rewarded for custom board setups.

I can highly recommend Hornet!

First impression (5 players) : Overall this is very nicely produced game. There are couple issues with graphics though : a) letters A-J on tiles aren't very visible and b) number of possible honey places on tiles is not visible either once players start placing honey on tiles. On the plus side I really liked how the scoring order of tiles and especially turns between those scorings can be neatly changed.

The gameplay is about simultaneous action selection and area majorities. You choose actions and then resolve them in order. There is a risk taking element so you can either play safe or take stronger action but if too many players choose the same then you get penalized. Because of this element I think game is most fun to be played with either 3 players [where 2 same will be enough] or 5 players as with 4 players you also need to have 3 similar actions and this is less likely. On the other hand with 5 players the game can slow down because of everyone analyzing the board to see just how likely it is to have two other players to choose your action. 

Endgame can be a bit funny as there everyone most likely will choose the same action of placing more control to areas and then only thing determining the player order is turn order that is fixed (starting player does rotate) and can be very crucial. It feels a bit wrong that it actually can determine the winner in a tight game.

Area control and outguessing on a modular board. The scoring system is not very convincing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly light area control game.  Setup / break down is fairly quick.  Game play is quick with actions limited by 2 hornets and set of 6 cars (3 types of actions split into safe and risky).

I really like the game but the game seems to be lacking that "it" quality that makes me want to play it over and over.

Hidden action selection is kind of fun, the game left me feeling meh though.  I am not a huge fan of targeted attack games, which this one has heavily.  The group keeps everyone tight, so you sort of have to be lucky in the player ordering the action before a hive is scored.  Not a bad game at all, I am not sure I would ever request to play it.

After the first game it seems like a nice area control game with a somewhat different theme. The rating might go up after more plays but some of the mechanics in the game are a little bit fiddly in the beginning and this might not be one of the best two player area control games. If you're looking for a good two player area control game I would recommend Carolus Magnus, but also mention this as a good option. Hopefully I get to try it again with three-four players soon.

I haven't played this in like, a year maybe? It was one of those games with ugly art, was bought used and really cheap so it didn't appear to be a good game. It had all the signs that it was going to suck, I was going to give it away but first I wanted to play it just once. 

It was a such a revelation that this was such a good game. WOW!

You are insects trying to gather honey, and you can move, or collect or create through cards you choose at the same time, thing is, if more than one players chooses the same card, you get penalties, there's area majority, there's a modular scoring system, modular board.

games of this were so fun, I decided not to give it away. I'ts been a while since I last played it, but each time I see it on the shelf, it makes me want to. I don't remember some rules, that's why I haven't, but it is a great great game, I hear it is being reimplemented by Queen Games in "Templars' Journey" (awful game) but it doesn't seem to be well received.

If you catch one copy around, please, take the chance, it is a fun little game.

Played the game once at bgg.con and although I really enjoyed the risky decision mechanic, I did not particularly enjoy the game as a whole due to it turning into whack the leader too easily. The lack of ability to consolidate control combined with the power of the switch ability makes the game too chaotic for my taste.

Basic area control game with a weird theme. I typically don't like the kind of outguessing mechanics the game relies on (simultaneous action selection with penalties if others choose the same action), but this one seems to work fairly well. The upkeep phase (adding nectar for every tile after every round) is a bit tedious, but the game is still very fast to play -- especially with just 3 players.

Mechanics: simultaneous action selection (with a push your luck element reminiscent of Witch's Brew), pawn movement, area influence, and indirect conflict. Simple rules and a deduction element, where the second best move each turn just might win you the game. Good balance of intelligent mechanics, very simple rules, and fun. like Samurai, win by flying under the radar and pitting your opponents against each other.

A very pleasant game - light to medium in weight - with a rule set that seems finicky at first but after a few plays you detect an elegant simplicity amongst it various rules. I thoroughly enjoy the option to either play it safe or press your luck in each of your actions, which brings with it some excitement seldom found in abstract strategy games and bridges the gap well between the more harden euro gamers and the more common players who find [b]Settlers of Catan[/b] a heavy gaming experience. The modular board - as well as the modular score tracker (the first time I've seen that!) - guarantee re-playability. I do have some concerns over the method in which hives are scored, which Robert Seater's review did a fantastic job dissecting, but I need to play some more times to see if this is just a perceived problem or an actual one.

Oh, another debit I suppose - I would [b]NOT[/b] play this game with less than four as there isn't enough confrontation.

Great theme and overall fun game. Yes, yes, hornets do not typically produce honey, but its just a game and the game producers shied away from a bee theme that they considered too cuddly for their target audience. I would not have minded a bee theme at all, but I can live with the hornet theme too. 

This is a game of mind-games with your opponents. Do I play it safe for a smaller pay-off, or do I take the risk for either the big pay-off or the nasty backlash? Hmm, what is going on in the other players' minds? What do they need to do to advance their position on the board? I think I am going to take the plunge and go in aggressively. Doh!

It's an abstract area majority game where when played on roughly an equal level turn order will determine who will win various prizes. There is no way to defend yourself from the work you do, which can be frustrating.

Where it really fails in my mind is that most area majority games give some kind of second place, here your pieces get thrown to a pool where if you tie for the lead at the end, your pieces that made it to the hive break the tie. So it behooves you to totally knock out people when scoring. 

The result is scorched earth scoring where some players are effectively eliminated early on and basically have a worse position than what they started with mid-game with no score.

Yuck.

Also, hornets don't make honey.

Solid area control game with simultaneous action selection thrown in.  It plays quite quickly and there are some interesting battles of wits here.

This game combines simultaneous action selection and area majority in a really great little package.  The rules are very intuitive but the interaction between the players is where the game lies.  I love the safe/aggressive card options which really reward careful planning.

Fantastic pieces and presentation as well.  This is a game I'd really like to own.

I really love the appeal of the game. At first it seems to be a game for younger players so you can easily get kids to play it, but then it its hits! You really get sucked into the game mechanics and see past the cute shell of the game. I could easily play Hornet with any age of players, from first timers to pros. A lot of work has gone into this game and me and my group will surely play it in the future. Great job!

An underappreciated gem, this game zips along as you fly your bees across the board, gather honey, and pray that your opponents aren't playing as aggressive as you are. The risk/reward aspect of this game is tense, the variable setup offers a lot of variety, and the theme drips with enough honey that gamers of both Euro and Amerithrash varieties will enjoy.

Rating after one incomplete game at Essen 2010. Area control game with a lot of strategy and even more tactics. Not my cup of tea (too much thinking). Played only until first hive resolution. I found the theme did not come across despite the great looking components, but your mileage may vary. For me, it did not feel like flying around and collecting honey and attacking other hives but rather like an abstract area control game.

Area control game. Pretty sure not ignoring the rule where you can't move arbitrarily past all the bushes would make more of a difference in the outcome of our game.

Like [thing=37680][/thing], one of the core mechanisms is secret role selection, with explicit punishment for selecting the same role as someone else, and the issue is nearly forced, depending on the number of players.  The rest of the game, however, is a pretty interesting buzzing about for control, not entirely unlike one of my favorite games, [thing=9440][/thing].  The reconfigurable design of the board and playfield adds good replay value, as well.  Were I to alter the core card mechanism a little, I think I'd actively like this.  I think I may cook up just such a variant....

這是個捉心理的佔地遊戲。現在大家不是小蜜蜂，而是大黃蜂。除了大家同樣要努力採花釀蜜外，還會霸佔蜂巢。

遊戲圖板由六角形圖板拼合而成，分蜂巢及一般草地。玩家各有2隻大黃蜂，會奔走於各處、採花蜜、釀蜂蜜。 
隨著遊戲推移，各個蜂巢會逐一結算。蜂巢結算時，誰在蜂巢內放上最多蜂蜜，即會佔有這個蜂巢，並盡數取得該處的花蜜。已結算蜂巢上的蜂蜜，即會移送至一旁封存。

誰人佔到3個蜂巢，誰即勝出遊戲。當所有蜂巢都已結算後，又無人佔到3個蜂巢，則在佔到2個蜂巢者之中，誰封存了最多蜂蜜，誰即是贏家。

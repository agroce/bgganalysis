Simpler approach than Mordheim with customization reserved for wizard, apprentice, and composition of warband. Generally fast, brutal action. Would enjoy more detail in combat but the star of the game is magic.

Finally! An independent Mordheim-like game of spell-casters and warbands! I'll need to root through my collection of minis to come up with something suitable to field...

RATING: 7
Initial rating based on a couple of plays. I like several things about this - variability of attributes of the various followers, the spells really encourage creative use in the game, the set of scenarios provided, the opportunity to break out "snow effects" for modelling and obviously the campaign game options. However the rules are written in a slightly loose style that won't support competitive games.

I haven't played this yet, only read the rules, but based on the reading, I'm actually quite excited to play this.
Before reading it, I thought this game sounded too simple, but now I'm actually looking forward to having a minis game that can (presumably) be played in an hour or less.
Also, you can use basically any fantasy miniatures with this game.
I'm not sure if this will be a Mordheim killer for me, but I think it has the potential to be.

This is a fun game. Simply enough to not be rules heavy, but complex enough to be challenging to a veteran gamer. Simple opposed D20 rolls keeps the combat rolling by.  Complex campaign system is where the game really shines, but also where it does sort of get bogged down by rules. I enjoy the low model count. You don't need to by hordes of their minis to play this game.

Love the game as it was written. I love even more how easy and flexible it is to customize. The perfect level of depth without being too complicated or a time sink. Yet, I can add elements as much as I choose to add depth and story. And don't be fooled, this plays just fine on 2D terrain such as Descent or D&D adventure tiles or even appropriately themed HeroClix maps! Don't rule it out just because you don't have a 3D collection!

It's exactly what I am looking for in a warband skirmish game. Perhaps one day something will replace it and its rating will lower but best as I could find this dart is closest to the warband spellcasting bullseye. Its got that old school blood bowl fun to it. Love it!

RATING: 9
Light, fast paced. This IMO is superior to some of the other commercial marketed skirmish games like Imperial Assault. It helps you get extra mileage out of your minis and terrain from other games as a bonus.  Although not marketed as such, this game plays quite well solo.

RATING: 6
Really quite quick and very brutal. We are already considering swapping the d20 for 3d6 to make it a little less brutal and a little less swingy-bad dice rolls do not necessarily mean you die in one shot. 

It requires a lot of terrain otherwise archers are very very powerful since the 24" range is the majority of the board. 

The spell system is very intuitive and the experience and level up system is very slick. Enjoying this one so far.

Sold at the firestorm bring and buy 2016.

RATING: 10
A great game. A gigantic Bestiary, tons of spells, streamlined rules. A blast.

D20 is very risky and some people can hate that. I think game give its flavor when it's played with scenarios and/or campaigns. A free for all fight is fun but not to play every time, it's better with clear objectives and specific rules of scenarios and monsters in game.

It is very easy to create your own campaign and scenario.

A very very very very very very good surprise !

Up rating 9 to 10.

RATING: 6
After one game, I find myself ambivalent.  There is a lot of flavor, but it is heavily channeled through the wizard characters while the rest of the band is faceless.  Mechanically, this is probably a smart way to go, but I find myself more interested in the ne'er do wells who come to Frostgrave without the allure of magic.

In play, the game is all over the place, with an incredibly swingy d20 system and campaign mechanics which more or less tell balance to go take a hike.  The campaign has a rich store of one-off scenarios to pepper into the treasure hunts, but I wonder how many people will experience much of it, given how quickly the balance can go pear shaped.

Frostgrave is a blast.

It's easy to pick up -- simple without being at all simplistic. It feels like a refined, tested design; thereâ€™s no fat on it, and everything that's there is interesting. Quite a lot of D&D pokes through, too, even though the game has nothing to do with D&D.

I absolutely love the turn structure, with each "mini-turn" offering interesting things to chew on: the order in which they occur, how you position soldiers for group activations, the way leaving a bunch of soldiers until the final phase can feel like a bum rush, etc. Attack resolution is brilliant, and keeps things moving briskly.

I like the swinginess of the d20-based resolution system. It keeps things surprising. After my first play, I found myself thinking of things I'd do differently next time, and rethinking my wizard and warband. I lost that game, which isn't uncommon for me, but I had a fantastic time losing. Thatâ€™s one of the surest signs of a great game for me.

RATING: 4
One of the biggest disappointments.   This miniatures game is one of the most random games I have ever played.  Moreover, opposed d20 die rolls just don't work.   Way too swingy.   Lastly, the entire purpose of the game is to race for treasure.  There is no reason to engage the other warband.

A squad based skirmish game where you act as a fledgling wizard leading a team of treasure hunters in a deadly duel for loot and the chance to learn new and powerful magic. I really enjoy the simple rule set, the fun of building and watching your little war band grow as you recruit new members and trying not to push your luck and die at the hands of your adversaries and have to pass the whole thing off to your apprentice. In the same vein as Mordheim but with a lot less fiddly things to keep track of over time.

The best small scale campaign skirmish game I've ever played.  The warband is limited to 10 models (11 with the right upgrade) including the wizard leader and his apprentice, if he has one (he should).  Only the wizard gains experience, but the soldiers can be equipped with a single piece of magic gear.  The campaign system has just the right balance of simplicity for easy play and crunch to satisfy that odd desire for fiddly bits to juggle when gathering treasure or leveling up.  I have enjoyed this game every single time I've played it, win or lose.

It is hard to distinguish  this game from the countless similar fantasy skirmish games. The game strongly suggests a theme limiting terrain to a frozen city. The advancement system leads to divergence in competitive play. Overall, a number of questionable choices atop a perfectly fine set of combat rules and spell rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Skirmish game that scratches an itch.  A relatively simple ruleset, though can be a bit random/swingy at first due to opposed D20 rolls, though that wears off.

The only important member of the warband is the wizard, every one else is expendable (to a point).  There are no racial stats, so you are not limited to what models you can use (I know most gamers won't care anyway, but it means there's no chance of accidentally confusing your opponent).

As one-off games, or for just a few planned, the rules work fine as written.  However, if an extended campaign is planned, especially with players that might not be available the same amount of times then be prepared to have to house-rule the campaign element, else it may be that one warband will run away with it.

Ratings; as it stands now, 8.  If the author looks at the campaign structure as he has said, the rating will probably go up.

Fun and simple to play. The big downside is the requirement for terrain. I use flip-maps and map packs from Piazo. Works okay. Of course 3D terrain would be better. Simple enough to pick up and play in an afternoon. A two person game goes pretty quickly, my son and I finished our first game in 2 hours. The four person game I'm involved in takes about 5-6 hours. There is enough variety to keep you interested.

Have only played this twice so far, but both games were a lot of fun. The single die-roll mechanics increase the luck factor and spells aren't easy to cast successfully (and particularly hard for less-experienced apprentice wizards), so it's difficult to form a solid tactical plan. That said, it could be my inexperience showing through. The variety of spells, interesting activation sequence, ease-of-play, and superior campaign elements are what make the game really good. I can only see this getting even better with expansions. I have a hunch that with more plays, my rating may increase for this game.

Great bones, but maybe not enough meat on them in the base game. I'm looking forward to adding more to it. Very luck-dependent, but it's a miniatures wargame so it's to be expected.

RATING: 9
A tremendously entertaining miniatures game in a dramatic setting - although it can be played using any buildings or terrain in your collection. The core mechanic of opposed rolls with modifiers on a d20 - that determines both victor and damage level - is elegant and will doubtlessly be adopted to other skirmish settings.

RATING: 8
I'm not a huge tabletop miniature gamer. I have had quite a bit of fun with the various Wiz-kids pre-painted lines, but otherwise it's a part of the hobby that just hasn't interested me. Frostgrave has completely turned that around. It's a ruleset without a required miniatures line (although they do make Frostgrave specific minis, for purists) so I have been able to dive right in with a big pile of minis I already have.

It's a game about recovering ancient lost magic, which is to say that rarely will your main character, a sorcerer, have any idea what he is doing. Spell-casting and combat are swingy and random, but instead of hindering things it actually makes it more entertaining. Think Wiz-war, but with an entire warband to run around the maze grabbing treasures instead of just one guy. Combat is deadly and usually over in one or two swings, but you get to roll again after the match on a pretty forgiving survival table to see if anything is permanent.

It reminds me a lot of Bloodbowl and friends tell me it is even more like Necromunda, with players getting more and more attached to their characters as they grow and equip them and all the fun that comes when they make a big play or take an unlikely hit and go down for the count. The rules are tight enough to make game play a breeze, but loose enough that players can just make story boosting handshake rulings when silly stuff comes up like trying to pole vault a pit from a freshly cast magical mud slick.

Spell acquisition is completely random as well and while that may frustrate some players, I think it really fits the theme. There is enough combo potential among the various spell school lists to make finding uses for whatever you get possible, if you put some thought into it. Even when you can't find it, the most useless of spells sometimes seems to spring to tactical significance out of nowhere, as that mud spell I mentioned previously once did for me.

The game is a hoot and the rulebook only costs 15 bucks. If you are into this sort of thing at all, it is certainly one you should check out.

Note: We are using Star Wars minis and calling it Sith Lords on planet Frostgrave. So far, our decision to make these sorcerers space wizards instead has been EPIC. Seriously. Go buy the book!

Simple city based post apocalyptic fantasy skirmish game (feels like mordheim  with wizards...) fast play and fun, not as much scope for development as mordheim  (or necromunda) as only wizards (and by that their genetically linked apprentices..) and captains gain any form of advancement, that said its  enjoyable and would be a good introduction to miniatures games. Hopefully with the next release (into the breeding pits) allowing for dungeon delving style games and the possibility of the first non-human "gang" the game will begin to feel less "samey"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simple rules allow for a perfect introduction to the fantasy wargame genre, while the RPG elements of the campaign system keep players engaged in a story. Though I am not sure how balanced the game is at high wizard levels, starting off feels fair and well crafted. The creativity and selection process of wizard spells keeps you wanting more. Future expansions could benefit from specific scenario design with certain wizard levels in mind, like "For Wizards Level 10-15" or something similar. But as the designer said, make it your own!

Beautiful artwork and good sculpting (save the defecating bear) make for a great visual game as well. Well done.

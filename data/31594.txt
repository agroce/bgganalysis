RATING: 7
Provisional rating based on 1 play.
The game is simpler than it looks to learn and play. But more complex than it looks to play well!
It is also a lot more vicious than it appears.

I love the mechanics in this game and they fit together really well.

The theme also works well - it is really cool to see that all of you face the same challenges/opportunities (effectively playing against the game) but then there are not enough solutions (in a 5 player game) for everyone to get through unscathed.

My favourite game from 2007. It's very much a eurogame but at the gamers end of the scale and more interaction than most eurogames. Several strategies to adopt and all plays out in 90 mins. But the game system punishes you and recognising that you are going to take some hits and planning for it is key.

RATING: 8.5
My highest rated game based on BGA plays alone. Fascinating decisions, seems to have good depth yet easy to learn and flows really nicely. I don't understand the "too harsh" view on this game that some have - the player who weathers the storms the best might come dead last! The disasters are constraints within which you have to work to get the most VP, and chances are if you're not losing people you're falling behind the 'greedier' players. 

Second Feld game I've played, second 9 I've given him - will have to try more of his work...

A great, tense resource management game.  I love that there is a high attrition rate no matter how well you manage your actions and workers, so losing them has to fit into your planning.  I also like the mechanic for turn order, very different than other games I've played.

RATING: 8
Crisis management with a victory point engine humming along.

Seems to scale well, definitely a gamer's game, not sure if fun is a word I would use, but interesting to play.  Some variability each game with the order of events for the game, and the order of actions each round.  Need to always manage your money, resources, workers, homes, and point collecting.  

One complaint is the terrible components-  tiny, junk quality cards (!!!), and surprisingly flimsy action tiles.  A bit surprising after the solid components in Notre Dame (by the same designer, company).  It's also worth noting that while Notre Dame is definitely a different game, there is a slightly similar flavor here, although in Notre Dame it's more "fun" to be constantly staving off disaster.

Own the [boardgame=165348]Great Wall & Events[/boardgame] mini-expansion from the [boardgame=40688]Treasure Chest[/boardgame].

Rated down to an 8.  Not due to the game itself, just kind of the fiddly set up and the need to explain the rules.  Its a good game, but in a world where you don't get to play much and you have to explain the rules, it goes down a touch.

Tight mean little game. It a game of controlled accumulation and unaccumulation.  I can see why people don't like the game, but I really like action selection and I like this type of resource management.  I suspect its a reason I like Container, I do appreciate a game which typically trends upwards, but there is a nasty downside if you're not careful.

But unlike something like dungeon lords, you don't have to totally preprogram your turn.  I hate it when I get boned like that...and then on top of it you get punished heavily for mistakes.  That was not fun.

The pinnacle of Feld's career as a game designer: multiple layers of player interaction, nasty side effects, a satisfying ebb and flow. The large favors draw too much attention to themselves which, unfortunately, keeps this game from being a true masterpiece.

Fantastic turn pace - Pick a randomized action (pay 3 to go to one pack already picked). Play a unique player card to acquire a pagoda denizen (and their unique abilities), deal with event and do end of turn scoring. Events and abilities include hold fireworks show, disease, famine, war, taxation. Other abilities/actions allow for points (immediate and over time), building levels and bonus points.

Fun!

A fairly simple, and logical, exercise in action-selection with a harsh killing-off phase whereby you lose much of your tableau each round. It's dry, but clever. Not Stefan Feld's best (I favour Luna and Castles of Burgundy), but still head and shoulders above many other designers' works.

Traded away for Keythedral. I have found after playing Luna, that each of Feld's games have felt rather dry in comparison. ITYOTD was just too lacking in personality. I wouldn't pick it over Notre Dame or Castles of Burgundy, which I also own, so decided it could find a better home.

Very tightly designed Euro balancing a well implemented theme with original feeling mechanics: from the player order to picking actions, using persons while balancing your growing palaces. The events will definitely keep you on your toes. Agonizing decisions each round force players to look ahead three or four rounds. You will suffer losses without a doubt, but thoughtful planning will win the day. How do you reliably win this game? I have no idea. And I  love it!

Otro gran Feld. Más sencillo y rápido que otros suyos, pero que hay que pensar y planificarse como si no hubiera mañana! (A veces no la hay xDD). No perdona fallos y es muy árido. El diseño es sobrio y la sensación del juego es fría incluso más de lo habitual en un euro, pero es un muy buen juego con una mecánica sencilla pero curiosa. El orden de turno es extremadamente importante en este diseño de juego. Falta probarlo más partidas a más jugadores, con 4 o 5, ya que de momento partidas a 2 me han gustado mucho, y a 3 no tanto.
Lo peor: El factor azar de barajar las losetas de acciones y ordenarlas en grupos, le da chispa al juego pero también lo puede hacer desmerecer mucho, siendo determinante si 2 acciones que buscaban los jugadores, da la casualidad que salen juntas en el mismo grupo... Dejando este detalle azaroso a parte, es un juego excelente.

After 1st play: The game is quite nice and plays fast. Rules are relatively simple yet gameplay is rewarding. However, I have to complain a little about the way how easily you can calculate the value of each individual move. You don't see only the move's potential but the absolute value, and this is what annoys me a bit.

Nonetheless, I would play this game any time without complaining.

*Rating based on one play.

This is the first Feld game that has really fallen flat for me.  For one, the board is extremely drab and not much to look at.  Additionally, the person cards you play in order to gain a new person have no indication on the card of what the related tile does, and it's very easy for a player to discard the wrong card when choosing a person.

As far as gameplay goes, everything is pretty straightforward and there does seem to be deep strategic choices, but for a reason I can't put my finger on those choices didn't seem all that interesting.  The game is quite punishing in that there are lots of mechanics that cause players to lose what they have built up, so maybe that has negatively impacted my impression of the game.

I wouldn't mind giving this one another try before I finalize my feelings about it, but after the first play, it definitely falls far short of other Feld games I enjoy much more: Castles of Burgundy, Bora Bora, and Der Speicherstadt.

It's amazing! Such an elegant, clean design! 

Your first priority in this game is preventing bad things from happening to you. Then you can think about getting some victory points. That's why the first game or two can be a brutal experience. Playing this game is like taming a river.

A crazy optimization game.  Very much a similiar game as Notre Dame.  I have my suspicions that if you made the rats stronger and allowed their penalty to happen more than once a turn, it would feel just like this game.

I found the claims that there is less interaction in this game than Notre Dame to be untrue.  It's pretty close to the same level.

Abstract:
A game about preparing for the "worst" by Stefan Feld. Players have to prepare for different - mostly bad - events in the upcoming 12 months (rounds). Each round, actions cards are randomly distributed into sets depending on the number of players. By turn order, a player selects one set and pays a penalty if the set has already been picked. The player then executes the action of the chosen set. After that, players hire persons who improves the effect of one of the available actions.

Round overview:
a) Select a set of actions and then an action from that set
b) Hire a new person (maybe discard an existing person if there is not enough space in the palaces)
c) Event
d) End round scoring

Action overview:
a) Taxes: collect Yuan (money)
b) Fireworks: collect fireworks
c) Research: collect books
d) Harvest: collect rice
e) Buy privilege (provide victory points every round)
f) Build: create new or expand existing palaces - palaces provide victory points and they provide room to "store" additional persons (a palace must be occupied to prevent decay).
g) Military parade: move up on the turn order ("person") track
h) Pass: restock to up to 3 Yuan
Note: the strength of these actions depends on the persons each player has in his palaces.

Event overview:
a) Drought (discard rice or loose persons)
b) Mongol Invasion (VP for warriors or loose a person for weakest military)
c) Tribute (paying coins or loose persons)
d) Plague (provide medicine or loose people)
e) Fireworks (get VP for most firework tokens)

Pros:
+ Managing palaces and persons is dynamic: provide room for persons and hire/fire them when necessary
+ Not all negative effects can be avoided (finding best trade-offs)
+ Player order is very important, but can be mitigated by paying money
+ Competition for player order depends on which persons the players pick
+ Selecting a set of card requires interesting decisions: pick what one needs most or pick what other players need most and try to block them
+ Preparing ahead for the particular events is very challenging
+ Finding a trade-off between picking old or young persons (action efficiency VS climbing up the player order)
+ May provide a tense feel of survival
+ Minimalistic design
+ Wall mini expansion: adds a semi-coop element to the game but it sucks up a lot of actions which could be used otherwise, therefore, it should be played with higher player counts to distribute the additional wall action on all players
+ Super event mini expansion: adds some variety without adding complexity. Each game, the 7th event is accompanied by one randomly pre-chosen super event. So, players have to plan/prepare more ahead for that event
+ Plays well with 3-5 players. Two players works but feels differently because the first player can focus more easily on blocking the other player during the set selection phase.

Neutrals:
# Artwork is okay, functional, boring main board
# No luck involved
# All events are laid out in random order at the beginning of each game
# No hidden information
# All game elements appear in each game (no difference each game, except for the super event mini expansion)
# Strategical game: plan ahead for the next events
# Indirect player interaction: player order, selecting a set of actions, limited number of person tiles available
# Punishing if one is planing badly (no catch-up mechanism)
# More about efficiently surviving than creating something permanently
# Scoring happens between rounds and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Missing player aid: the game could be very easy to teach but an overview is missing to explain the relationships between the different persons, actions, and events
- Components have not been upgrade in the 10th anniversary edition, but it at least contains the mini expansions
- Set-up: a lot of person tiles need to be sorted (number of tiles depends on player count)

Thoughts:
What I like most is the minimalistic, elegant design: only a few intertwined mechanics create a lot of depth. I like the tension that the events create: sometimes you just want to survive the game somehow. It can be very harsh and punishing, you need a group which like this kind of game.

Contiene mecánicas sencillas y no depende de texto alguno, pero precisamente por esta "no-dependencia" provoca que la primera partida sea un poco caótica hasta que los jugadores se acostumbran a él. Más allá de esta primera partida es un gran juego. Mecánicas que recuerdan a los grandes (Puerto Rico, Agricola, Le Havre) pero con partidas más cortas para cuando no se puede o no apetece darle a estos últimos. Además, aunque sólo he jugado 2 veces al escribir esta nota, parece que tiene una gran rejugabilidad.

Tras 4 partidas efectivamente gran rejugabilidad.
Otra partida más y subo la nota a 8.4

Feels like Notre Dame, if Notre Dame hated your guts. It's just not a lot of fun, and I don't feel like I've really achieved much by the game end (even when I won). It's also very dry. Normally I really like resource management games, but this one just fails to grab me.

A game of damage mitigation.  I like the anticipation and planning for the events.  I like the different workers and the fact that players can only have a limited number of them.

It's ok.  In theory I thought it was a better game than Notre Dame, but perhaps less fun despite the theme and the differences from other games.  Needed an auction, or card draft, or something, though certainly an "interesting" game in a way, just not that fun.

I now also think the double privilege and the initiative track are a real problem.  Bleah.

Players are Chinese rulers who spend their time trying to avoid the effects of the monthly events (mainly disasters) and make a profit from the few months when nice things happen. All players do this by building palaces, employing staff and obtaining resources to negate the effects of monthly events over a year(hence name of game). An interesting game where the players are fighting the game instead of each other although of course what your opponents do reduces your ability to do things. Thoroughly enjoyed all games played.

I bought In the Year of the Dragon as a blind buy because it was on my recommended list. I needed an extra game to make it to free shipping and the theme and mechanics sounded appealing.

Lucky for me this game offers so much more than an appealing theme and mechanics. Everything in the game feels so tight and fluid. It has nearly seamless game play that rewards strategic thinking. The game is very punishing so I would not recommend it for those casual gamers who are just looking to play a light game.

The feel of the game can be very negative at times. You are walking up a seemingly endless hill for most of the game trying not to trip and break your leg in the process. Overall, this game gets better the more we play it. Definitely going to be a favorite for years to come.

I rated this poorly after playing the computer version. That was a mistake.

I get the impression that there are a lot here on BGG for which this is the only enjoyable Feld. Well, I'm of the other camp that thinks this is the weakest Feld I've yet played.

I still enjoyed it.

There are two games here: the obvious "survive the storm" game and then the much more nuanced "get points while doing it" game.

What's great is that, while related, these two layers are distinct and only eventually do you realize that it's this second game that matters. And then you have a bunch of really interesting decisions to make. Now you're not solely thinking about surviving the events (which, if that's your focus, can be pretty easy) but about how to maximize your points. Often, this means you want to survive most events but occasionally you'll want to let some folks go.

With few players it does get pretty easy to manage the crises, which isn't ideal, but I can imagine it gets a LOT tighter with more and I'm eager to play it as such.

At heart, this is yet another Euro-efficiency game, like the designer's previous effort, Notre Dame, which I didn't like at all.  So why do I like In The Year of the Dragon?  

Like Notre Dame, ITYD has damage limitation, yet implements it in a much more varied, painful and interesting manner.  There's a really tough balancing act between building a v.p. engine and staving off calamities.

The turn order mechanism is particularly well implemented and I've twice ignored it - to my cost.  Turn order is hugely important as the first choice of an action is free, but latecomers have to pay and money is really tight.  ITYD introduces another trade-off, between hiring veterans, with strong abilities but contributing few points towards turn order, and novices who offer the opposite. 

As with many good Euros, your actions are very restricted and there is always more you want to do - and do it before your opponents. You get just 12 actions plus the chance to hire 13 people. So every decision is significant, there is no fat on this game at all.  

Crucially for me, ITYD has a bit more interaction than many other euros, with players competing on many levels and their actions having clear effects on others.

I haven't yet played enough to comment on viable strategies, but there seems to be enough variability to prevent this game being solved and to make it (a bit) different every time.   

While others have grumbled about a pasted on theme, I think it is quite well applied and evocative.  The board is functional if not that interesting, the other artwork is nicely done.

Its a really tight eurogame. You have to plan ahead and dont leave anything for the last moment. All information is open. No luck in the game. Plays in about an hour and its full of tough decisions to make. It seems to me like a great game. The order of the events results in quite different games which adds to the replay ability of this game. Well done Mr Feld.

Like Notre Dame in many ways (less random though), a good Euro that packs into not too much time a great deal of agonizing decision-making. Like ND, a good one to pull out when you want a meaty game but don't have time for something longer. The different order of the month tiles each game prevents samey-ness.

Should try playing with one or both of the Treasure Chest expansions.

RATING: 8
Very brutal game.  The key strategic insights to playing well is to: 1. recognize the importance of initiative, 2. know that you can't save everything, 3. plan ahead.  Most Euros I enjoy tend to have a balance between strategic and tactical play and that was my impression at first.  But at least with the opponents I go against, it turns out there is a strategy that is virtually full proof.  By going with the strategy of seizing and keeping initiative early in the game, I have only lost once, and that was because I deliberately took it easy with some new players and failed to realize that they were in better shape than I thought.  I think the only way this strategy fails is if an opponent consciously attempts to take back initiative.  The problem is that doing so will usually lose the game for both of us, so if I can creditably commit to the strategy first, it becomes suicide for the next guy....

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Only four phases per round, which superficially seems too simplistic; but, it has a good screwage factor, a necessity to  pay attention to money and hand management, the ability to plan ahead and many paths to victory.

Because the event tiles come out at random, each game will require a different initial strategy.

A little low on the ranking only because seasoned players may not find a huge amount of replayability once they figure it out and there are only five events, faced twice each.

Also, there's a first-game learning curve that really punishes first-time players.

After one play, I am not exactly sure where I stand on this game. On the one hand, Year of the Dragon really feels original and interesting. Thematically, the game works pretty well. The game mechanics are reasonably easy, and the play time is relatively short.

On the other hand, this game is fiddly for first timers, and the overall ambiance of this game feels a bit somber. (As one friend said about this game: this game wants to kick your a** and let you know that life is rough.) Need to play it a few more times to get to know it better.

Un-Euro brutality, one of those games you can fail to lose rather than win, at least while still early on the learning curve.  Seems imminently optimizable to me, and it looks like many on the forums have taken up that torch.  Interesting debates RE: double privilege openings and such.  I liked it a lot on a first play (with a couple rules gaffes), later visits on MaBiWeb were a bit sterile to me though.  Might have something to do with not having the rules and personal experience aspects down cold, which I usually do with games I play online.

I thought maybe I missed something after the first game I played of this, as we misplayed some of the rules, and I was tired at the time.  Three quarters of the way into a second play, I can see that I didn't miss anything.  This game just isn't fun.  Most of the characters and actions are redundant or useless, and depending on the order of the events, the first players to grab the monks can stay up front all game, taking the only actions anyone wants.  Boring, with few apparent paths to victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Love this game.  Lots of strategy, lots of planning, yet a touch of luck to make it more than just an analysis-of-best strategy/tactics game.  Even if you are a total noob, you can still do well, but a veteran player will have quite the advantage.

This game has lots:  pre-planning, strategic thinking, some "screw your neighbor", and lots of "disaster-mitigation".  A little hard to learn at the beginning, then -- whoosh -- off you go!

I'm hard-pressed to think of a game I enjoyed more the very first time I played it.  Well-done!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This a game that could easily be prone to AP.  The decisions are actually not that hard, but in the first play it is hard to see far enough forward to know what to do.  The interaction between players is pretty low, but the game mechanics are solid and work well.  The game definitely has a feel of multiple paths to victory.  I wonder if they played around with the idea of hiding events until the event is revealed for the turn.  It might be too hard to plan that way.  Overall a favorable game that should be played again.

I adore this game in every way - all my decisions are so intertwined, game to game variability, painful decisions. I love it's brutality.

Nice euro with several different tracks that you need to prep for.  It does play relatively straightforward.  You know what's going to happen and you can prepare for it.  

Don't forget that after the second event of each type, it's time for those workers to be removed.  One strong move that I saw from someone who had played several game was to spend 6 yuan and buy a privilege tile right off the start.

RATING: 7.8
This is a great game that includes disaster management and hand management. It can be a pretty punishing game if you make a mistake, and I love that about it. In this game you can't possible prepare for everything, so you need to figure out what you can allow to happen that will inflict the least damage to your score. There are lots of interesting decisions and choosing a combination of workers that will both help you accomplish your goals and keep you near the front of turn order can make for really interesting decisions.

One advantage of teaching this game is that all information is open and it's easy to give suggestions.

RATING: 7.5
Too aggressive for my group, but the few on-line games I've had are really fun, full of those "of these few choices I really can't make up my mind!" moments I just love. Still, I prefer Notre Dame.

UPDATE: Now I get more of it's subtle tactics, I enjoy it even more. There are myriads of ways to get points, which, in the end, are the only thing that matters. The question is how to obtain the most of them, given the event order and other player's actions. It's a highly tactical game, but with a little dose of healthy strategy thrown in. Up to a 9.

UPDATE: I still enjoy it a lot, but I feel it's not that fresh anymore. Down just a notch, to an 8.

In the Year of the Dragon is designed in the same "disaster management" mold as ND except it pushes the envelop even more. Over a 12 turn game, there are in essence 4 peaceful turns. All other turns have a significant disaster that players have to deal with whether it's wealth generation for taxes, or food generation for droughts, or militia development to fend off the Mongols, etc... Probably the most significant difference between ND and In the Year of the Dragon is that all the events and the event order are known at the beginning of the game for In the Year of the Dragon. As such, there's a greater emphasis on long term strategy for In the Year of the Dragon. That being said, there are still some tactical elements as players struggle to gain the upper hand on the personality track, which determines play and action drafting order.

In the Year of the Dragon is definitely heavier than ND even though it plays in roughly the same time frame (roughly 1 hr). I think ND plays better at the lower end of the scale (2-3 players) while In the Year of the Dragon plays better at the higher scale (4-5). I suspect people who don't like the disaster management aspect of Notre Dame wouldn't like In the Year of the Dragon as it's even more brutal. People who enjoy ND will likely enjoy In the Year of the Dragon. Some "gamer" gamers will prefer the greater control afforded by the pre-ordained events.

RATING: 8
Nem rossz a játék, de más játékosszámmal is ki kellene próbálnom. A véletlenszerűen sorsolt események képesek teljesen átértékelni az egyes lapkákat, ami egyszer fontos lehet a játék elején, arra máskor csak a legvégén lesz szükség. A sorrend meghatározása ötletes (bár épp ezt a részt nem éreztem kiegyensúlyozottnak így kettesben, nem tudom más létszámnál hogy van). A szerencse szerepe nem nagy, a 7 akció sorsolásánál jelenik meg.
Összességében nem éreztem átütőnek így elsőre, de benne van még akár +1 pont is.
---
Másodjára már eggyel többen próbáltuk:) A Feld napon ez volt talán a legkevésbé ütős játék (bár a Notre Dame meg a Burgund mögött lemaradni nem szégyen:)). Helyesbítem a korábban leírtakat: a 7 akció sorsolásánál kifejezetten nagy a szerencse szerepe. Főleg ha nincs pénzünk. Érdekesség: egyik játékos épület és ember nélkül fejezte be a játékot.
2 játék alapján úgy tűnik, hogy aki a sorrend sávon utolsó, az a játékban nem nagyon nyerhet.
---
Feljavítottam ezt is a többi Feld pontszámára (már 5 db Feld van azonos pontszámmal:). Nagyon jó ez a játék! Az a 10 féle esemény hihetetlenül feldobja!
---
Átpontoztam a Feldeket, csak 3 db 8 pontost hagytam: Burgund, Dragon, Notre Dame. A Burgundba nem nagyon tudok belekötni, de a másik kettő az, amivel legszívesebben játszom.

In the middle of the game, we came to the conclusion that we played something wrong. You can skip an action and receive money. That makes sence. Before that I was completly blown away by not having any money and not able to do anything to protect me for the next rounds. I lost 3 or 4 people, and as I rusult of that I lost 2 buildings. A game can be hard, but I was feeling I was hit too much. In fact is was game over for me.  
But since this was something forgotten in the explanation of the rules and not a real flow in the rules themselves, I will give the game a second chance. Rating will be updated afterwards.

So we played again. Rating is upgraded. A small misunderstanding of the game rules, can break a game down. But this is a good Stefan Feld game!

RATING: 5
I enjoyed it but after my first play I have slight concerns that privileges may be too strong, I think investing heavily in them may prove to be a winning strategy, I'm not sure there are equally strong alternatives. If next plays will confirm those fears the rating will go down. On the other hand random order of catastrophies is a good idea to increase replayability and may have also a good effect to tune down fixed strategies.

I enjoy the planning aspect for overcoming events and scoring points!  However, if you choose the wrong starting characters, it's usually too difficult to get back into the game.  In the Year of the Dragon does feature a run-away leader problem if players fall behind in turn order or fail to see the importance of an early double privilege.  Being last in turn order is only a viable strategy if there is fierce competition for starting player amongst your competitors.  Perhaps your chances also depend on the order of events.  Although, the random grouping of actions provides a luck aspect, it also keeps the game from being solved.
 
The main downside to Year of the Dragon is the selection of starting characters.  I would prefer an auction format, but there is no official variant.  The other downside is that it can feel sort of scripted.

I created this unofficial variant in order to figure out the maximum number of points possible in a game and also to determine which actions/people were the biggest potential point generators.  It has been interesting comparing an early Double Privilege to a heavy Research strategy.  Perhaps Alan Kwan's double builder can outscore a Double Privilege?  Anyway, I have found that my scores in five player games have improved after attempting this variant.

The planning and tense decisions necessary in most good games are here in abundance. Each turn you have to maximize your own actions and plan for victory in a careful balancing act. I really enjoy a game with this type of planning, and both the components and gameplay here are what you would expect from an Alea game.

HOWEVER, the game totally starts to fall flat after a few plays as you realize that this game is nothing more than an exercise in avoiding pain, there is only one way to victory, and only  one person can manage it each round. Very annoying game, overall.

Love this game, almost no luck invovled.

Can be a bit brutal if off to a bad start, but even when losing its still fun to 'beat' the events and end up with lots of population (even if not maxxing on your score).

The game is brutal and punishing, but it is a joy to play.  I love games where planning ahead leads to success, and every move in this game is about planning ahead.  There is little confrontation, and players are basically playing the board instead of eachother.  The game is intense, but not in a confrontational way.  The outcome for me is that the game is relaxing to play while being strategic.  I know what disasters await, I know what tiles are on the board, and I know that all players are being equally punished by harsh China.  I really enjoy this one.

Magnificent game. The tension in the game runs from front to back, you always need just a little more than you have and the consequences of not having those things can be dire. Perhaps not knowing exactly what Murphy will throw at you would make the game even better.

This game is on my 'To Review List'. Watch this space.

The decision-making in this game is brutal.  In a fun way.  A good-humored group will enjoy laughing at each other and themselves as they try not to shoot themselves in the foot (repeatedly).  I imagine this game will get more cutthroat as people tune in to the stronger long-term strategies, but even then, it's as much a game of recovering from mistakes (which will inevitably be made) as it is a game to win.  Unusual Euro-game in that it is very unforgiving and sometimes bleak, but very fun to play, as well.  In many ways, I enjoy playing this one just for the fun of tactically surviving the disasters, rather than for the actual win.

Pretty fluent gameplay with enough choices to be made throughout the game. Different strategies are possible as there are a lot of ways to victory. It seems however that a mistake in the early game is almost impossible to correct. Very hard to catch up with the leader. Components are not very clear at first and some game terms seem farfetched. Needs more plays to see if the catching up problem is just due to inexperience.

My second game was worse than my first, but I think I know why. It seems to me you are not really free to just do whatever you want in this game. You MUST take the upcoming events into reality. In fact, should I play this a third time, my next strategy will be to always accommodate to the bad events first and then employ point gaining tactics. I still think its important to have money as an offset to turn order.For the moment I'm reducing my rating of this game down to a 6, but I will give it the opportunity to redeem itself with me.

Played this twice last night with 4 players. It was my seventh Feld game and so far I have pretty much loved all of them. Infact, I would have a very tough time ranking them individually - I clearly need to play them more!

Not only do I really enjoy Feld's games, I also seem to be quite good at them in general. I won both games last night. I employed somewhat similar strategies, but the two games still felt very different due to the randomness in setup which is a huge strength in almost every Stefan Feld game.

I also really appreciated the punishing feel of this. I like that you constantly have to avoid disaster. It makes for a more tense gaming experience than Felds more forgiving point salads where you just score points whatever you do.

So this game is definitely one I want to play more.

The game design is outstanding. It's deeply strategic, richly tactical, and has deceptively simple mechanics. Every player is on equal footing with the same hiring capabilities and perfect knowledge of how the events will unfold each turn. So throughout the course of the game there is almost zero luck at all. Your strategy must factor in the choices of your opponents at every turn, requiring you to shift tactically. To keep your strategy moving forward, maintaining a strong position on the turn order track and/or enough coins is essential. It's an unforgiving game where you must be prepared to lose what you have built up. It's tough, it's painful, and it is utterly FANTASTIC! Every turn you do 2 simple things:  choose an action and hire a person. And that's it. But it's amazingly deep and every single choice is agonizing.

Death, destruction... I do like the way all of the pieces work together and all of the options for scoring.  I like Peloponnes better after just one play for a game where the disasters are taking you down.  I took the conservative, non-building approach in my first attempt at this game and was completely demolished... and I mean completely.  I did well in my second game, but it was only 3 players and I think that made the game less tense.

Very nice, deep game in the best Alea tradition.
Its driving elements are very similar to those of Notre Dame (constrained actions aimed at accumulating some of the number of available resources only one of which is actually direct Victory Points) and yet it seems to play quite differently. 
One of the most appealing things about it is that it appears to be a well executed non abstract full information game.

A good game. Sold it after it got a bit old, after a dozen or so plays. The disasters is the interesting part, the way you make VPs is significantly less interesting.

Maybe it's replay value gets better with the expansion, but since it's sold with 6 other expansions for games I don't and will not own, I guess I'll never know.

2 plays.  Weird game.  Interesting but annoying.  Few (or zero) good options unless you're going 1st or 2nd in the turn order.  Seems like you versus the game and then versus the players... because it can be very difficult to get what you need/want.  Everybody has almost the same potential except for the 2 wild cards and the choice of the initial 2 tiles.  If you get crap for action choices during the rounds, you can easily find yourself forced to use wild cards in a less than optimal fashion.  UPDATE:  I'm really not liking the way the tiles come out... it's too random and too few choices for good things to do on your turn.  In this regard, I agree with other comments that this game is about pain management... and it seems like only one person per round (the one going 1st) can avoid the pain by getting to choose a good tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Not one you'll get to grips with straight away, as you have a number of tiles to collect which have to be deployed to defeat a number of disasters that befall everyone, one at the end of each round. There's a "worker placement" aspect as the there is a role selection, boosted by any tiles you have, to get you food, healers, buildings, warriors, money, VPs or advances on the turn order track. You have to balance all that to get to win.

Game of managing misery. Not a game for everyone because of the feeling that for each step forward you'll take two steps back. Player order is super important, but accomplishing that means giving up options you don't want to lose. I haven't played Trajan yet, but so far this is easily the best Feld game I've played.

After several plays I have the nagging sense that when playing with experienced players, luck becomes more of a factor because of how the tiles are distributed. It becomes a really cutthroat game then with five players.

It is totally different Feld then I used to play before. In this one Your fighting against the game and other players also. There is small amount of components inside the box but during the game You feel that there is a lot of stuff/decisions You have to/make do to survive. Very difficult game to master, takes time to fully enjoy the game. This is another game by Feld where if You stop planning and thinking "what should I do in next two turns" You can be sure You lose ;) 

It is very difficult to find copy of this game nowadays.

Picked up in a math trade on a whim.  It's still sitting unplayed in the cabinet.  Yet another game to try and get on the table soon.

I really don't see anything amazing about this game.  It's supposed to be about making hard decisions, but that is not exactly an uncommon thing in modern games.  The mechansisms are not particularly well integrated or inspiring.  I'll try this one with my wife, but if she's not crazy about it this will wander off to the trade pile.

Funish role selection game. Didn't worry about trying to get first on initiative track and got both of the 2 stone monks on 3 tier buildings. got 30 points at end for that but needed to get scrolls earlier on in the game. Came in 3rd by 2 points in 3 player game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Disappointed with this one, glad I tried before buying! Could see it really suffering from analysis paralysis. Very dry and little player interaction, you're all just dealing with your own little empire trying to survive and score vps, only interaction is taking a power that someone else might want (so costing them 3 cash) or taking the last noble that they needed, but really you'll be struggling to do your thing to such an extent picking stuff negatively to hurt another isn't going to be a major factor unless you're playing 2 player.
Game felt tedious, I really didn't care who was going to win, but the 4th season I just wanted it over - more of a puzzle than a game. I'm sure fans of multi-solo puzzle type games will love this, I don't.

RATING: 8
Interesting game on with a Chinese theme.

I like the balance of the game although when starting to play it wasn't readily evident.  You shouldn't get too attached to those peasant classes that is for sure.  (Completely expendable I say!) If you wanna try to spend an early six coins and purchase make an VP engine, getting that working for you and a courtesan to tic up VPs also, that will get you 20-36 points at least by end game between the two mechanics.  Another good scoring path is to be sure to have some monks(buddahs) in a 3 story temple for the nice VP mulitiplier which could get you maybe 6-15 more.  

The game could be vastly different depending on players.  To me the farmers and doctors seemed to be the most expendable.  Fireworks will be scored 3 times so its nice to have a little pile off to the side.

RATING: 2
First (and last) game of this was a disaster for me, leaving me nothing to do for the last five or six turns.  Fortunately, two of the other three players were not impressed either, so I won't have to suffer through this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An interesting game of disaster management.  So far I've only played the game with 2 players.  I imagine with 4 or 5 the level of difficulty will increase tremendously.

While there is some resource management, the real meat of the game is your ability to plan several turns in the future.  While the order of trials is known to all, players constantly have to adjust as the actions and personnel available change.  Plan well and you'll do all right.  Especially if you're making moves that will benefit you 2-3 turns in the future.  Fall behind or barely tread water and the game will drain you of your resources faster which results in severe penalties.

Overall the game is very euro however it doesn't feel stale or overly scripted.  The rules give you enough latitude to determine your own fate.  Also the scoring rules don't feel like they artificially keep the game close.  Good planners reap the benefits, bad planners suffer the consequences.

I rate the game at a 6.5.  Interesting challenges, nice theme, not much interaction and a little bit of fun.  I would like to play it again especially with 4-5 players.

*edit*  With more plays I've upped my opinion of the game.  There are more paths to victory than I first believed and its one of Feld's better designs.  Also 4p and 5p are best.

Feld's second contribution to the Big Box series is a worthy addition IMO. It shares some qualities with the previous Notre Dame, but playwise executes much differently. Playing this feels somewhat akin to Citadels, not that it uses role-selection, but feels like a lesser form of that mechanic via the purchase of supporting personalities to maximize your gains or minimize your losses. The Asian theme is well-rendered and beautiful. Also like the addition of the "initiative track" to determine turn order. Another solid middleweight from Feld.

It would rate a "9.5" if it wasn't for the double privilege being too powerful.

My favourite from Essen 07. It is decidedly a very good euro. Not enough resources to cover one's basis. You WILL suffer loss. A great planning game. This is a game of crisis anticipation & management!

This game can be very unforgiving. One misstep can trigger a cascade of total destruction. (I can personally attest to that one!) Brutal, engaging and addictive.

Very little luck (except for the division of the 7 actions) to ruin one's game, just decisions to minimize the misfortunes of disease, drought, the Mongols and the demands of the emperor.

Brilliantly replayable. The event order ensures this. Additionally, strategy changes depending on the event order and the actions & strategies of the other players.

Having played 3, 4 and 5 player games, Im Jahr des Drachen scaled well to all. And it is quite quick to play. (15 minutes per player)

Definitely Stefan Feld's best title to date (October 2007).

Update: I have increased the rating because it has been so well received by so many people at the game club that I play at. 

Second update: Decrease from 9 -> 8: though there are multiple paths to victory; the one major weakness in the design of the game is that a double privilege purchased in round #1 is very hard to beat. Despite trying multiple paths to victory, there is a heavy bias to the dominant strategy of buying a double privilege in round one. After 20 plays, it has lost its replayability because of this one issue.

Third Update: Have played with the Schatzkiste expansion (Great Wall and Super Event). Makes a tough game even more punishing. However, it doesn't fix the broken first-turn double privilege. It may have introduced a new problem. Playing the front constantly and building the wall seems to be a dominant strategy.

Fourth Update: We played with a variant wherein the first round, anyone may purchase the double privilege for 6 yuan. This seems to (mostly) fix the broken double privilege.

Fifth Update (June 2017): new official rules that a double privilege is $7. Seems to fix the one "broken" aspect to the original design over the past 10 years. Now bumped up to 9.5

It actually reminds me a bit of Agricola.  You have limited turns, and you need to grow your "family", while also providing for them by protecting/feeding them.  At the same time you need to be working out ways to get victory points.  Game makes me think of Chinese food and makes me hungry. Mmmm... chicken chow mein!  EDIT Jan 08: knocking the rating down a notch to 6.  This game just feels like work to me.  I feel like I need a good vacation when I'm done playing... with tropical drinks.

I got mine at BGG con 2007. Very exciting game of damage control.  Last time I played the winner basically slit his own throat to get ahead and finished with only one person in one palace!  The variable setup will make each game different and the second game I played was much more brutal than the first based on the way the events came out.

RATING: 7.5
I'm really falling for the Alea big box series.  So elegant, so classy, so deep.  I was scared off from buying this one for a while due to the constant reports of "It sucks with 2," but after digging deeper I found others disagreed with that, so gave it a try.  Glad I did!  Everyone talks about how cutthroat this is for a Euro, but I don't find it so bad - with more, yes, it could get dicey, but with two it turns into more of an intense brain-burn.  Very well balanced, and the random distribution of the calamities makes every game different.  A nice, quick play with just 2 as well.  Highly recommended if you like Euros.

RATING: 7
Nice game with some interesting elements. It does have some random elements, but like other great games, the random mechanics strike everyone equally. Takes a lot of thought and planning however, so not a good one to play when your one friend who takes really long turns is over.

RATING: 6
A tense, thought-provoking, and somewhat depressing experience. "Oh you mean, in the next two rounds I have to kill two of my people and lose a building? And there's nothing I can do to stop it? And that's normal and I should just plan future turns accordingly?" Wow. What fun.

Actually, it is a very good game with lots of strategic planning and an auction mechanism that can throw a wrench in even the best laid plans. I don't mind these kinds of "engine destroying" games as long as everyone on board is OK with it, but make sure your group knows this before starting. It can be pretty unforgiving.

Just an update as I realize I've crossed the magic 10-play threshold on this one a while ago - I do like Year of the Dragon a lot, and it's by far my favorite of Stefan Feld's games. Clean-playing yet reasonably thematic, with lots of good tensions, this is definitely a winner.

The two expansions in the alea Treasure Chest seem pretty good too.

Good fun, I enjoyed this more than I expected. I wasn't a huge fan of Notre  Dame, and in general I've felt like alea's big-box quality has been losing traction for a while. But this was very good, and not what I expected given the buzz. There is a fair amount of calamity, but it's not nearly the disaster management game the buzz has made it out to be. Sure, the repeated crises are what makes the game interesting, but you build up faster than you get cut down, so it's still a pretty rewarding building game. And it's definitely more substantive than some of the other highly-derivative, overwrought worker placement games we've been seeing of late (Cuba, Agricola); it manages to do a lot with a very clean game system, and have good depth without excessive play-time or pacing issues. In short, what we've come to love about alea. Time will tell, but the first impression is that this is a winner, and perhaps the most interesting and broadly appealing game in the line since Puerto Rico (I personally liked 5th Avenue better, but I realize that I'm on my own on that one). Of course, the line has been a bit soft since then.

If no one had told me the designer, I'd have guessed this was a Martin Wallace game since the game is very punishing!

I love games with hard decisions.  This is definitely one where at some point in the game everyone will need to sacrifive their hard won villagers.  "Okay folks, two of you need to die.

Played once, 2-player, but by the wrong rules.  I didn't enjoy it much, and can't imagine that the right rules will change that.  Mechanically, the choices didn't seem particularly hard or interesting.  Thematically, it doesn't really feel like I'm doing anything at all.  Meh.  

I'd try it one more time, but if this is a classic Stephen Feld game, you can count me out for his future offerings.

RATING: 7
Stefan Feld continues to impress with the next of the Alea series. Shades of Notre Dame where there are good things and negative things around every corner. Ignore these at your peril in this game as failing to cope with these bad turn of events will crush your gameplan and final score. 6 Plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The gameplay is fluid. The interaction is not huge, but alright, just for fireworks and soldiers.
The theme is not as bad as I thought, though the board could have been a bit less abstract.
I like the artwork.
But the best is of course this feeling that you have to protect your people against the need to score victory points.
Most games are usually VP oriented, some are protection-oriented (Shadows, Zombie games) but it's good to have one with a mix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyed the events being randomized during setup, gives me the impression that I can't walk into the game with a plan, I have to formulate my plan after the setup is shown. However, I am wary, as more plays might reveal that as far as VPs go, there is a best strategy, and that only your disaster mitigation strategy changes from game to game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 2 players: Want to try this with more people, but it actually seems to work fairly well with just two. Very typical Euro, but heavy on the risk management. Lots of tension as you have to prepare for disaster every turn (and since the Action phase comes before the People phase, you are forced to think at least a turn ahead.) Since the events are random there's enough luck to keep it from getting stale, but since they're all laid out from the start this doesn't sacrifice long-term planning.

Just feels a little... dry. I wouldn't recommend this over many other Euros.

This game is fairly themeless, but I like it.  You have perfect knowledge of everything, except the actions of the other players, from the beginning of the game, and so your success depends on your ability in strategic planning.  This game is difficult for first time players and often the decisions aren't all that interesting, but I do like the feeling of accomplishment that a good showing in this game provides.

The game I wanted Notre Dame to be. The turn-order track/action selection mechanism provides the feeling of interaction/competition that Notre Dame lacked. Also, planning is necessary, but it still has a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants feel to it, which I love. 
Starting to feel worried that the 2-privilege on turn 1 is an overpowered, and worse, lazy play.

Rating based on a 3 player game.  There is definately a sense of multiple paths to victory but I'm not sure how viable the paths are opposed to just keeping your guys alive.  The main decisions are when to bring in your people and you probably want to do that right before you need to execute an action they augment.  Having a big lead on the initiative track can save you gold, but its not a game winner - far mor important is getting your 1pt person and a point chit early in the game to rack up those points multiple times.  I felt like the decisions were not that meaty and my best move was mostly always obvious, though this could change with repeated plays as hopefully a greater depth will reveal itself.

Really enjoy this game, but I haven't played it recently enough to adequately comment, especially considering that we've got the rules right 0/3 times, and on some pretty major issues.  It's distinctly possible I won't care for it according to the rules.

RATING: 6
Rated "8" after one play. Very efficient game, where each turn you have 4 things you want to do... and one choice. It strikes me as a "worker placement" game, but you have only one worker. 

On the one hand, this will feel fairly familiar to anyone that plays plenty of Euro games, but what stands out after one play is the variety of ways to try and score, as well as one of the best approaches I've seen regarding turn order. Turn order is pretty critical. The game offers a separate turn order track that balances the ability to go first vs. gaining a premium on other rescources. Pretty neat game, and I can see myself picking this up at some point.

Update: Well, I picked it up, but it sat on the shelf for a while. I finally got in a 2nd play, and it's still solid. There's nothing terribly standout about the game, but I'm increasingly enjoying harsh systems or "games of survival," and ItYofD offers that in spades, along with the chance to do plenty of forward planning.

Update: a 3d play, and I'm liking this even a little more. This is a solid 8. Each game has felt a little different, and there's just a ton of game in a relatively manageable time frame and ruleset.

Update: well, my feelings on this one dropped and I ultimately traded it away. Two things bugged me. Regarding turn order, you're either sitting pretty in first, barely hanging on in 2nd, or totally hammered in anything later. Also, I just don't like the privileges. It's been the no-brainer choice in the groups I've played, and though there may be answers to it, it's simply not fun.

Very, very similar to Notre Dame. Same premise of trying to keep your head above water while the game tries to dunk you under from all sides. I prefer Notre Dame because you can recover fairly quickly if you make a mistake whereas here you can suffer for turns and turns. Also, this game has perfect information and, too my mind, less player interaction which I think will cut into the replayability.

UPDATE: Perhaps this is better then Notre Dame after all. One thing I dislike in this game is that you have to choose a strategy (high influence, builder, scholar) very early in the game and stick to it.

Im Jahr des Drachen is the newest alea game, so of course it had to be on my play list. Stefan Feld is apparently alea's in-house designer as of late, and I enjoy both of his previous games, Und Ru(h)m und Ehre and Notre Dame. I think Im Jahr is the best of his alea series to date though.

Im Jahr is a game of adversity. At the most baseline level, you're trying to build buildings, get people to put in them, and keep everyone alive. This is made difficult in various ways by the Cossacks (Mongols actually, but the swords look Cossack-like), the plague, droughts (with damage prevented by coarse-ground cocaine tacos), and the incredibly deadly king/emperor/ruler type of your choice (who will kill many more people than the Cossacks if you fail to grovel adequately).

Each round is based on two major halves. The first half, each player can select an action from a menu of X where X is equal to the number of players. Multiple people can select the same action, but they have to pony 3 bucks if someone else is already there. The actions each give you things like victory points, or chips that generate victory points, or chips which help you to avoid unpleasant events.

The second part of the game involves drafting personality tiles off the board. These tiles allow the actions you take in the first half of each round to be more efficient. They also give you points on the sub-track, which determines player order, and which tends to be very important if you aren't rolling in the cash.

After that, an event occurs, most of which are negative, and most of which involve losing people if you can't fend it off. The events are all laid out at the start of the game, so you can see what is coming, and everyone is likely to be dinged by something at some point in time. 

The end game scoring is the usual alea mish-mash with a tonne of things generating VPs, i.e.: the buildings you have put up, the number of people you have, points you've accrued throughout the game for having buildings, points you've accrued throughout the game for having bonus point scrolls, &c.

I think this game fits together well, and I enjoy the tough choices and the ability to look ahead at the events and craft a game length strategy. In some senses, people have been comparing it to Notre Dame in that it is a game where it is nice to have strong infrastructures in place so that one can take actions with increased efficiency and get a bigger return, but it's impossible to do everything well, and the order the events come out in seems like it will dictate some strategic choices.

My only real reservation about this game is my feeling that with a cash heavy infrastructure (i.e.: a couple of the coin-makers) you can almost ignore what the other players are doing. The only real interaction in the game is based on the battle for scarce actions, which is the major angst in the first half of the round, and also partially dictates person tile choice in the second. Cash allows you to effectively buy the action you want for 3, and to take the person tiles you want without paying much attention to the turn order sub-track. Not every game will make cash a sound choice, so this is a niggle, but so it goes. 

I like the game though, and I would like to play it some more to form a more solid opinion on it. This might have a hard ceiling on it where players can craft certain strategies for certain event sequences (i.e.: when this event occurs early do this...&c.) but that's complete speculation on my part. At this point, I enjoy, would be willing to play it anytime, but don't need to own it. 7 for starters.

Likes: You must build and expand your palace, but also have to deal with all the upcoming disasters by hiring people. Everyone's doing the same, but the player order is a dynamic track that depends on the strength of people hired. The theme is awesome.

I have fun with this game. Yes, it is tough and very brutal game. If you fall behind you can pretty much bet you are going to stay behind. But if you go into the game knowing these things and all players understand this, I found it really enjoyable. Also, if everyone has played the game before, it really speeds up. Another bonus is that this game is not that AP prone as everyone takes their turn almost at the same time. This was much better the second time we played.

6/12/12:  Traded for Duel In the Dark + Duel of the Giants in No Cultists MT.

I'm sorry to see this game go.  I like it, but it doesn't interest my usual gaming friends so it tends not to hit the table much.  It isn't very good with two.  Hopefully the two Duel... games will be better.

Earlier:
When I first opened the box and readied the game for play I thought that the pieces and art were very nice.  A couple of turns in found me annoyed that the action cards, events, and people didn't reference each other more directly.  In other words, the art was enjoyable but did not help me to tie together which pieces helped with which pieces.  The game play was interesting.  I got a hard lesson early on to watch which people remain available when my opponent swiped all but one healer early in the game.  

With two people the game is okay.  I'm wondering if it plays better with more.  We didn't find the choices all that difficult to make nor did we work very hard to avoid losing people or palace floors.  It left me feeling like I'd missed key strategies.

ETA: the game is better with 5.  Competition made decisions tighter and more challenging.

ETA: better still with 3.

This was once a favourite of mine and I still like it a lot. One constantly feels under pressure and without enough time to prepare for the events that just keep coming. The starting player score track adds a dimension that I like and there are several other aspects that need to be considered which provide for lots of thinking and enjoyment but it is by no means so chaotic as to be a lottery; good strategy will win the day (or at least give one a competitive score).

Update: Finally played again. This time I was very clear about what was going on, and still didn't manage to win. In fact [i]again[/i] someone playing for the first time won. But I enjoyed the game even more. Really solid, as far as "the winner is the player that gets the crap beat out of them least" games go. What's apparent, is that there are many different strategies and they are greatly affected by setup, but you can also shift strategies during the game. Both of which I like. I see enough possibilities to provide plenty of opportunities to try different ideas.

RATING: 6
This game is... how to put this... well, a dichotomy. On the one hand we have a game which is as much about creating an engine as it is about tearing it down in a controlled fashion. This is a very rare mechanism; I feel it is hardly ever used because gamers don't like to tear down things. They want to build, extend, engulf, etcetera. Nevertheless, IJdD flies in the face of conventional wisdom. And manages to pull it off quite well, certainly better than any other game I know. Which I admit isn't saying much due to an apparent lack of competition, but still if you are looking for this sort of thing then IJdD is your game.

Second plus is that IJdD is also very strongly about turn order manipulation. Stefan Feld uses the principle in almost all of his later games, but nowhere is the matter so explicit and central as in this game. It is horrendously expensive to go last all the time, and much of the game is weighing up the cost of being able to select first against the benefit of spending resources elsewhere to greater effort. The game is rather relentless here, which is unusual in its indirect interactive power. This is not a nice game where everyone can do whatever he pleases.

But... there is a downside, and that is that it turns out that you are played by the other players a bit too often in my opinion. Because resources are scarce in this game there will be times when you simply have no alternative, and certainly no creative alternative, to pick a certain action. It can be argued that minimising the consequences is precisely what IJdD is about, and I would agree. But that is not the point: the point is that the above simply cannot be avoided, and the result is the feeling of a straightjacket from which there is no escape until your opponents losen up the belts. Granted, you'll likely return the favour at some point, but still. I've played the title a handful of times now, and I still don't like how I'm being shackled thusly. It makes my participation feel pointless, and I dislike that intensely.

So all in all there are good reasons to like IJdD, but for me there is also good reason to dislike the game. Hence the dichotomy I alluded to earlier, and hence the ambiguous rate I've given the game. Still, the title is good in its own right and worthy of a trial run or two if you haven't yet played it. And if you worry about finding yet another point salad thingie: not here. This design goes back to the time when Feld was doing things rather differently. Apart from the turn order mechanism there is very little which would give away that Stefan is the author of IJdD.

RATING: 6
F'n Great!  A bit of luck, but not enough to skew the results by much, generally (and any "screw factor" can be negated by using certain strategies).  Diverse strategies that are still effective, loads of player interaction without being too easy to destroy opponent's strategies, lots of decisions, lots of tough decisions... what more could you want?

2011 Edit: I need to drop this guy's rating from where I originally had it.  High initiative mass-build is simply too good, and dominates the strategy.  The question is, do I give it a 7 based on the time it was interesting for, or a 5 for where I'd put it now?  I'll compromise and give it a 6.

Acquired July 2008.

Have played it a handful of times since and really enjoy it.  Different enough to keep both Notre Dame and this one.  I'm not very good at this game, but it is a lot of fun.

Feels like a puzzle at first, but then you realize that it is all about weakening your opponent and what they need.

Initial rating is an 8 but feel this will head upwards.

Dec 2008 - Moved to a 9.  Played this a ton of times online but still haven't won it.  For some reason, it is very difficult for me to master this one.  I want to know why.  Very challenging.

March 2010 - I'm getting this one now.  Can play it fairly well when played online.  Wish I could play it more face-to-face.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Muy parecido al Notre Dame pero su mecánica es llevada por otros derroteros.

Visto lo visto y haciéndome unos pequeños cálculos de diseño, me parecería muy buena opción no permitir comprar el privilegio doble durante el primer turno (al igual que no se pueden coger los personajes viejos en los personajes iniciales) restringirlo un turno no es gran cosa. Seguramente esté un pelín - y tan solo un pelín desequilibrado el poderlo hacerlo durante esta primera ronda, por eso lo de la estrategia dominante. Admito que pueden haber metido la pata. Yo lo aconsejo restringirlo. Mi argumento básico es sencillo, así hay 15 veces más de posibles combinaciones comparadas con las combinaciones de las dos fichas iniciales, las cuales no son muchas. De esta manera, teóricamente, se puede competir sobradamente contra la estrategia ganadora, teniendo al menos un turno para ello, a parte de los personajes iniciales.[/COLOR]

Feld with fewer bells and whistles. Nice theme integration, nice variety with the variable event sequence. One of my favorite medium Euros.

I have a feeling this rating will rise after multiple plays, BUT here is why I rated the game so low, and why it probably will never go beyond a 6.5/7:

There are games on a learning curve, then there is Year of the Dragon.  All information is perfect information; there is no real luck factor in this game.To me, the only way this game could be enjoyable is if everyone was at the same skill level.  There is a lot of blocking and player "screwage", so the player that gets messed with the least could more than likely win most of the time.

The positive:  The tension and screwage part of the game.  (But it is a double edged sword).

For newbies:  I reccomend: http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/23763/page/7

I would really like this game but for two things:  (1) Buying the double dragon on turn 1 seems pretty broken; and (2) 2 player is kind of boring. 

Besides that, it's a euro, pretty standard and soulless, but plays fairly quickly. 

But really, the double-dragon thing is annoying. The game lasts twelve rounds, so it's a 24-point buy on the first turn. Why can't we have better play-testers? (see A Few Acres of Snow, Eclipse plasma missiles, etc.).

You (the players) are Chinese rulers, and the next 12 months (turns) you will encounter droughts, Mongol attacks, sickness, and other events. Fortunately you know when these events will happen. So, hire the right personnel at the given moment, and let those farmers grow rice before the drought, have those soldiers protect your palace, and get docters to heal the sick, or suffer the consequences. Oh, yes. To house that personnel, you need carpenters to enlarge your palace.

Some workers are more efficient then others, but those let you loose initiative in the selection of the action that one of your workers will do that turn. 

Nicely themed and challenging game. Since I only played it once, I don't know about the replayability. But I look forward playing it again.

Very good game.  It has a lot of options, without too many rules or components.  The decisions and trade-offs have a lot of implications.  It's all about risk management with many ways to build your engine.  Resources are very scarce in the game.  Something I underestimated much to my demise.  I think this one would replay very well.  Hopefully I get a chance to find out.

RATING: 7
The method of selecting actions, soft-locking others out of them (since they can be paid for after having been previously selected) and

The cut-throat nature makes it a very interactive game - there's always competition whether for picking your starting people, selecting actions or trying to have the most fireworks and not the least armies.

The rules seemed a bit fiddly - it took me a while to understand what was going on, finally realising that people do nothing by themselves - only with actions or events do they have benefit - and Ian using 'gold' to mean 'unit of money' when there are silver/gold pieces aided my confusion. Even after the game, I still felt a bit shaky about a couple of things.

I'm sure I'll enjoy it more after getting to grips with the rules.

There's definitely a LOT of potential for cutthroat interaction, despite it all being technically indirect and that's something that will surely give the game lasting power.

After several plays on MabiWeb and a few goes with the flash version, I've decided this game is far too frustrating to be considered fun.  It's almost impossible to stop a run away leader.  And even though the scoring track indicates someone way out in front, it's hard to tell where you stand in the game.

Turn order is of very high importance and jockeying for turn order will influence most of the characters that get selected in the beginning, generally without regard to events.  

Nearly impossible to recover from a mistake and I thank God for the flash version as I can simply shut it down and restart.

Yet another well balanced, nice looking euro vp engine game.  This one has some interesting, punishing bells and whistles which set it apart. However, it still has that communal optimization aspect that gets old with euros now.  At the end all actions seem to yield the same VP for many players, which means its too balanced. First game someone ran away with books despite having no balance to their civ which wa sfrsutarting. I'm callingit Notre Dam-heavy. A good game I want to play more but uninspiring.

Love this game.  It's painful on every player - you basically minimize the disasters and it's unavoidable.  Fun to watch a player go down hard and get whacked....but you will suffer too in some way. Cool mechanics with the turn track to keep control of going first - you must balance this - you can take stronger characters that help, but you'll fall behind on the track; tons of different strategies and never boring because the disaster tiles are random every game.

This is a good design and it probably deserves a higher rating, but the key differentiating factor of this game is the damage control, which I don't really enjoy planning for. Players are building victory point engines, but these engines are blown to pieces if players don't properly plan for the disasters, such as famine, Mongol hordes, and such. It's all a bit depressing, really, but it is a good design.

I do like games that have you surfing random disasters and this fits the bill, though its a bit strange knowing the disaster sequence well in advance. (How nice of the mongols to stick to a schedule.)
There's plenty of tough choices all through this game. Besides the obvious choices of workers and tasks, the overlay of how much to compete with others for what you need vs taking your lumps with the leftovers is deliciously nasty.
A much quicker game than I expected it to be, but then there's not that much to it. Just a beating heart of tense choices.

The person track is a fine way to handle the turn order problem in worker placement games. You must choose between tiles that improve your place in the order and tiles that cope better with the disasters. Speaking of the disasters, I think the Sisyphean aspects of this game have been overstated; you can see each disaster coming and decide how much of a hit to take.

There are many ways to win. One of them is to prepare for each event/disaster, building palaces and saving the people.
Another one is to invest in privileges and scholars, what gives many victory points, but also you have to sacrifice your people.

I've only played this game twice, but both times have been very enjoyable.  The game is very clean and has few exceptions.  So it is fun on your first game and also has enough depth to keep you interested in future games.  Even though the game favors clean mechanics over theme, it still does a good job of invoking a theme.   I'm a little worried that I will enjoy it for another 5 games, and then it will feel old.  It all depends on how much variation the set-up of the "end of round" tiles provides.  As for now, this is one of my favorite new games (1/27/2008).  It feels a little bit like Notre Dame (not surprisingly).  My only grip is that I can usually see who is going to win several rounds before the end of the game.  So I play with the inevitable feeling of doom approaching, and there is nothing I can do to change it (this being with the games where there is nothing I can do to catch up).  Some sort of hidden scoring would have solved this problem.  Then I would have had the sense of an inevitable doom approaching mixed with a tinge of hope.

If you have to play a MPS game, then at least play one that is really really hard.  Gains a point for the varied starting team mechanic, but then loses one for the possibility of a death spiral that will absolutely and unavoidably cause you to lose everything you have.  Only thing worse than solitaire is watching other people play solitaire for two hours.  Four has more conflict than 5 since more actions will be doubled up on.

After 1 play, I'm starting this out at a 7.  It's gives you some interesting choices.  Half of the game is selecting a role ala Puerto Rico, but only you get to take the action.  The other half is recruiting a "person".  The "person" gives you bonus resources when its corresponding action is taken.  Those resources, in general, generate your VPs.  On the negative, I couldn't really explain the theme to you or what it all really means.  Recruit some dudes into your buildings, avoid losing dudes to disasters, use those dudes to generate VPs (and make space for more dudes).  So the "7" I give it now is because it is new, and I want to play it again.  After a few more plays, I expect the itch to be sufficiently scratched...and the game drop to a 6.

After I purchased Puerto Rico I acquired In the Year of the Dragon. 

In the Year of the Dragon was a delightful game of brutality and overcoming constant hardship. Unfortunately its intricacies were a bit much for most of the people I taught it to, and even after they learned it reasonably well many of them didn't enjoy the constant crushing despair of having to struggle with the endless disasters that the year brought. The most persistent foe of it is my girlfriend, and since I frequently end up playing games with her, the opposition she expressed prevents it from making it to the table. So despite my enjoyment of the game, it eventually fell to the wayside and I have not played it in many months.

Players represent Chinese nobles, claiming prestige and avoiding bad events.  Players take turns drafting actions from a "slice the pie" selection.  Then they get to recruit a person into their palace, who confer abilities to help them deal with events.  Finally, the game turn event triggers which usually means bad things if the players are not prepared.  Prestige (victory) points are awarded for palaces, and a few other things at the end of each turn.  Most points wins.  Interesting, if rather derivative game, that feels rather brutal if players don't plan carefully.  Feels two steps forward, one step back at times.  I'm starting the think the "action selection" mechanic is getter a bit over-wrought now, but as a game, there's nothing wrong with it.  Good game.

Ultimately a bone-dry game of competing nobles scoring in multiple paths to a presige victory.  Very even-handed in its resources available to players, as everyone will take same number of actions, see the same look-ahead info, and has the same hand of cards to use. Yet ultimately just a long series of unsatisfying reactions to  random card deals and fickle decisions by your opponents.

Interesting management & turn order mechanics. The strategy I developed on my first play was a bit broken because of the order of the disaster tiles. It feels limited, and you pretty much get stuck with a particular strategy after the first couple rounds. I don't like that.

This is a neat game by the same designer as Notre Dame.  It didn't hit me the same way Notre Dame did after the first play, but I certainly see how this game is well designed and caters well to many plays.  I definitely didn't "get it" the first time, but after playing it again I'm starting to see how it comes together, and now I'm pretty excited about this one.  I also think my wife will like it.

Another shortage game, quite similar to Notre Dame (by the same designer).   This one is a little heavier and longer - which for a game of damage control might not necessarily be a good thing, unless you like that flavor of tension.   You build up your palaces, people and money, only to lose it to disaster many of the turns.   It's also a bit of a race as everyone is competing for the same things.  Can be frustrating, but can be fun.

What saves this game from being a multi-player solitaire is the fight for the turn order. 

I basically have 2 strategies that I use over and over again, with some adjustments for the event orders.

it does play well with 5... raised my rating from 8 to 8.5

great little game (the last time clocked at 75 mins). only time will tell if it holds up.

in short a clean, well made (refined) game... highly recommend

An excellent euro that has all players scrambling to survive upcoming disasters. The scoring is always close and the game is a real struggle right to the end. Plays well with 4-5 players and has everyone working together to survive while stealing actions from each other to do so. Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart. Some players will get completely devastated by this game. That said, I've won with many temples full of people and I've won with all but 3 people discarded due to one event or another. If teaching first time players, perhaps consider curating the events and explaining to them how to prepare for what is coming.

60-90m, best with 4-5 players. 10+ plays.

2017-08-08 : Quick playing engine builder where timing and order of execution is very important. It's an unforgiving game where 1 bad move can ruin your game, but that's also its attraction : you play on the edge all the time. While not a complex game, the layout could have made this a lot easier to play : the end of turn events should have had icons on them depicting conditions and consequences and the same goes for the various people you recruit, the cards etc. A missed chance to make this a 10 game.

I think someone explained it best when they said: it's a euro with a body count.  This is a thought-provoking game of managing the upcoming disasters while trying to get victory points.  There seems to be a few different paths to victory and the initiative for round order through the influence track keeps things interesting.  The game seems to be a little flawed when you consider the double privilege opener which is possible to defeat but hard.

Edit: Get the 10th Anniversary Edition of the game. It includes expansions from the Alea Treasure Chest and has re-balanced the Double Privilege cost to something more reasonable. It makes me want to re-purchase this one.

Learned and played at a mini-meet.  Strategies were pretty easy to grasp by focusing on the upcoming events although I wasn't sure at the beginning of what some of the workers were good for.  The gameplay is a bit repetitive and tedious and the attrition is brutal.  Not a beautiful production component-wise and only good as a multiplayer game in order to have good tension for the action selection phase.  I did OK, and sacrificed people some months, but this didn't WOW me either.  Brain-burning, engaging, long--although it didn't feel long (however, we did break at the mid-point to eat).  Bottom line for me--not a real FUN experience.  I might play again if asked and there is nothing else to spark my interest, but I won't suggest it or buy it.

RATING: 6
In the Year of the Dragon might be the most surprisingly oppressive game I've played. I did not expect this game to so easily, nor so often, back me into a corner, and I quickly realized that a strong early game is crucial. This game is all about assessing the events, and creating a careful plan of averting disaster. With only twelve actions at your disposal, one misstep or loss of focus could spell disaster. Though not a point-salad as is Feld's preference, this game instead relies on complex connections between various decisions; take an old worker, who is more proficient, but fall behind in player order; or take a points action, but forgo useful resources. It falls in on odd space of games that are easy to teach, but highly punishing for new players, which certainly detracts from its appeal.

Played twice.  A very good game, but it's one that will beat you up and take away your lunch money.  The primary tension comes from the fact that you know what "disasters" are coming up, and in what order, and that you can't cover them all.  It's more a matter of what to lose, and when.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the game a lot.  You have an awful lot of strategy decisions to make during the game, but the 2 dragon scroll seems pretty unbalanced.  You sort of have to buy it within the first few turns to remain competitive.  It seems to me that this puts at least 2 players out of the game by turn 3 in a 5 player game.  That's pretty bad for a game that lasts 12 turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
What stands out for me in this game is turn order being a commodity. This is done well, but it's not enough for me to get excited about it. Because of the "destructive" nature of the game I don't really have the feeling of "my stuff/subjects". A great game design & theme, but the flavor of play isn't me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Classic Feld. Manage a couple resources in a tight economy with constant conflict provided not from the other players but from the game itself. Just about every Feld game relies on a turn order mechanic that involves moving a disk along a path, with the person on top going first. In ItYoD this mechanic is excellently used. A player needs to balance between going first and recruiting the players that will help the most. Frustratingly enjoyable. Stephan Feld sells frustration in a box.

RATING: 8
I am rating this as a 2-player game.

I have played 50+ times with my wife, and am surprised at the depth of strategy it has - we are still exploring. Feels a little bit like Caylus, in that it is tight and brutal efficiency game, but shorter and not as intense. The tactics are not as complex as in Caylus, and there is a bit of luck, but it really packs a lot of interest into something that plays in just over half an hour.  

12-1-2012  Somehow this has lost just a little bit of its shine for me recently.  It's still a good game, but probably not quite an 8.  Down to 7.5

2-8-2014 Actually, it's still shining.  Not quite sure why - maybe it's the occasional 4 player game we've gotten in, which is even better.  It really is a good game - I don't know of anything else that offers quite so much in the same playtime.

Meaty eurogame that gives you lots to think about. It's a challenging game of "constant management". It didn't come across as being as intuitive as other Eurogames, e.g., Aladdin's Dragons, Amun-Re etc. I think the theme integration is not as well done here, making it hard to "get" the game.

Highly procedural, to the extent that the supposed angst from negative events didn't feel very angsty to me.  This is a common thread in every Feld game - this is what passes for chaos for high-control players.  The structure doesn't require you to shift strategy on the fly much, rather it just throws some hazards in the route, which you account for in your plan.

I understand why people like it and I think it is well designed, but for me, a little dull.

This game requires careful planning. You face one event per month. You have the advantage of knowing the order of the twelve challenges, but your ability to select resources is limited and the resources themselves are scarce.

I'm not sure how replayable In the Year of the Dragon is. There are multiple ways to score points but only one solution to each challenge.

A game for careful tacticians.

RATING: 8
I had a demo at Essen and this was my first real play and I won, but i think this is a neat package. There are different ways to build up your score, money is very tight, getting ahead on the person track early in the game helps a lot, but running a balanced game makes a big difference. Using your jokers well is crucial, the whole thing works very nicely and feels different from other Alea games, or most heavier games. The player who started badly scored massively right at the end and came second by 1 point, and the player who'd been challenging me the whole game imploded on the last turns and limped home 20 points adrift. I think the the evnt order is very significant, and in our game, the money and hammer actions came out in the same group on the first four turns, crucial in limiting the cash flow in the game. I negelcted the end scoring, but just kept my nose ahead. I put a big emphasis on keeping 1st place on the person track and so getting first action, and happily sacrificed farmers, builders, tax officials and doctors when they had served their purpose. I'm happy to play this again, there's definitley something here and I enjoyed the choices.

RATING: 10
WOW!  What a *brutal* and challenging game this is!  A lot of preparation is needed to overcome the disasters and casualities that come your way.  Careful planning is essential to having success.  I believe this game is an improvement over Notre Dame (a good game in its own right).  There is minimal luck with several disastrous elements and strategic paths.  In terms of the game's depth vs. playtime, this title offers the best bang for the buck that I have seen thus far.

Players manage money, actions, palaces, people/helpers, initiative, and future events all while trying their best to figure out the most efficient method of grabbing victory points.  I disagree with the comments stating this has little interaction.  I find it has quite a lot of it.  While there is no way to "attack" someone, the interaction involves monitoring relative position on various aspects with plenty of opportunities to royally screw your opponents!

Mistakes are unforgiving - but please don't let this deter you from giving this game the chance it deserves.  Stay with it and I think you may find some very interesting dynamics at play here.  It's such a treat to experience an aggressive game with clever mechanics and a "painfully" rough system.  No doubt this is a "gamer's game" - and it's a delightful one!  May be the best games to be released this year, and is climbing its way to reach my personal Top 10.  Grade: A+

It's a brain burner ladies and gentlemen. It's a game that's out to get you, and despite the smiling faces on the cover, this game doesn't like you very much at all. 

The theme can be basically be described as - "Life as a middling ruler in ancient China sucked, and you just got handed the job". 

Your little province is in bad shape, and unless you do some clever management and planning, things will get even worse. Famine, War, Disease, they're all there. Are you up to the task?

I don't know if I'm up to the job, and I can't decide if this game is a masterpiece or something that's best left for the masochists. I will play this again however, and see if it's really worth all the pain it puts you through.

Played 1 time with 3 players. I feel bad giving this game only a 6, but it is the straw that broke the camel's back for me: I am getting sick of heavy Euros. This game is unbelievably tense, well balanced, and cleverly designed. But it has almost no connection to theme and is, well, too perfectly balanced. I have played about 400 Euros and it's like I am suddenly disenchanted with the heavier, abstractive Euros like Goa, In The Year of The Dragon, and Puerto Rico. Princes of Florence was once a 10 for me; later a 9, now a 7. It's like I can feel the systems and that perfectly tuned math too much. So strange to arrive at this opinion after enjoying these games for so long. No my game tastes run to middleweight shorter Euros (Manila, Attika) or hybrids (Agricola). No fault of this came, it's just so...done for me. The heavier Euros need more flavor. The bar has been raised and the German publishers have no really answered the challenge (except for Lokout Games!)

RATING: 7.5
Delighted with this game.  There are two tracks: a victory point track and a player order track which is unique and a good game mechanic.  Players have to decide whether they advance on the victory point track or the player order track.  If players are always last on the player order track it is likely they will lose the game because they were unable to get what they needed to win the game.  Players acquire people essential to helping them stay alive through a series of disasters.  It is almost impossible to keep everyone alive and so players are hit with the often hard decision of whom dies.  Keeping your people alive will automatically hose other players, especially if you are first on the player order track.  I had a hard time taking this one out of the box because the contents looked a little boring--I am so glad I finally played.  Not a boring game at all--and I do like the pieces.  People playing this game are at a great disadvantage againist a player who has played it once.

I liked this game immediately.  While the events impose a script on the game by virtue of having to deal with them, it's interesting to see the different approaches the players take.  I have a feeling the game may have a problem though; the first players to grab the double privileges seem to always come out on top.  The 24 VP's for 6 yuan is the single best investment you came make in the game.  Will keep on playing to confirm if this is always the case.

Pretty interesting role-selection and worker-selection game where a lot of your time is spent butressing yourself against disasters.

Duration: The game takes about an hour and a half but it goes by fairly quickly. There isn't too much downtime.
Design: The variety comes from the order of the disasters, and you will play differently as a result.
Strategy: There are plenty of choices and risks to be taken, and a few different strategies that you can take.
Components: There were too few double privilege tiles. The board is spare, the illustrations decent. I was a bit annoyed at the randomness of the Chinese ideograms employed.
Theme: This is a Eurogame at its heart but the 12 months and disasters were pretty interesting.

Love this game! 

This is a game where you try to plan and prepare for the calamities ahead, fight for turn-order control (or adjust your strategy based on the actions of people who go before you), and try to remember to score VP while you're at it. The theme really draws you in. 

Agonizing decisions - everything is some sort of trade off, and you basically have to choose which losses you can handle, and which you can't. Lots of different ways to score/win, and lots of ways you could really get hurt. 

It plays out fairly quickly, with turns and phases going very fast. Because planning ahead is what this is all about, you have to be constantly engaged and the experience really satisfies.

After 22 games with AI (http://www.silvermask.co.uk/dragon2.swf)

This game is a bomb.

How Stefan Feld may have committed a game so tight, strategic, tactical, interactive, ruthless with players with so few components (a few tiles and character cards, money, 7 actions tiles, 12 events tiles) and rules so simple and pure ?

For me, only one response : this guy is a genius.

It would take full pear throughout the game, even if some events are less of a disadvantage than others:
- Day of the dragon if you have already established a good VP engine (court ladies, palaces, scholars, privileges)
- The Mongol invasion that can even turn to your advantage to discard a character become useless

The turn order's mechanism is a model of its kind, forcing players to choose between power and character position in turn order. The order of play is crucial in this game unless you have builded a good money engine. In fact, money is scarce and allows you to keep good latitude in your action selection.

Throughout the game, you are torn between:
- Ensuring the expansion of your palace (every turn a new character must be hosted, VPs at the end of the game) but not too much (you must feed them during the drought event (1 one rice by occupied palace))
- Ensuring a VP engine but it will prevent you from doing something else (make money, expand your palaces, producing rice, fighting for turn order...)
- Choosing the effective character to the detriment of turn order
- Deliberately suffer some events and sacrifice characters to the detriment of actions power and VPs at the end of the game

A game of planning, anticipation, adaptation to the choices of other players (eg prevent another player to win 11 VP per turn if he has 4 scholars in his palace), hand management, where you must find a balance.

Unclassifiable game whose appeal and addiction come, IMHO, from frustration and violence imposed to the players.

Simply awesome.

In the Year of the Dragon is a unique game about knowing the best timing to pick specific actions to minimize the effect of predominantly bad events that happen in most of the 12 turns.  I think it's a worthy addition to the Alea line of games.

The sensation of "not having all under the control"; that feeling as if "you don't have all the threads on your hands", that kind of emotions is what I love about this game. Stefan Feld (Roma, Notre Dame, Trajan, Luna, Castles of Burgundy, etc.) has created an totally anguishing game, another masterpiece of his own geniality.
You play during 12 months on China, in the year of the dragon. One event will happen at the end of each month. Shall you have what is needed to resist those hard events and rise yourself victorious?

This one is improving with more plays and is going over really well with my gaming group.

Many decisions to make, yet none of the five players ever seemed to be caught up in A/P.  Didn't find the theme created any kind of negative feeling during gameplay as some have mentioned.  Very solid and enjoyable first impression.

Update:  Double Privilege is a bit of a downer - not that it is an unbeatable strategy, but taking it in the first turn or two all but guarantees you a respectable score, a probable finish in the top two, and a good chance to win.  

Further Update:  Have played a few more times and I have pretty much lost my concern about the double privilege.  There is plenty of room for good play and winning play with our without the use of the double privilege.  What I'm concerned about is that my scores are getting worse instead of better.  One small mistake can really punish you!

Tedious "speadsheet" game of min/maxing your turns.  Yawn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The year of the dragon is a rather desolate year. "A long string of disasters" would be a more appropriate description.

Fortunately, the disasters that will strike are all known well in advance so it is possible to prepare for them. In theory. Unfortunately, there is never enough time, nor money, nor people to hire to avert everything that comes flying at you. The result is not pretty. Your palaces will crumble. Someone will get hurt. And die.

And all of that is a lot of fun. There are various approaches to disaster avoidance/recovery, and very different ways to score points, yet they are well-balanced and can lead to very close results. In addition to the race for VP there is the equally important jockeying for position throughout the game since the early birds can get actions for free while the late-comers have to pay for them. Hiring weaker workers is usually advantageous here, but obviously they don't perform that great. Overall, lots of stuff to think about, and lots of ways to go about it.

Just don't get emotionally attached to the people you hire.

Ein Jahr der Mühsal. Der Meister des Mangels. Mit keinem Spiel von Stefan Feld vor oder danach hat Stefan Feld sich selbst derart auf den Punkt gebracht. Im Gesamtkunstwerk des eurostilbestimmenden Autors bleibt das Frühwerk JAHR DES DRACHEN die komprimierte Meditation seiner eigenen typischen Spieleigenschaften, in denen es meist in mehr oder weniger vorder- bis hintergründiger Form um die Bewältigung von Schwierigkeiten geht, die sich wie ein Stachel ins Fleisch des Spielerlebnisses bohren. Dies ist womöglich der größte Beurteilungs-Irrtum, dem die Spiele von Feld unterliegen, denn gerade dieser Stachel ist das Zen(trum) der Feldschen Kreationen: viele empfinden den Mangelschmerz in seinen Spiele als nervig, hinderlich, dämpfend und messen die Spiele lieber am "Siegpunktsalat", den Feld oberflächlich oft auftischt. Dabei ist es gerade der offene oder verdeckte Stachel, der das grundsätzliche Spielerlebnis bei Feld ausmacht, weil der Mangel eine Wirklichkeit widerspiegelt, der sich die meisten Menschen ja doch ausgesetzt sehen: Probleme im Leben. JAHR DES DRACHEN kon(zen)triert sich in seinem dazu passenden minimalistischem, reduzierten Auftreten exakt auf diese Mißstandsrealität und kommt dabei ungeschminkt daher wie ein östliches Zen-Kloster. Wem es gelingt, sich am wenigsten zu beklagen und mit Lebensschmerzen wie Krankheit, Hunger, Überfall und Ausbeutung am besten zurechtzukommen, der darf sich als Sieger fühlen. Das kann auch der Letztplatzierte einer Partie sein. JAHR DES DRACHEN war jahrelang nur überteuert zu bekommen, die Jubiläumsausgabe verschafft jedem wieder einen günstigen Zugang zur Übung in Demut und Bescheidenheit. Geduld und das Warten auf bessere Zeiten wurde vom Leben schon immer belohnt.

RATING: 7
The game is really good designed, full of interesting decisions and different strategies. But the gamefeeling can become a bit negative as it is a very brutal game. You always encounter catastrophes which can destroy what you built up. Although you know from start on what catastrophes will arise at what moment it is nearly impossible do protect you against all of them. So it is inevitable that some of those catastrophes hit you.
I prefer games where - even if I not win - I can see afterwards that I have improved during the game. In this game it can happen that you win and your board seems to be as poor as at the start of the game.

It is very well thought and plays fast and easy. I like it more than N Dame.

Wow! What a great Feld game! I'm a little late to the party trying out YotD, but of course I'm glad to have finally gotten this one out onto the table. The multiple events and scoring opportunities reads a bit complicated, but it actually plays very well. I really enjoy how all the different parts come together. It's one of those games that has a lot of little things going on but it comes together so seemlessly that there is no need to look up the rules again once the game is underway. Having to decide whether to benefit in one area while being hampered in another is nothing new, but Feld makes it feel fresh. It comes off feeling a bit repetitive by the end and benefits from players taking their turns quickly. There is development in the game but not enough to make all 12 rounds feel highly engaging at all times.

Good grief, what a top game.  The ten events whose order changes from play to play mean it'll be hard to get tired of this, and actions are hard enough to come by that it feels a lot like Agricola--you know that there are several things that you ought to be doing, but there just isn't enough time.  You'll have to let something slide, and hope that the other players have an even tougher time of it.  Do not play this game if you feel the need to be a moral gamer, though.  To win, you have to ruthlessly calculate exactly how long a person deserves space in your court before you jettison them.  Imagine hiring a healer to help you hold onto several of your people, then allowing the next contagion to rid you of--that very healer.  Ah well, you needed room for the warrior who you'll sacrifice next turn, right after he helps you against the Mongol horde.  This game is just too, too much fun.  And gorgeous, too.

A real planners game as there are many tensions, overseen by a track of "disasters" which can be avoided through proper action.  Of course, everyone's in the same boat, so you need to balance your mitigation plans with other mechanisms like VP and characters acquisition (characters give you bonuses) as well as a nice turn order mechanism which allows fighting for position in the role selection.  The scrolls are overpowered IMHO.
With a couple more plays, the scrolls are definitely overpowered, and had to lower my rating.

Managing resources you "need" is not as fun as collecting points from the ways you want.  There is a palpable amount of tension though and that is exciting.  Is streamlined and designed well like Speicherstadt, etc.  Fun factor not as high, for me, as games like Bora Bora, Bruges, and CoB.

At first glance it looks extremely complicated. There are so many variables to consider and have in mind that it's almost imposible to do. And yes - the game IS complicated. But no - it's NOT so difficult to grasp. After the first game you will have the idea what's going on. And then - surprise!

As the order of the events changes randomly from game to game there isn't just one winning strategy. There are some basic interdependencies valid every play but in the end all that matters is your timing and outsmarting of your opponents. A very good game - the rating may go only higher.

It's the year of the dragon and it's a bad year for plagues, barbarian invasions, loan collections and famine.  It is a good year for the game's players who get to try to negate the effect of the year's bad events by recruiting useful personages into their castles.  A fine balance between keeping your position on the turn order track which is so necessary to give you the first selection of the action options as well as picking the people who will keep you safe through the disaster events.

This is one of the top games of the year along with Brass and Agricola. It is an easy game to explain that players could be playing in 15 minutes after some basic concepts, and then it runs fast, at good pace, and with no more than 90 minutes of playing time with five players. This is a tough game, in order to survive the calamities of the year of the dragon you will need a lot of atention an good judgement. Not a game for newcomers since more than play it you struggle against it and if you make a mistake you will be punished.

March 2008 - Great medium/light game that doesn't take too long to play.  There is a real tension between getting what you want and learning to survive with what's left.

I liked Notre Dame, even when it's one of those game I do poorly at, it's quick, fillerish game with a decent flow, very similar to Yspahan. ITYOTD is very similar, except it's much heavier game and is lacking the part where you have to memorise the different cards to do well. Like it a lot, but it has a flaw which really bugs me, a very powerful strategy, which requires experiene players to beat. We don't play any one game enough to get that experienced, and thus, the problem is very real.

It's hard not to see a lot of Notre Dame here.  Notre Dame was mediocre at best for me, a dull optimization game that played much the same every time.  But In the Year of the Dragon is much more sophisticated, more demanding, more interactive, tighter, and plays differently almost every time thanks to the variable setup.  A friend who has watched me win several times said "I keep watching to see what you do to win, but it's completely different every time."  I think that says a lot for the game.  There are many well-balanced ways to win, and you have to adjust your strategy based on the order of the events and based on what the other players are doing.  I like the   way the game presents you with too many challenges, forcing you to pick your poisons.  I like the Chinese court setting, which is evoked well.  I like that the game plays quickly.  I like that it's very easy to explain to new players.  Good game.

Two plays, once with three and once with four. A little dry, but definitely interesting. It has the typical Alea quality of being very interesting and replayable; it's also one of those Alea games like Princes of the Florence which reward a lot of look-ahead and calculation. Overall I think it's a very good design, but games which keep the players feeling like they're struggling and behind the 8-ball don't appeal to me much.

Played 5+ Feels well developed to me. Perfectly balanced options. An exhausting game to play due to the intensity of the decisions. *Update* now played 4 games and I am loving it, seems to play equally well with 3,4 or 5 *UPDATE* played a bunch of games on babiweb and the game holds up well to competitive play except it would have been nice if a clever alternative opening had become apparent rather than the tried and tested taking of a double privilege. A sensational 2 player game if players are equally experienced. April  09

RATING: 7
An enjoyable game, if you don't mind constant harrassment from various catastrophes throughout the "year."  There are lots of very interesting decisions to make, most especially in selecting the older (more effective at what they do) or younger (less effective, but are more likely to help you be the first to take your turn the next round) helpers.  There are many elements to help you to victory in this game, and it's up to you what you want to focus on: turn order (who goes first is very important), big money, earning VP during the game at the expense of the current month's event, building several palaces to hold lots of helpers, or focusing on end game scoring.  

After the twelve event tiles are laid out, the game is fairly deterministic much like Agricola, although here you are selecting actions instead of placing workers.  The player interaction is much like Agricola as well ("You completely just took my space")

RATING: 6
If Notre Dame is positive, In the Year is negative.  Everything is done not to gain, but to avoid loss.  Tense and exciting, but not that pleasant.

RATING: 9
I'd need to play more to understand. I like how it secretly has the same dynamic as the central mancala in Trajan; you have to do everything at some point (hire each person) and the weight of those decisions is split between the question of what order you do them in, and what you use your very limited "do anything you want" cards/actions on.

This game could be quite brutal. There are some softer arrangements of the disaster tiles that can make a good race game and there are other arrangements that force a damage management approach. Good variable play between games. I love how the turn order is set out by the make up of the people in your palaces.

I really like this game; it's a little more cutthroat and thematically feels more oppressive than Notre Dame, but it is very open to multiple strategies, scales well, plays fast and is (most importantly) very fun!

RATING: 6
Mechanics are interesting.  But, the rules are a bit confusing at first (or heck, even toward the end of the first game), and the game is intolerant of any mistakes -- each one you make can set you back quite a bit.  I want to like the game, but that last issue in particular hurts it for me, even though I have won every time I've played.

Fairly simple to play but it seemed like there was quite a bit of depth from my first play. Trying to stay ahead in turn order seemed important so that you don't miss out on certain actions or people. Likewise it seemed important to know when to take the time to prevent losing people and when to just go ahead and lose them, and also timing when to take point scoring people and actions. Cool game.

W Roku Smoka jest moją pierwszą grą Felda i pierwszą grą z tak precyzyjnie zazębiającymi się mechanizmami. Wszystko w tej grze współdziała idealnie. Gra jest bardzo intuicyjna i już po 2, 3 turach każdy łapie o co chodzi. Co ciekawe gra równie dobrze działa we 2 jak i w 5 osób. Po tej grze jestem w stanie złożyć oświadczenie, że zagram w każdą inną grę Felda nie zależnie od tego jaka będzie.

This game seems to share some character with Agricola in that there's so much to do and not enough time to do it all!  First play was with only 2 players, though I don't think adding more would add much to the experience except maybe some more positional vying.
Big advantage over Agricola: time.  Our first play only took an hour or so.

It moves fast and the mechanics work quite well. The luck factor is low, but you may be unintentionally harmed by choices of other players. There seems to be a number of viable strategies - as long as you buy a couple of privileges, which you can't lose and give points every turn. Indeed, buying the two-dragon privilege on the first few turns is quite overpowered. A bit boring with two players, and not particularly fun with more, but still an enjoyable and tense game of dealing with harmful events.

We haven't played this enough to get past the stage where it seems like the broken tokens (dragon scrolls) are a must-buy. My strategy is always to get a broken token as early as is convenient, then try to stay ahead on the military track by choosing junior advisors. It generally performs strongly. But because we haven't really found the counter to this approach, our games don't have much variety.

RATING: 7
I was really impressed by this game.  The interaction is nearly nonexistent, and it is multiplayer solitaire, BUT with multiple possible strategies to win, and with the variable turn mechanism adds replayability to a game that otherwise would have none.  The components look good except the butt-ugly and boring board.  There are a bunch of different actions, people, and events in the game that keep things interesting.  The fact that there is really no interaction takes a lot of the shine off.  I don't think that the game would stand up to repeated plays, even with the variable events to keep things spicy.  The only way any of the players can effect the others is through taking an action before them so they have to pay to take it.  I think the game will be "solved" soon, with the single best strategy coming to light, and no one will ever play this again.  There just isn't enough interaction here to warrant repeated plays.  HOWEVER, taking into consideration the lack of interaction, I really like the game for what it is.  If you are the type who wants a short multiplayer solitaire game where you build your little empire and sort of watch as others try to do the same, I'm not sure you could do any better than this game.  Certainly not in 45 minutes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just the right complexity level for my taste. Not very rules heavy, and the game is different each time because of different order of "happenings" through out the year and grouping of action tiles. I really want to try this more. I like the theme also.

I finally own this game and I like it very much. The design is very elegant and things fit together and make sense. The game feels balanced and rewards careful planning.

This is my girlfriend's favourite board game.

RATING: 8
Even after the first play, I definitely liked it.  With 4 players, the game is competitive, but not too tight, so it's a good intro for newbies.  With 5 players, I hear the game is tight on resources.

I like the balance of needing medicine, rice, gold, and helmets to avoid losing guys.  I like the tradeoffs of choosing high initiative vs. getting more powerful workers (e.g. young monk gives you 6 initiative, but double rice and double medicine give you only 1 or 2 initiative but are very effective at helping you from losing workers).  In the first game I played, I was last on the initiative track by a large margin, and never produced gold (except for getting the charity 3 several times for being poor), but still came in a strong second, only 5 points back, because I had 5 houses, kept 8 guys alive, and got 12 points from monks.  The key, like in games like Puerto Rico or Caylus, is to choose a different path than other players, so that you will have less conflict and get actions for free and workers before they run out.  This will definitely be hard in a 5-player game, which I'm looking forward to playing.

I've played it many times as a 2-player game -- it can be done within 40 minutes pretty easily, and 30 minutes if you rush.  It's a fun, balanced game for 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Extremely tight game where every decision counts as players try to advance in VP's while preparing for various coming disasters. Gameplay is deep but the rules not that complex, and offers good re-playability because of the random order of approaching catastrophes and the availability of Actions. I consider In The Year of The Dragon a gem. 

It also happens to be one of the most unforgiving games I've ever played. One wrong move, and several rounds are necessary to even partly recover. Certainly not a gateway game.

I love Feld games, I usually understand how people taste vary, but I don't undertand the BGG rating of this particular game against its feldian brothers.  Sure Castles of Burgundy is a solid game, but the other Felds, while good games, just can't compete with In the Year of the Dragon.

[Initial Impression: 4]
This game is almost entirely about forward planning - almost too much so. By the last 4 to 6 turns, the course of the game is likely to be decided and the remaining choices will be fairly obvious. It is important to look at the layout of the event tiles, plan a course for the game, and carry out that plan. Even a minor error (which can be an error of failing to select the point-optimizing option for yourself or one of failing to select an action that another player desperately needs and would not be able to pay for) can put a player well out of the running, especially if other players effectively capitalize on such errors. Turn order is incredibly important, especially early on, and giving up a point or two in favor of a better turn position can provide large returns. The game is very front-end loaded in that the build and privilege actions and the Court Lady all become worth less and less over time, but you do need to know when the proper time to take the Court Lady will be, as this selection will almost certainly put you behind in turn order. 

I believe the constraints on choices, the predetermined course of the game, and the straight-forward trade-offs among point payouts make this game "solvable" in the sense that it can be played in an algorithmic fashion (if X, then do Y, else Z, etc. - such an algorithm would have to adapt to the layout of event tiles and, to some extent, to the actions of other players). This makes for a mostly boring game that feels highly deterministic. The constant shuttling between players, while reducing downtime in face to face plays, makes the game drag during turn-based online play. The feeling of tension that many seem to enjoy feels artificially induced to me, and vanishes once you realize that your people are expendable under the right circumstances and that it is better to give them up if doing so will let you take an action that will net you more points over the course of the game. I make these comments from the perspective of someone who won our 5-player game by a substantial margin, but nonetheless felt the last third of the game essentially played itself out. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An intricate game and it's very Stefan Feld-esq. I like the fact that it is surprisingly deep but not very meaty rule-wise. The person track and the person tiles work perfectly together. As a chess player I don't see the gameplay to be dry - the theme is interesting enough and the situations you face each round are all very different which makes the mental exercise very challenging.

I don't like how important turn order is in this game.  If you are last most of the time then you will get screwed unless you have tons of money.  Getting points over time seems to be the way to go.  Get a 2-dragon tile during the first turn if possible.

RATING: 7
This game has so much going on that it's hard to know where to begin- players need to excel in military- and food; they need medicine, and money; they need to collect some direct VP's, and perhaps some fireworks too.

Stefan Feld has certainly created a roller-coaster of a year in a Chinese satrap, and as he has progressed he has gotten more clever in how the themes interweave with his always clever game mechanics. (Oh yes, and his penalties are also "more thematic".)

To me this one comes across as just a little too frenetic midgame (where one is either cresting the tide, or falling deep enough under the wave that they're not coming back up again), and then perhaps a little too predictable at the end, where only one or two calamities are left, and defenses against the completed problems fall by the wayside, for mass point accumulation to the best of one's abilities.

I've played this a couple times, and while I'd call it a good game, I disagree with those thinking it Feld's best (could be Trajan, or Burgundy, or...).  

I've given this a 7 to start with, and until it impresses me as better than that it's staying there.  A nice effort, but not my favorite Feld.

A "legszemettebb" "legszívatósabb" Feld játék. A játékosok 9 segítő közül választhatnak. Az építőmesterrel palotát építhetünk, ahol segítőink laknak, az adószedővel pénzhez juthatunk, a tudóssal ponthoz, a katona harcban segít, a gyógyító a fertőzés ellen véd, a szerzetes a játék végén ad pontot, a hölgy a játék közben,a tűzijátékos a tűzijáték rendezésben segít (szintén pontokat hoz), a földműves az etetésben segít. 

A segítőkhöz kapcsolódó 7 akció közül választhatunk, amelyek véletlenszerűen vannak felosztva annyi felé, ahány játékos játszik. A segítők sorszáma alapján választunk akciót. Aki hátrébb áll nagyon lemarad, mert választhatja ugyanazt az akció csoportot is, amelyet a korábbi játékos, de ezért 3 yüant kell fizetni, márpedig ez rengeteg pénz ebben a játékban. Tehát aki lemarad a segítők sorszámában, az jó eséllyel kikap. 

Ráadásul minden segítségre szükségünk van, mert minden hónapban jön egy negatív esemény (császári pénzbeszedő, aszály, mongol támadás stb). Amelyiknél szinte mindig veszítünk segítőket (5-ből 4 esetben). 

Az embernek az az érzése, hogy az győz akinek sikerül úgy játszania, hogy minél kevesebbet veszítsen. A játék során végig ez az érzés munkálkodik az emberben.  Ezzel a játékkal biztos nem fogja megszeretni senki sem a Feld játékokat,sem a társasjátékokat. Gondolkodós játék, de csak a frusztrációt jól tűrők részére.

It's remarkable how an interesting game can be created with very little randomness and no hidden information. More thematic than Notre Dame in that you're collecting cash, rice, and medicine (fireworks seems to jar very slightly with the others) to avoid calamity rather than just cubes. Slightly worrying that I ran away with my first game, getting 10vp/turn from 3 'book' tiles, so there's the possibility of some systemic imbalance. The 5 player game is tougher, don't run out of money or you're screwed. With a full game collection this is below the purchase threshold for me, but a solid game nonetheless.

Un juego de gestión de riesgos, limitación de daños y de previsión de los siguientes turnos.

Además escala muy bien de 2 a 5 jugadores. A algunos les recuerda a Notre Dame (yo considero que tienen sensaciones distintas). La aleatoriedad de los eventos asegura elevada rejugabilidad. Me gusta mucho que nadie pueda empezar el juego con los mismos trabajadores, el equilibrio cuando decides o bien ir por delante y poder usar la acción que necesitas o bien ir más lento pero ser capaz de hacer más con esa acción y que se compita contra el juego además de contra el resto de jugadores. Pegas: los errores se pagan muy caros. Estrategia del doble privilegio (muy dificil competir contra ella si eres novato). Problemas de escapadas en solitario.

I like that this game is punishing.  You do your best to plan and manage the disasters.  You can't handle everything, however, so often time you have to strategically decide when you take a hit.  I like that, but I understand that some players will not.  Good replayability as the sequence of disasters changes each game.

RATING: 7.5
Comparing to other Stefan games, this along with [thing=25554][/thing] & [thing=84876][/thing] integrates the mechanics well then the rest.

A little bit too long and too calculative. Also suffering other flaws that games with 100% open information have, which is fine for me. Amazingly, the game system feels unique even now(2015).

2015.11.10 Played some games on BGA recently. The numerical balance of workers(i.e. people tiles) is better than I've thought. However, players can be divided into those who constantly going first in action selection and those who do not. Keep going first suffers too little pain from the events. Note that It's not clear for me if it's imbalanced, but it feels very different when you are behind in turn order and against the wind. Also, I suspect buying big privilege at 1st round is too dominating.

With this game you have about a dozen things to think about every move! I love it! :) 
The more we play this game the more i like it. We played it with 2, wich is, i think, a bit easier cus you have only you and your partner to worrie about. But its still no picknick!

With 4 the game was also great!

This game is not easy to play. If you not in the mood to do a lot of brain work. than just leave it in the closet for the night. :) But i think this is a great game!

Dec17:

Almost a decade later I came back to this in it's "10th anniversary form".  I actually bought the 10th anniversary of this and Notre Dame (this mostly as an add-on).

And ya know, I appreciate this game a lot more now.  Perhaps I just am better ignoring the "passive" and focusing just on the "aggressive" portion of this game.

I've also grown to appreciate the cohesiveness of the game.  The interaction between people, actions and events is just awesome.

And the non-cyclic turn order is annoying, but I've also grown to appreciate the benefits more (and just gotten more aggressive about yelling at people to take their turn).

Still, it can totally knock a player out of the game, which isn't cool.



Original comment (circa 2008):

Sadly, not a great follow up to Notre Dame IMHO.  I still enjoy the multiple paths to victory and the reasonably easy to grasp game play.  Unfortunately, a lot of negatives were introduced:

1. The rats are back, but this time they can knock someone right out of the game.  One played missed buying an action by $1, and proceeded to lose 5 people over 2 turns.  They were finished, but still had 45 minutes of game left.

2. I hate player turn reordering.  It adds tons of time as each player has to of course ask "Who's turn is it?"

3. I've come to really despise "worker placement"/"action selection".  It's the most passive aggressive form of player interaction I've encountered.

The events are what enticed me about this game. I really like the idea of having to prepare yourself for impending calamities. The game works quite well and is actually very simple to play. I think that experienced players can play this in 30 - 40 minutes which is an added bonus.

In the Year of the Dragon is a similar style of game to Stefan Feld's previous effort for Alea: Notre Dame. Both games feature a set of mechanics that are melded together successfully into a game that is relatively easy to learn and quick to play, with the outcome depending on the cumulative result of numerous tactical decisions. I prefer In the Year of the Dragon both because of the theme, which is a little more integrated into the game, and the higher level of tension. The only slight problem, it seems to me, is that early purchase of a Double Privilege is disproportionately powerful. If all players are aware of this the problem is minor, but if there are newbies in a game they are likely to be at a significant disadvantage.

can't comment too much as i've only played once - a lot going on to figure out a strategy on your first game - definitely a game that needs a few plays before you actually 'get it' - although, this is tough as i don't normally have enough over for game night to play this enough

First play - This game is ok.  Seems like lots of stuff goingg on, but really, there is very little.  Get an efficient VP engine going that can survive the bad things and you do well.  Not sure what the rage on this one is...needs more plays.

I could see this climbing.  The variability of the game is a real attraction.  I am not sure that the full complement of 5 players is the right way to go.  3 felt pretty good, but I am guessing that 4 would be the sweet spot of downtime vs. tension.

There are two people in the mountains, and they run into the Mongol horde. The first person starts to bow; the second person starts lacing up his boots.

There's quite a bit to like about ITYOTD. Scales well from 2-5, randomized setup (which is an element I'm a fan of), relatively simple rules, and a crushing struggle. But it's kind of a blunt object...the problems the game presents are too straightforward for me to proclaim this game as "great". And it's fairly component-heavy...like it's trying to be a deep, intricate game but unfortunately finds itself fighting out of its weight class.

In addition, where there's smoke there's probably fire: buying the big privilege on round 1 seems to be too dominant.

  In short, it's a management of resources in China in order to deal with impending disasters during the Year of the Dragon..

The theme is quite strong.

See my review after 20 plays for full commentary: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/274044/agri-what-best-gamers-game-come-out-awhile

Solid follow-up to Notre Dame (this is better actually) and an excellent addition to the Alea line up (read a Gamer's game). Things are very tight, tense and unforgiving again here and the bad shit is coming your way so start planning where to take the hit!  

While it has a nice theme it is only loosely  tied to the mechanics but I still enjoyed the theme being there at any rate. So many things you need to do here and not enough actions to do them, yep, great turn angst here on several levels. One of the main things you are doing is trying to minimize almost certain loss while building an efficient VP engine at the same time. You are also trying to recruit some good workers HOWEVER while the better worker provides more it also has a bigger price which is paid by moving less on the turn order track, angst again and nice balance as well. Turn order is huge in the game as actions are free for the first taker, sloppy seconds or more will cost you 3 Yuan so you really don't want to go this route but alas you just might have to at times. This is where someone can make a bit of a breakaway however we have found that it is a LOSER breaking away (usually from a critical error) not a winner as the system is pretty unforgiving so runaway LEADER is NOT accurate, there is a difference.

Comparing Notre Dame, and they should be compared as they do scratch the same itch (building a VP machine while minimizing loss, card driven, etc), I much prefer having all my cards in hand from the beginning and being able to plan when to play them throughout the game versus the card drafting of ND. The other big difference from ND is that the events are preset for each round right from the beginning so again planning is rewarded much more versus never knowing what abilities or bad stuff might be coming (ie mice) let along cards. While in ND you need to watch the mice here there are four different bad events that happen twice each, this means 8 of 12 rounds are bad but some a lot more so than others and you do know when they are coming so at least you have a chance to prepare for them. This also might be a little more interactive although it is close but here there is a very nice battle for turn order that really adds to the turn angst when hiring characters every turn, if your able to 'jump' on top of someone on the initiative track you get to go before them which can be quite important and affect your choices. Watching the other players might also be a little more important here as to how to possibly adapt your strategy 'around' theirs and if you are watching close enough screwage is possible. Now don't get me wrong, I quite like ND however if someone suggests both I would pick this almost every time as they are both similiar (they feel different but the core game is the same) only here there is less luck and more planning which I prefer.

Very little luck overall actually, lots of planning, and so far looks like multiple ways to win although a couple do look to be superior but it still seems quite balanced. Playable in about 60 minutes with 3 or roughly 15 to 20 minutes per player which is nice and quick and probably best with 3 or 4 players. More Euro goodness in Alea clothing.

[u]UPDATE:[/u]8 => 8.5 - 5 plays in and the game is becoming a very nice challenge as you fight to beat the game AND your opponents (like ND again here) and it scales very well 3 to 5. Still a little leary on the multiple strategies but I think at least 3 dominant ones will emerge and one thing is certain, being able to adapt your strategy on the fly can be a critical skill in this as is watching what others are doing and trying to work around them. This game has scored big points in our group for 'post game discussions' and actually had me calculating out strategies to the point I wrote them down which I have never done before. I have a strategy article pending which I will post soon. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 9 Fantastic TENSE, TIGHT and BRUTAL game, 7 plays in and it really feels like you are in a vice being squeezed throughout the game and something is going to pop...and pop you will! Crisis management in spades here; planning where, when and how bad to take the hits is key. This is the core game and it certainly won't appeal to everyone but our group of 'Gamer's' love it and love the challenge it presents each game!

Replay is there thanks to the order of events being different game to game, the order of how the actions are grouped and even having to adapt to what others are doing which all also ensure that just one strategy will not work. POF & TAJ fans will dig the game-long planning, multiple paths and tension among other things. 

Multiple paths have been confirmed along with scaling well 3 to 5 however I think I am now leaning towards the very tight 5 player game is best theory. The game is strangely addicting and FUN as you are always trying to beat the game and the other players AND maybe even yourself, that is trying to beat your prior score and trying to out-manage what you did last time. If I'm 20 games in and I still dig it this much it could hit a 10 for me, more games to confirm. 

Thank you Stefan, can't wait to see what you have in store after Roma II ...

RATING: 8.1
In the Year of the Dragon is a very tight game that requires careful planning and efficient play to minimize your losses, which will inevitably occur from at least one (and likely more) of the events plaguing 1000 A.D. China, i.e., drought, contagion, Mongol invasion, and bankrupting taxation.  Aside from shuffling and separating the action cards into groups for priority selection each round, there is no luck here, making this a very tense game where I find myself spending a lengthy amount of time evaluating my options.  There is a lot of fun and deep strategy here.  In a way, it reminds me of Bruges (same designer) stripped of its randomness and victory point free-for-all and injected with agonizing decisions and foreboding events that conjure up an intense struggle.  I've really been enjoying the game experience thus far.

The components and game art, however, are not very inspired (for my taste, at least).  While the aesthetics don't take away from the gameplay, this game really deserves some higher production values.

For a little while, I thought Stefan Feld was my favorite designer, but then I played some of his lighter games and I'm not sure anymore. This fits in well with the rest of those games I've played in that it's just a little too straightforward. There's no real twist to make it interesting. Everything sort of just does the one thing it says that it does and at any given point it's not too hard to see what the best thing is.

I got destroyed in my first game though it was easy to see many of my mistake half-way through that game. That being said, I've learned it's impossible to recover from early bad decisions. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not, we'll see after some more plays.

*Update*  Played this a few times and I like it alot! Bumping my rating up to an 8.5.  I might have given it a nine but I'm not sure if this game will wear out it's welcome.  There are a few different strategies that I'm seeing but it's all a bit repetitious.

*Update* I've played this 14 times now and I enjoy the game. However I don't think it has any real stamina as far as repeated future plays. In fact, if it weren't on MabiWeb I would have played this a whole lot less. Though I own a copy of the game, I imagine it will mostly only be played on MabiWeb simply because it's there! Anyhow, I dropped my rating from an 8.5 to a 7.5

I'm going down to a 9. I wish it was easier to counter the double scroll strategy.  I've never played a game that always makes me want to turn around and play it again immediately after I finish a game.  This one does.   it also scales very well from 3-5.

Positives: Perfect game length to strategy ratio. The game generally moves right along and involves everyone every turn and phase. Decent variety within a given game. Tense decisions. Gorgeous tile artwork. Fun to try to survive and maybe even thrive.

Negatives: Rich get richer. Occasional AP turns, but feels worse than it actually is when it happens because of the usually quick actions. Feels a little hollow, overall. Dislike the double-dragon first turn move.

Overall: Solid game that I enjoy playing, but doesn't make me think about it afterwards. +.01 for me being born in the year of the dragon.

Didn't enjoy my one and only playing.  I do like the idea of a game that's unforgiving of the players.  However, I found myself in a "death spiral" midway through the game, and there was absolutely no way out.  I could see it coming, and there was nothing I could do to salvage the game.  I don't mind losing, but I do mind having to play a game for another 45 minutes knowing there is no way out.  Probably won't play this again.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2011)

This is a hard game for me, so far I have been unable to win it. Still I like it a lot, however many times I have had more stress than fun playing it (not that much of either), so for now I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.5. This is a game I would like to play from time to time, but not that often. Also I want to buy it.

The game rules are very easy to learn and teach, however the game has lots of hard decisions coupled with some luck (in the way each action is grouped each turn). I really like that the whole year is visible so you can plan your moves way ahead. I should like more the game, but for some reason I don’t want to play it very often.

This is definitively a tense, good game, the play time is relatively short making this easy to bring to the table. Nowadays I´m enjoying it more than before, so I’m upgrading its rating. I like most games from Feld (except Macao but I will give it another chance to woe me).

With even more plays, my appreciation for In the Year of the Dragon has grown a lot, now it is a solid 7.0 for me. Nowadays I prefer to play hard and punishing games and ITYOTD fits the bill perfectly. I still want to buy it but I have been unable to do so (I already have the mini expansions :D).

As with many of my favorite games, it has a steep learning curve, a positive for me. This also means an experienced player will crush a new one but this didn’t bother me when I was the crushed one. 

The art and game board are of regular quality.

Bottom line, it is a good game I usually want to play, it packs hard decisions (who lives and who dies) and high tension in a relatively short play time.

Another clever Feld title...my knock against it is for the replay aspects.  I've played this dozens of times now online and have enjoyed doing so however I've felt my moves rather obvious.  I guess I mean to say experience removes the agonizing decisions from the game.  That said I'll hang onto it and only play it sporadically from here on to try and keep it fresh.

Putting this up for trade.  Neat game but I've just not been able to get it to the table.  My copy includes the Alea expansion.

This one plays a bit long, but the interactions are interesting enough that I don't mind.  I like the multiple paths to victory (playing for points now vs. banking on endgame scoring) and the balance you have to strike.  I also like how well the randomization of the event tiles forces a flexibility in approach - a winning strategy in one game becomes disastrous with a different sequence of events.

Oh my god!  There's almost too much going on in this game.  You know that bad things are going to happen... and when.  And it's this "disaster management" that makes the game interesting.

No player starts the game with the same people and the order of the events will control the 'flavour' of the game, so replayability is endless... as are the strategies.

It was a big hit at our last Games Day and I expect that it will get many more plays throughout the year.

It's taken over from Arkadia as my favourite game from 2007... an easy '9.'

Very different feel for a euro, in a very good way. Minimal random, and the board set up at the beginning allow for elaborate strategies/paths to get to the same goal of most vps. Very fun and tense.

After a few plays, I have seen many different strats prevail.  The disaster lay out can help an experienced player determine thier choice, but it still isn't a guarantee.  I enjoy the replayability and increased my rating from 7 to 8.

Great game.  This is your typical Euro - so many choices so little time to do them all.  You just have to set yourself up for the current months event and work your way through the year picking and choosing which disasters you want to avoid or accept.

RATING: 6
Not my cup of tea.  I like the pervading nihilism that you're going to get destroyed by taxation, famine, war, or disease. (That is, the winner is whomever gets destroyed least.) I like the way you have exactly twelve cards to play (the same twelve as everyone else), and you only get to play them once.  I like the way it's all open-info from the start: you know exactly which turns will have which disaster.
I don't like: So many complicated factors to weigh. I found myself unable to avoid AP.  I found the separate "turn order" track and pieces annoying and ad hoc. (Sure it gives you another way to win and another trade-off; but is it worth the trouble?)  In fact, I found all the multiple obtuse ways to score simply confusing. I'm surprised when reviewers say the design has no fat; for me it's inelegant and not a "clean" game.
Alternatives I'd rather play: If I want to go the multiple melds route, I'll play Ra, which simplifies the rest down so you can actually strategize. If I want the "balance complex parts, over a series of narrative rounds" I'll play Gates of Loyang, in which you similarly must plan for disaster, adjust the parts, and scrap helpers when they no longer serve you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Such a fun "long-game" game.  Love being able to plan out more or less the whole game's strategy from the first round.  Only downside is potential imbalance of turn-order track (hard to catch up & overtake the leader) however there are workarounds that make it more balanced than it initially appears.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a very interesting game, but it is very unforgiving, you pay for mistakes for several rounds if not the rest of the game. It's not my favorite Feld game, but I would be willing to play it when asked.

I cannot believe how good this game is. Every time I play, I like it more. I mean, if you like the whole Euro-multiple-paths-to-victory-points thing, but love screwage, you have to love this game. Screwage is built-in, by design. If n people are playing, you are pretty much guaranteed to be screwing one of those n (yes I can count) every move you make. It hurts in a very good way.

13.8.2008: This game is mean. I like it. It kicks you when you're down. That one bad turn will come back and haunt you sooner or later. I thought the player interaction would be low, but even though it is a bit low you can really mess with the other players from time to time. And that small trouble you cause might escalate. I debated whether to give it an 8 or a 9, but chose 9 because it's so mean.

RATING: 6
This game has you living on the edge almost every turn. Turn order is decidedly important and the game has a method for determining and altering turn order that is tremendously original. One thing you should know, though. The game is rather unforgiving of early mistakes. There really is no "catch up" mechanic. If the first couple of disasters hit you hard, you are pretty much done.

UPDATE: Looking back over these comments, I see I never went back to update it. In the end, subsequent games weren't as tense as the first. Unless you get unlucky up front (which is unsatisfying if that's what gets you), I found the disasters pretty easy to plan for. Knocked this down a point and traded it long ago.

Juego bastante desafiante, en el que tienes que tratar de adaptarte a los eventos que van viniendo, al mismo tiempo que debes hacer mejor puntuación que tus rivales.

Todos los jugadores tienen los mismos personajes, y cada jugador decide cuándo y cómo emplearlos, de manera que consiga una buena estrategia.

A very tight game, has a Princes of Florence type feel to it.  The two different tracks is a fairly unique element.  Not sure if the game is totally balanced, and it may be that paying 5 for an early 2 point per turn tablet is a killer strategy.  Also, if someone gets ahead on the "go first" turn track, they could become a runaway leader since they will get to place first for free.  Still enjoy the game, although not quite as much as when it first came out.

Very interesting game. A little more abstract than Castles of Burgundy, if that's possible. Definitely was not expecting the engine tear down mid-game due to bad planning for impending events. Really liked that mechanic. 

The rule book made the game feel more complex to set up than it actually was. Problably could have been worded better. Maybe poor translation. The text on the reference cards and the side text in the manual is ultra small and difficult to read! But once you get going though, the game is a breeze.

RATING: 5
I have a lot of respect for In the Year of the Dragon. It's a very well-made game about "weathering the storm" that never deviates from that core design principle. It's a game where players are beat to a pulp but whoever toughs it out with the most grit wins. That's about as far from my preferences as possible. 

But, I recognize the success of the design, so a 5 rating is appropriate. Also, for whatever reason, this gives me a Knizia vibe.

Very nice game by the designer of Notre Dame (Stefan Feld). Some have likened this game to ND since both games involve the players avoiding disasters of some kind. In the year of the dragon gives you almost perfect information from the beginning and has you basically decide your strategy from the word go, with elements of luck causing the players to make tactical diversions throughout the game.

There seem to be many paths to victory and the game is very well balanced. I've played with 3 and 4 players and have enjoyed trying new strategies.

Update: rating moved from 8 to 9
I love this game, it offers lots of interesting decisions and subtle player interaction... as well as some overt player interaction. The game demands that you choose a strategy, but one that other's are not also pursuing. It might be a temporary jump to 9... but after 6 games I feel pretty confident that it will stay at this rating. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Be careful playing this game because the flow can be kind of confusing.   Needs a phase track.  But, otherwise it is a great game.   The theme is depressing because basically all you are doing is averting diaster to avoid killing your people.   Mechanics include bidding and you can choose people, that protect your people from being hit by disaster, and this also effects turn order.   Lots of cool intertwined mechanics.

I like this better than Notre Dame, Feld's previous game. It has a good balance of long-term preparing for the disasters and tactical optimization of each move. The game system really can destroy you as I had to experience in my first game when I lost 2 of my 3 palaces and the majority of my people.
In the disaster management category this is the strategic gamers' option while Galaxy Trucker is the fun chaotic alternative and World Without End the game for players who like theme but think that GT is too chaotic.

Very favorable initial impression.  Alea's big box games seem very hit and miss after the last few, so I approached this game with caution.  The uninspiring theme (basically the same as any other euro game, just in China) and boring-looking board didn't help.  I was pleasantly surprised by the game.  A very streamlined ruleset offers a lot of challenge and depth, with a need for good planning.  There are definite similarities to Notre Dame, but for some reason I like this one a little more - the calamities are more urgent than the rat problem, but not as extreme as many make them out to be.  Looking forward to delving deeper into this one.

Good game, I quite liked this one. Although the rules are a bit overwhelming and are hard to explain, I think once people have a few plays it begins to flow nicely.

Pretty artwork, overwhelming number of options and screwage opportunities and great tension in deciding what to do on a given turn. Unfortunately, despite liking the game, I still think I would choose to play other Alea games like Notre Dame or Ra over this. Its maybe just a bit too abstract and not as fun as the other games.

After a total of four plays, I think this game is fantastic. Yes, it is quite brutal in the sense that you are going to have to lose some guys, but there are just so many tough decisions and seemingly many different ways to win.

When I was first being taught ItYotD, my friend mentioned that afterwards I wouldn't want to play Notre Dame again.  I chuckled at this because I was a fan of Notre Dame.  But afterwards, I found that to be true, Notre Dame seemed... kind of one dimensional... after experiencing Year of the Dragon.Unlike Notre Dame, almost everything is visible in ItYotD.  The only unknown is how the actions are going to be grouped.  So you are more in control of your destiny, unlike Notre Dame where you have to take what your opponents draw and give to you.  There also seems to be a wider variety of possible winning strategies than Notre Dame (though some claim that the first turn double dragon privilege is a dominant strategy).

Theme is almost non existent and the game looks really dull, but the gameplay is beautiful poetry of negativity. Try to build an engine while consistently looking for which parts are potentially dropping of your engine. You also want to be doing a lot more all the time than what you are allowed to do. Add to this the constant fighting for turn order done with a brilliant mechanism and you have a tough cookie to break. The game flows quickly and it is exciting. I would like to play more.

The Year of the Dragon seems to be a pretty tough year... And while it seems strange that the players can forsee events like droughts and sickness and attacks many months ahead, it makes for a great game, which is all about strategy. 

Since you do know right from the start for what you have to prepare in each single month, you can never really blame it on luck. If those events devestate you, it's your own fault since you didn't prepare yourself properly.

RATING: 7
Resource acquisition game where you want to have the right resources at the right times to get bonuses or avoid penalties, but so does everyone else. Player interaction is limited to action drafting and, by extension, keeping ahead in the battle for turn order, so likely to get stale if you don't like that kind of game.

Now played rather a lot against bots; it definitely works as a casual game. I can also see that there is a lot of player interaction through action hogging, much of which will amount to asymmetric and/or incidental screwage. Curious to see how this works out in a real game.

It's unfortunate that early-turn large privilege seems to be an automatic choice. The fact that people present precariously elaborate strategies to argue first-turn privilege can be beaten doesn't really convince you there isn't an issue.

I can't wait for the english version to come out - or at least for the game to come to Canada so I can pick it up! Increased to a 9.5 Update: played it twice again. Update: Fantastic! Got Our High Score of 119! Woohoo! A game that truly deserves a 10 in my book, I have never played a game this much and had this much want to play more! Update: New high score - 121* (3 player)Update: 121 in 5 player now as well!

Only 3 plays, so take with a grain of salt and adjust for "newness" factor, but I was blown away by the combination of simple, straightfoward gameplay vs. the horrifying decisions needed to made in the minimal amount of turns available.  Mitigate the damage...score when/if you can...a blast!
Fast, fun and ferocious!  Another winner from Alea and perhaps, the best since Louis, imho.

Only reason for it not being a full-fledged 10 is that it is a tad depressing in its concept.  :)  Not much good happens... ;)

RATING: 9
The Good: One of the signs of a good game is that you always want to do more on your turn than you are able, and this one does that better than almost any game I know of. Part of the reason for this is that, in addition to trying to score, there are bad events scheduled to take place throughout the game that you REALLY need to prepare for. That and several paths to victory make this one a winner. 

The Bad: Although we did not experience it, I could see the possibility for some analysis paralysis, due to the many choices each turn. I feel that the board is rather plain and that the palace tiles are too thin. Some may not like the very bad events that occur. However, they are mapped out for all to see thru-out the game, so all players can plan for them.

It reminded me of something else (anything else) that I'd much rather play than this game.  Not sure what to say - this just didn't do it for me.  The unattractive board and the theme, which just doesn't generate any interest in me, didn't help matters.

PROS: Multiple layers, different game every time, good player screwage, short play time, it has hookers, tax collectors can die
CONS: you won't "get it" until half way through the first go, i mean it's not too bad to explain, but you just don't immediatley realize how many strategies there are.  

The game seems to give you just enough actions to "maintain" your empire.  To "advance" your empire (get setup to start accruing more than the baseline 2VP per turn), you have to take a risk, which could end up biting you.  If you do it too early, you might be struggling to catch up the rest of the game, too late, and someone else already has the VP edge.  BUT...there isn't a single strategy that's going to work every time, because the events are randomized every GAME, though they are laid out for everyone to see, so from the start you have perfect knowledge of that aspect, and you can start formulating a strategy...but if you don't stay ahead on the player track, or pick up a person before someone else, you could get hosed.

I see high replay on this one.

Rigid, mechanical, themeless Euro, as Feld is wont to make. The crux of the game is finding some wiggle room between the gears of the machine, so to speak. Must take advantage of any seam where you can eke out a few points between trying to avoid the myriad punishments.

Only played this a couple of times and haven't gotten a feel yet for how to play well.  The game flows well and is quite quick to play, even with 12 rounds each with 3/4 actions per player.  It feels like a "survival" game in the sense that first you need to beat the game and then you need to beat your Opponent - perhaps the former will not be such an issue once I have a better handle on how to play well

I am not entirely sure where this stacks with my Felds, but it is near the top of the stack.  There is no luck in this game.  At higher player counts there is a ton of mitigation.

Much of this game is about preparing for upcoming "events" that typically result in the death of some of your people. Several strategies seem to work for victory - including one that results in a big bonus at games end for a “come-from-behind” win. If you don't mind the constant pressure of minimizing the damage, the game is very good.

Intuitive and simple without being simplistic.  Few choices, but each one has significance.  

Played with gamers and non-gamers - gamers gave it a Thumbs Up. The non-gamers dubbed the monk "the sorcerer", and had more fun regaling us with stories of his drunken debauchery and insatiable gluttony than playing.

Excellent luck-low, brutal and unforgiving strategy game. Careful planning is crucial when deciding how to handle the different calamities (you only have 12 actions). Look to what other players are doing, a suboptimal move can wreck their plans and create havoc in their palaces (e.g. when someone really needs rice or yuans for the next event). Endscores will be very tight between players with a similar level of experience (5-player game with 1 point between first, second and third place and another 5-player game with a tied first place). Multiple paths to victory, but don't forget the buddha's for the endscore and take in account that the books can be very powerful during the year. The random sequence of the disasters ensures replayability and a quite different game play. ***** 44 plays (3/4/5 player): 27 victories & 13 second places (two ties with first player, but lower on prestige) - 4 plays (2 player): 2 wins. ***** My most impressive victory (5-player game - 4/5/2008 Delle): at the final count of the year: 6 palaces with 11 people (I only lost two people!) and 12 points from buddha's resulting in a total of 125 points (second place was at 103, third at 85, fourth at 83 and fifth at 81) - a near perfect synchronisation with the flow of events during the year. ***** Yep, finally succeeded in keeping all 13 people alive until the end! But, the event sequence was favourable and I was the only experienced player on the table (5 player game). Did this a second time (4 player game), but didn't win the game (should have bought a privilige). ***** My preferred strategy: keeping as many people as possible in the palaces until the end. This generates points during the game (as each palace is a point - each round) and ensures a lot of points at the end of the game (each person is worth 2 victory points). Having the different personalities also provides flexibility in the actions from which you can choose. Combine this with an early privilige (1 or 2 dragons depending on the events) and buddha's. This strategy beats the multiple priviliges and the books strategy (in one of my games: the person ending up in second place had 6 privilige dragons - I had only 1, but kept 11 people in 8 palaces, including four buddha's in three storey palaces [just for fun: the event in the 11th month was drought/famine and I had rice for all 8 palaces!] - enough to win with 9 points difference). ***** Belgian Champion in 2008 (Multijeux) - the final game was one of the most engaging and tough games I played - tense until the end - a very close victory, thanks to an unexpected, but crucial choice of picking a second 3 value "helmet".

Like TTR this is a game which i won't play against a couple. The game is pretty much open information and because of that people should be able to block other people (those that are leading)  from actions. If they won't do that or they do it against one person (not looking at the lead)  the game won't work as well.

RATING: 8.5
I like the interplay of recruitment, initiative, events, and scoring.  I don't think I have a great grasp of the best strategies to use in each game, but it's nice to see how different approaches work.  Some people and actions seem underused, so I'd like to see whether people can successfully make use of all available options.

It's probably best with all five players, since the elder people are limited to four.  This keeps the tension high, not allowing one player to lag far behind in initiative without some consequence.

Another solid Alea title in which you have to make difficult decisions in which avenues to victory points you will pursue combined with the question of how can I avoid losing much in the process?  The disasters in this game can be very brutal if not properly prepared for in advance and its not really all that much fun to watch your doom coming!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's abstract, it's brutal and it lacks variety. It's less point salad and more brain salad surgery. When you've had to let your farmer go after he failed to deliver the rice you need to feed your people and then you have to go snivelling and grovelling to the Emperor with pathetic excuses for the pitiful tribute you offer him, you wonder whether you might as well just use the bloke with the sledgehammer to knock down what remains of your squallid and (now) empty little palace. But somehow you still come back for more. More Mongol invasions, more useless ladies with fans and more death, pestilence and destruction.

Very good Euro that manages to feel different than other games of its type.  It is possible to fall behind in some respects and realize that your position is hopeless but that problem is inherent in many games and it may seem less evident in future games after I have had more exposure to the flow of the game and the importance of managing the cards.

The rounds are pretty simple, but the permutations of how you deal with the catastophes and maximize victory point gains is very puzzly. However, with that graph I found in the forums, I wonder how much variance there is in the strategy you employ (at least in a 3+ player game). The choices seem to be fairly straightforward, but I haven't replayed it enough times to be sure.

RATING: 8
One of the few Stefan Feld games I like. It’s got the typical Euro mechanic that there are very few ways to screw with the other people, apart from going before them and taking an action in a group they want. (Predictably, the number of each person available for recruiting is also tied to the number of players.) Will you notice this lack of interaction? Probably not. If you’re in a room with three other guys and a tiger, and the tiger is mauling you, what the other guys are or aren’t doing is of little concern. What I’m saying here is that the game itself, the situation set up in front of you, is so tense and tough that it’s almost a relief that nobody can also set your palaces on fire or something.

I’ve played a few times, and each time I managed to survive the year without any major problems. For every event, I either had exactly what I needed to avoid the penalty, or could easily pay the price without harming myself too much. My crisis management skill was awesome. I also lost pathetically every time, because it’s not enough to do that, you also have to do something to, you know, win. You’re running a race on a treadmill, and staying the same place will require effort but it’s not going to get you to the finish line.

I really like this game - for me it's the best game I've played on this year's Essen Fair. No other game makes you feel that short of THAT many things, although many claim to. You HAVE to lose something - money or people - in the course of the game and you can only try to minimze your losses. Or you can concentrate on gaining points instead even though this could be punished in the end-game scoring. All in all it's a very clever game with many strategic paths to victory - highly recommended!

RATING: 7
Nice game! I like how the penalty for not achieving the current month's criteria is killing off your worker. Even your buildings have decay if there are no workers in them. If you are not far enough in front of the track, you will most likely be blocked by other players as well leaving you useless actions! This is a very tight game, but with many options of either doing something now or planning for something later. However, I can see that this is a very newbie-unfriendly game as it is very unforgiving and will definitely kill off any new player's fun or confidence if played badly in the first game.

RATING: 8
The first real quality brainburner to come from alea since Puerto Rico, and more of a true "return to form" for the big box line than Notre Dame was.

There are several interesting mechanics here&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;initiative, the disasters, palace management and action grouping&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;and they work well together to create a challenging, nuanced game, although I'd only call it moderately elegant since there [i]are[/i] a lot of them, and I'm not sure I could point to any of them, even the disasters, as the heart of the game.

There is real medium-longish term planning though, which enough to elevate this into a buy for me. It makes my brain hurt in a way that I like, and it promises to scale really well. I look forward to playing many times more. Thanks for bringing it to Canada with you, Gil & Heather.

My least favorite euro game, hands down. So completely full of meaningless rules and restrictions, from the limit on starting with only certain tiles, to only being able to build houses 3 high, to only being able to buy cards a limited number of times, to tiles being bound together for paying a same-action fee. This game would be so much more fun and intuitive if you removed over half of the rules from it, and that is a terrible sign, in my opinion. Also, this is a game where if you fall behind, there is no way to recover properly. I honestly cannot say I enjoy any part of this. Beyond that, more importantly, I can't even find one part of this game that I feel is cleverly designed. That is a huge disappointment, as a game coming from the designer of Castles of Burgundy and Trajan. I can't imagine ever playing this again (currently at 3 plays).

There's also an issue that you can be behind and stay behind.

I see a game with some neat mechanics and a novel way of determining player order through the game.  The list of events and their order gives an opportunity for a level of strategy and playing off the two sides of avoiding disaster befalling your people and actually scoring enough points to win is a delicate balance.  So after two games (and in the 2nd, I scored notably more points than the first) I am liking what I have seen so far.

My wife and regular opponent has doubts about replayability - even with only 2 games she thought there was a sameness - the same events - and the importance of the 'every turn victory points' (the privileges especially) made it a race to get one of those and sit on the advantage that gave.  I am not at all convinced that is unbeatable and hope to play this a good few times.

One of early Feld's that is just OK.  Players are presented with a series of difficult events that happen each game month.  Only two of the 12 months are not problems.

A really good game with plenty of space for tactics and strategy. Very important to plan ahead since there is loads of player interaction and occationally severe backstabbing. The game is quite intense and plays quickly, about an hour+ depending on the number of players with low downtime and high replayability. The only (small) drawback is that it is rather unforgiving towards early mistakes and thereby not really a game for unexperienced players.  

I upgraded the rating from 8 to 9 after my group got into the mechanics, now each game is fresh and a thrilling experience.

This game gives me the same feeling of "too much to do, too few actions" that Agricola did when I first started playing.

Nevertheless, this is a fun game that should stay challenging over repeated plays.

RATING: 7.5
Tried at 2p and it didn't convince me; all seemed quite obvious and plain. At 4p it gets way more interesting, the turn order track is the most tense and strategic  part of the game, because you'll always want to go first when selecting the actions. The action selection, indeed, is not the real core of the game and the open informations make this phase quite predictable. The game is all about choosing the exact right time to perform anything and after all ITYOTD is a pleasant little brain burner, less intriguing than other Feld's masterpieces but still very unique.

ALEA scores again with this: what a challenging balancing act between investing in generating victory points and preventing bad things happening to you. Accept your losses or playing safe? Very tense as an early lead doesn't mean anything.
Furthermore this scales extremely well: obviously it is different playing with 5 than with 2, but always fun.
This game requires building up experience so make sure you don't mix new players with experienced ones.
The "play-by-web" implementation on MaBiWeb is truly excellent [and allows me to at least play this wonderful game frequently - I only log F2F games though]. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
[Played more than 100 times]
Simple premises (pick actions and hire characters to get initiative and more powerful actions), but the usual goal of scoring is achieved more by dodging the nasty events than by creating an economic engine. 

PROs:
-) Fast paced.
-) Quick despite being quite strategic (about 20 minutes per player, once you know it). 
-) Good replay value due to the random order of events and actions.
-) Interesting decisions about who to recruit and how to manage efficiently the initiative track.
-) Several different strategies are workable, thus giving you much to explore.

CONs:
-) Some possibly annoying randomness with the grouping of actions each turn.
-) Extremely unforgiving.
-) Once you have made the first decisions, you may feel constrained to follow that strategy.

Better with more than 2 players (with just 2, it is quite calculable and emphasizes way too much the initiative; it's still nice, but not as good as with more).

A really tense game where you struggle through 12 months through various encounters. If you aren't well prepared, you will lose you hard earned people. Initial rating after only one play and everyone liked it a lot. The rating will most likely rise.

Good game, lots of agonizing choices. Many times you have to pick the lesser of two (or three!) evils, the player who does this best will win.
Update (april 2011): Played 10+ times now, still love the game. Many paths to victory, difficult choices to be made all the time, everything just works very well.
Update 2013: Introduced some other players to the game, and they found out it can be very un-fun if you don't realise the harsh consequences some choices can have. I still like the challenge the game puts before me, but I'm a bit more wary of it now - not a game for every group.

A solid win from Feld. Simply amazing. It's as good or better than many of the games in the Alea series, and much better than his newer titles. It's strategic -- you can't possibly be prepared for every event. There are many choices to balance. IMO this is Feld's very best.

RATING: 5.8
Enjoyable resource planning, but a bit on the frustrating side as the your always up against the gun in hedging against the disaster that's coming. A disaster that everyone shares so everyone is essentially conducting the same maneuvers. So the only real strategy is how you fill your palaces to ensure that you are first in playing your dragon marker. Sure, there is the decision making of which disaster you accept to minimize your loss of VPs. I think this game could be a lot better if their were some kind of negotiation or bribery, and/or the disasters weren't necessarily universal. It would open up to more mind games with your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Game mechanics are superb. Slick and clean. This game brings a lot of tension and competition since there are so many things to do but so little time. And the game is not very forgiving. So its a careful sprint to victory. It doesn't take too long and experienced players will be able to play this game quickly, since there are not too many options each turn.

What I like is that this game doesn't need cards to create complexity. Your own situation, and that of your opponents is always very clear and easy to oversee. Nothing hidden, everything is open on the table. Still this is a game of great depth. 

Because for each game, the events are ordered differently, each play poses different problems and opportunities.

Typically a game that you need to play often to get better. 

Game can be played (and is fun) with any number of people up until 5

Even in 2017 I know no other game that brings more tension to the table than this one;

RATING: 9.5
The theme is really present and give a real life, with the very strong impression of living a hellish years in China. Being constantly on the razor's edge, knowing that each action could be the last one is particularly well rendered here with a good stress. The tension is palpable and intense. Surviving has never been so fun.  Even more difficult is that size and that the sacrifices that would be more painful and not easy to take. We have to find the right tempo to anticipate and survive.

Since the event are never in the same order, and your choice are always affected by other players actions. It's question of making good choices at the right time to win over but mainly to avoid losing too. This dialectic is quite interesting because it is quite different from what we usually encounter in management games. A very original design of the management spices a lot parties, making it extremely tense and difficult choice of each action because if there is one thing that does not support the players, is to know what everybody will do in their efforts development and what sacrifice their are willing to do.

RATING: 6
It makes a big difference to know going-in that this game tries to wear you down, and what's left for the players is a contest of attrition (or survival). Armed with that expectation, this is a thoughtful game with some tough decisions that balance the tactical and strategic. My one game was with five, and I think my rating might improve with fewer players. (Though trying to anticipate what everyone else will do is a great part of the game, I thought it was a little long with the full complement of five players.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent design - tight and tense throughout. It is definitely challenging, but can be a bit stressful.  There is a wonderful synergy between trying to have a high person score to take earlier actions with taking the best persons to help you vs. the disasters.

I've never played a game quite like it: Nearly every turn, something bad happens, and it's all about surviving the nonstop avalanche of bad shit and coming out the least badly off at the end. This is turn angst with the volume turned up -- almost every action is deliciously agonizing, and there's NEVER a perfect choice.

Every aspect of the mechanics, from the role selection to the way the people are balanced and how the disasters unfold, is superb. It's also a beautiful game, component-wise.

I've found that it's not for everyone, though. Folks in my group who normally like games of this complexity level are turned off by the core "avoid the shitslide" gameplay.

Rating based on 4 players.

I seem to like "old" Feld! A really interesting game where the interaction with other players is light yet integral, and the challenge is in facing what the game throws at you. There is a bit of engine building, but that engine constantly changes as you replace workers... or sometimes let them die after they've served their purpose! The feeling is not of creating a smooth-running machine, but of maintaining one that needs constant repairs to lurch along in starts and stops. Some might find that annoying, I find it fun.

Clean, quick and brutal. I really like it, so elegant and simple. Despite the various engine building possibilities, it doesn't really feel like a Feld. Either way, he really nailed it with this one. As an aside, the components, although spartan, are solid. The period art and small footprint are also quite nice. All things considered, I think this is my fourth favorite Feld. So far, I would say: 

1. Macao
2. Trajan
3. Speicherstadt
4. In the Year of the Dragon
5. Notre Dame
6. Luna
7. Brgues (the only Feld I'm not really a fan of)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Loved the tension in this one. I especially love it when i can get this crunchy experience in a Feld that is simple to teach. Visually, it does leave a bit to be desired. It doesn't look nearly as awesome as some of his other offerings, i.e. Aquasphere. ITYOTD looks kinda bland and has minimal pieces. Also, it is true, the Double Privilege is overpowered. Compared to his others, ITYOTD is quite unique in terms of mechanics. Either that'll be refreshing, or it'll feel dated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One play so far (3 player) and my rating will most likely go down. However, I'm really itching to play again to see how different one game can be from the next due to the randomness of the event track and how it plays with a different number of players.

I have a slight concern that the game might become a plodding methodical engine but I'm going to have fun trying to figure it out.

After a couple more plays, it did feel a bit methodical.  Was having a hard time getting it to the table too. 

Traded.

Great game. Frustrated moans around the table from start to finish: Great atmos! :-) In our second game I focused on staying ahead on the turn order track. By mid-game I should probably have switched strategies and focused on points. Now I´m looking forward to trying something else next time. Games that give that feeling after two or three plays are often really good games.

Nice elegant euro from time when even Feld games didn't have 50 mechanics.

* In the Year of the Dragon works well with two, due to the way actions are randomly grouped. For super serious gaming it's not the best player count however (can be 'solved' partly).

RATING: 8
Good Alea game that could be easily taken as an entry game for non gamers. You have to prepare to minimize the consequences of several disasters that will come during the year of the dragon. There is interaction, strategy and planning and your decissions have enough impact on your ming family to understand the consequences of each and every choice without beeing a brain burner.

The first work of Stephan Feld I can taste fullfilled my expectations by far. In the year of the Dragon is a tense game with no luck, cleverly replayable and deep enough to be always a challenge between strategic players. Highly recommended.

This game is very enjoyable and intense, especially in the later rounds if the ending events are tough.  It is hard to survive unscathed so my strategy is to let the poisonous calamities do the least damage.  Each game I've played has gone very differently, which in my mind is a big plus.  After 3 plays, I highly recommend this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played first with two and found it a bit dull. With three players the game got much better. Turn order was very important both to make sure you got what you needed and to block others.

The one thing I don't like so far is that getting an early double favor for $6 (sometime in the first 3-4 rounds) seems entirely necessary to win. But perhaps if all players know this it becomes less of a big deal. Also, the change of that cost to $7 in the new edition seems worth trying. That way you can't get one in round 1 and would need to take money in round 1 to get one in round 2.

RATING: 8
Another wonderful addition to the Alea line; Alea is definitely back on track 2 for 2 for Notre Dame and this!!).  I think this may become a personal favorite and so far it is my favorite game from Essen 07.  There is a lot going on in this game and a lot of different things to balance.  Like many great games, you simply don't have enough time.  Every game will be very different as the event track will really help you formulate a strategy.  Wonderful.  After one play it is on my must have list. After a second play I am wondering if you can have a winning strategy while staying at the bottom of the person track?

This was not even disappointment. I expected nothing and got nothing. How much better this game would have been if the same mechanics had moved to WWII setup and all the upcoming catastrophic events had been bombardments, blitzrieg attacks, running out of machine gun ammo etc. Officers (players) would have negotiatied and begged resources (supply, ammo, recruitment resources etc) from the big generals and gathered experience (scoring) among the way...

4th Feld game I played, and probably the last for a while. Bland euro cubepusher. No correlation between theme and gameplay (we all know drought is gonna strike next semester, en we'll get invaded after that, right...)

Grab points here, chose this action first, because obviously someone else after you wants that action as well, so it won't be around for the next round, do  this to avoid that, etc. Whatever. Yes, it all works, it's been thougt out nicely. But it's as soulless as all the other Feld's I've played so far.

This game is very cleverly designed, consisting of only very few minor random elements that affects the final outcome. The game really tests the players wisdom and strategical knowledge. Each game is taking place in a random generated year, consisting of different happenings each month, which greatly improves the replay value and is making the strategical difficulty of the game much harder.

RATING: 3
I think this is a slightly below average example of the blah that is the Eurogame. There's my usual pet peeve about artificial restrictions on purchasing items. Only one person can purchase fireworks, or rice, or whatever. It feels wrong to me, and thus is distracting, because there's no reason for it except as something the designer uses for play balance.

It is a challenging game that requires you to plan ahead and pay attention to the series of calamities/challenges ahead. Scheduled calamities, there's a concept. Ultimately, this may be the thing that turns me off the most and drops it to a 4: The "scheduled" calamities are such an artifice, so completely anti-immersive, I just don't feel like I'm doing anything. I never enter--or even approach--a state where I forget that I'm playing a game. Did I say 4? Eh, let's make it a 3.

So once again, a meh game which is an okay optimization/resource management game, with long- and short-term strategies and some screwage, but it doesn't really feel like you're doing anything. Admittedly, this is not an issue for everyone, but it is an issue for me.

I think this is one of those titles about which it is perfectly acceptable to simply say: a typical Euro. If that statement causes a strong reaction in you either way, you may already know everything you need to decide whether you would like this game.

New and fresh. Great entry in the 60 minutes category -- lots of decisions, little luck, tense but not overhwelmingly so. Lots to do in 12 short turns. Unfortunately the game arc suffers a bit from the action selection mechanism, as in the later turns (especially the last 3 turns) there is much less tension in trying to figure out which character to select and which action to pick -- some of the nasty events won't be recurring so deciding which characters to get rid of is much easier, and the decision tree for which character to pick is much leaner due to having that many less character cards left in your hands. Still, a satisfying playing experience.

Players familiar with Feld's last game will be familiar with the rat phase at the end of each round.  Basically you need to deal with the rats or else they'll take away some of your influence and victory points.  Feld's latest design utilizes that same mechanic but increases your chance for failure by introducing different threats to contend with round by round.  You'll need to collect different commodity types depending on the upcoming threats.  The catch is that those commodities are in short supply especially considering you can only collect one type per round and your opponents are also competing for them.

The other challenge, of course, is besides trying to keep your ship afloat you need to try to squeeze in some victory points.  Problem is that this is usually to the detriment of dealing with the hazards each round.  

A challenging game with some nice mechanics.  I didn't even mention the turn-order track which is something else players compete in and really adds to the game.  Although I mentioned a ton of conflict it truly is a euro.  Some may say it's Notre Dame with meat.

UPDATE: After 3 plays this one is already losing it's appeal.  It's much longer than Notre Dame or at least it feels that way.  Knocked down a point.  UPDATE: after further play the game has revealed that it really has no catch-up mechanism.  This isn't always a huge problem but in this one it's dull to continue playing when it's a foregone conclusion or you know you don't have a chance to win half-way through.  Knocked down another 1/2 point.

This is a classic Feld and I do like it. I need to play it again to see how different it feels with the events shuffled around. I didn't feel like there was a lot of tension from the disasters, but then my point engine failed to bring victory, so perhaps I was playing too defensively. I'll have to change it up in future plays. Solid game, I think. The setup is slightly onerous, and I'm not sure if it will ever stand in front of Trajan or Bruges as my choice to play, but it will see more play.

Update: Bruges is out and ITYOTD is in. This game has proved to be dry yet cool and is moving up. 6.75 => 7.5.

This game continues the tradition from Stefan Feld (Notre Dame) of games that don't so much challenge you to gain the most of all the players, but to be impacted by disasters the least. Most of your effort is just in keeping your head above water. The winner will be the one who is able to do that and hold on to just a little bit of energy to make upward progress.

I think these games are predecessors to Agricola. In Agricola, feeding your family is a large part of the game, although perhaps not the majority, and the only purpose of it is to avoid a stiff negative penalty if you can't.

I like this one better than Notre Dame, probably because it has some more familiar Euro mechanics, and also more interaction. There's interaction in Notre Dame, but it's very subtle - pass cards you don't want, but at least secondarily, don't pass cards your opponent will want.

Im Jahr der Euro-Generika! This game is ok, I even managed to do well at it, but it is another Euro game with a small array of choices that mount up to important decisions that will have a massive influence on your path through the game. And that kind of thing just doesn't appeal to me, I am generally incapable of spotting viable long term paths in abstract games. The potential variety in the 'disaster' order is probably interesting for those who will play this 10 times, but I suspect I will not be a member of that elite group. This is the same Euro concepts, just thrown together in a different order and with different bits, when will the deluge stop?

It was surprising to me that I pulled the trigger on getting rid of this game, though I had gotten rid of another Feld previously ([b][GameID=25554][/b]), so there was some precedence.  I feel like I may have given this game short shrift, but it just seemed too brutal and unforgiving for me to really enjoy it.  This belongs on my very short list of games I've gotten rid of that I'd like to try again in the future...

Good game with nice components (I love dragons! Although they don't really have much to do with the game itself). Interesting mechanic of having the action point and scoring point tracks separate. Strategy is largely dictated the order in which the Events show up. I'd like to play it again.

RATING: 7.5
Played once.  Players attempt to recruit people to work in their castles, while producing resources to avoid disasters.  While the game mechanics of this are fun, the game has a lot of player interaction (fighting over limited resources), and requires a lot of (yet not too much) planning ahead; it is also completely unforgiving of mistakes.   In the first game I played one player ended the game with, quite literally, no people or castles at all.  And he hadn't had people since about turn 6. Most other people in the game had ended up making a mistake that cost them a lot of victory points as well.  So, while it's fun (and I'd love to play it again), its unforgivingness might be a bit too much (as there appear to be multiple negative events that can occur which are unrecoverable from).

El orden del turno, los bloqueos en la selección de acciones, el uso de personajes y su doble valor (rendimiento y orden de turno), el número de palacios y su altura, los eventos y la decadencia de los palacios completan un amplio conjunto de variables a tener en cuenta. Estamos ante un juego duro, no solo es una combinación de variables en un turno determinado, las situaciones se nos echan encima una tras otra modificando nuestro set de acciones, obligando a jugar con la vista sobre los 10 eventos de final de turno. Compartir mesa con jugadores con experiencia en In the Year of the Dragon hará aumentar su dureza. La experiencia en este juego es un grado.

Interesting game where you mainly try to stay alive dodging various catastrophe (and they said that the Year of the Dragon was a lucky one ...).
Just one small problem: it is an extremely unforgiving game, pretty much no way to get back into the race if you make a mistake; that's not a crippling bias as the lenght is about 15/20 min per player.
Another 'soso' impression: some choices really seem worse than other (it became quite clear after a dozen of games so not too bad after all)

Rating likely to go down, but we'll see.  Mechanically, it works well, but lin later turns looks like you can calculate exactly how much each move is worth, which is likely to put me off repeated play.  Based on one play with 2 players - will try with more players before coming to a final decision.

A Burgundy és a Notre Dame után egy újabb Feld-remekművet vártam. Hát, nem az lett belőle.

Monoton. Nem kicsit, nagyon. Nem érzem a választás szabadságát sem az akcióknál, hiszen mindig "kötelezően" azt választja az ember, amivel a kör végi csapást minimalizálhatja. Ha egyáltalán tudja, mivel - és ezt úgy látom, hogy többen szóvá tették, teljesen jogosan - aki hátracsúszik a körsorrend végére, szinte kilátástalan helyzetbe kerül. Magyarul már a 2-3. kör végén lehet látni, hogy ki lesz az utolsó a 12. kör után. Ez azért lássuk be, a kiválóan kibalanszolt pontozású eurós játékok mezőnyében borzasztó hátrány egy játéknál (nem beszélve a frusztrációról, amit okoz).

Több játék után is úgy érzem, hogy többet lehet, hogy nem is próbálkozom vele. Ezen a játékon még Menzel mester artworkje sem nagyon tudott javítani...

I love games with lots of hard choices. This game is one of those "constantly plugging leaks" triage kinds of games--you can't conquer all the stuff the game throws at you, so you just have to make sure you come through OK and that your opponents suffer more. It has a flavour a bit like Caylus, except that unlike Caylus it has a decent randomization system (random initial setup plus the actions are grouped differently every turn) to prevent staleness. It's still not a hugely various game, though, because the 12 actual events occur invariably--it's just the ordering that changes--so multiple games can be a little samey if you don't play with expansions.

My first Feld, and probably my favorite as of now.  Only because I believe it has the best theme integration of his games I've played and the expansion really helped in that regard as well.  But to be honest, he is my favorite designer, and there are many others that are excellent games as well (i.e. Aquashpere, Bora Bora, Castles of Bugrundy, Macao and Trajan just to name a few).

With the expansion (or  10th anniversary edition) 9/10, without 8.5/10.

RATING: 9
Very good game, almost no luck involved yet the game manage to play a bit differently from one game to another thanks to the variable position of the events.

Player interaction is present via the different actions available (as the players after the first have to pay to use an already chosen action group), the character points track and the limited supply of advanced characters of each type.

I really enjoy it, but some players in my playgroup do not like it as much, I guess they do not like the constant struggle feeling as you always have to make sacrifices.

This is a really great game that has players combating negative scenarios throughout the game. Since it's a core part of the game, they don't seem negative. There is always a bit of bad going around, but it is best to avoid extreme slides into that negativity. In this way, the game can be a bit unforgiving. However, you can use this against your opponents. The game offers several interesting decisions each turn and the components and theme are nice.

Really enjoy this one. This is a short, sweet, and straight-forward Euro all about crisis management. It hits a nice sweet spot for my tastes.

Il semble très difficile de revenir de l'arrière. Le début de la partie est très important et il faut à tout prix éviter les erreurs. Cela affecte ma note pour ce jeu: lors de mes deux parties, j'ai rapidement constaté que je ne pouvais plus gagner, et j'avais hâte que la partie soit terminée.

EDIT 2016-03: Note de 7.3 (avril 2014) redescendue pour une deuxième fois.

[COLOR=#003300]"If you make a mistake (e.g. don't have enough money to take an action that has already been selected), it's pretty much game over. Not only do you get stuck not being able to take the action that you desperately need), but you will probably lose some of your people which will snowball into more problems and losses later. If you are behind, you can't catch up. People in the lead on the turn order track will always get the action they want and will continue to get further ahead making it impossible to catch them. 

People who get the double scroll on turn one are probably going to win... especially if they pick up books.[/color]" - [xnardnkita]

RATING: 8.3
An extremely solid game. The turn order track is innovative, and unlike other traditional euro that lets you develop over time, the game is full of destruction which rewards you for abandoning resources wisely, which in turns requires a much more detailed long-term plannings. The game by nature is perfect information, but the variable set up makes it interesting over time as well.

Despite my love of the game, several of my playmates dislike the game as its nature makes them feel they are hopeless. 

Update: Just played once after long break. I love it even more as after playing all the new games I find it's really elegant and balanced, and the different order of disaster tile really make every gams unique. It's a classic to me!

Update 2: The addition of great wall expansion makes 5-player game a bit better.

I am not great with strategy games and many times do not like them as much as I feel I should.  But, I really enjoyed this game.  The game forces you to plan out your strategy early and ride it through to the end, hoping you do not get road blocked too much by your opponent.  I may get this game into my collection, but am being held back by the outdated component quality in the 10th anniversary edition.

Alea games keeps bringing nothing new to the table. I had higher expectations for this game, but in the end, it's another Alea.  It was much more easy to play than I was told. Fun game though... probably I like it more than Goa... which means this could be my favorite Alea game.

In medieval China, players are attracting workers to their temples to survive one calendar year, where there are attacks by Mongols, drought, and contagion. In the action phase, players choose from the following: research (earn VPs through scholars), build (build a palace segment), fireworks (earn fireworks counters), money (take money), helmets (move up higher on the turn order track), rice (take rice counters), and prestige (buy a scroll to earn 1 or 2 VPs a month). These are performed in player order, and if another player wants to do another action that someone has taken, they must pay three gold. In the person phase, players recruit a worker into their temples. Each player has an 11 person deck, with 9 cards representing the unique personalities in the game, and 2 cards are wild cards. The workers are split into two categories, the younger that can do more, while the older are worth more prestige, and help the player in the action phase for turn order. Each month, there is a scoring, based on temples, number of court ladies, and scrolls a player has. At the end of the game, there is a final scoring, counting monks and 2 VPs per worker.

This is a good game, with tense decisions to be made as one tries to weather the contagions, Monguls, tribute, or drought. One has to adapt to the monthly problems, and trying to be able to stay ahead of everyone else to go first in the action phase. Fun, engaging, and each game is different, as the monthly problems are seeded differently as well. 

This game has a steep learning curve, but it is a tense game. It's different from other games in that instead of building up people or economy, you are likely to be losing people due to the calamities.

This was before I became a hardcore gamer, so the rules were a little difficult at first and I couldn't create a good strategy. It also felt like downtime was a little high but I may be misremembering. Overall, nothing struck me as too cool other than the theme.

RATING: 9
OK, so after ten or so plays this is shaping up to be a very positive surprise indeed. ItYoD really itches in all the right euro places for me. Very euro, very good - it has good execution, good theme, a small analysis paralysis risk for those inclined to that (but otherwise fast because of the repeating four phases), you always feel on the edge, and you know that if (& when) you do something stupid you'll suffer for it. The good thing is that so will everyone else. The games I've played insofar has been immensely tight and the winner has always won by max 5 VPs.

My wife's rating: 9 "Great game, but I can't seem to win!!?"

An different and interesting game. Players build and populate Palaces in order to survive a series of Events that can earn you points or cost you money and/or patrons. 

In the 2-player game, I felt more like I was playing against the game's Event tiles than against my opponent. As the first player, I was able to take a quick lead in play order and the hold it just enough to remain first player. My choices would then affect the second player, but his never came into play against me. 

Edit: Played 2-player again with very different tactics for each of us. Much closer game and more direct competition. This is a great game.

RATING: 8
Tense game of crisis management which punishes poor planning instead of bad luck.  Full of agonizing decisions, much like Notre Dame from the same designer.  The game is not merciful, but it also lacks the fun-murdering death spiral sensation of Gloria Mundi and La Citta.  I'm very pleased with it.  New players should be advised that constantly going last is pretty much a death sentence.

This could be as good as Puerto Rico or even better.  I love the fact that you have to fight for turn order in this game.  It's essential to go first as often as you can, but you need to balance the turn order vs. the strength of your tableau.  What an awesome game!

A big balancing act where you need to pick your poisons and hope they don't end up hurting you too much.  The game feels restrictive, and that certainly drives a lot of the angst.

RATING: 1
Played a 4 player and a 5 player. I found the game rigid and agonizing. Unlike some of Feld's other games (CoB, Macao), this one doesn't seem to have the same freedoms of action in terms of paths to victory. In fact, if you are last or second to last in the fluctuating turn order, you're not going to win (at least I don't think so), so you must take person cards that assure you a 2nd, or better yet, first choice the majority of the time. In addition, because the calamities affect everyone, players tend to want the exact same actions at the same time. The game feels crowded and narrow as a result, with decisions forced upon each player at a tactical level; worse, both times I played I didn't find it fun. I do want to give this game another shot to explore different strategies, but I'm worried it'll be more satisfying as a thought exercise than in the actual playing. [Comes with Great Wall & SuperEvents expansion for trade] 
-----
Every time I open the box I'm flooded with bad memories. I think I hate this game. And now it's been traded away.
-----
Perversely, I want to play this one again. Go where it is darkest. I ended up liking [i]Morvern Callar[/i] and [i]Demonlover[/i] quite a bit on a second viewing, even though they drove me crazy when I watched them in the theaters.
-----
Now I have reacquired, it lays fallow
-----
Finally played it again, 3p. Since being first matters so much, the game probably plays best with 2 or 3 -- especially if people know what to do (i.e., they've either discovered the winning formula, or read about it). The winning formula being, pick 6 monk and 5 warrior/5 firework in order to go first, then choose double privilege to gain a 2 point advantage. The game remains tightly scripted from there, with variations only arising based upon the initial layout of the events and which actions get grouped together. It's not a bad experience if you're the one who gets that initial advantage; it's hell if you're one of the other players, especially in a 5p game, as you sit helplessly watching the gap grow wider between the leader and you. Maybe with 2p it can be more of a match.

a less tactical (more strategic) version of notre dame - optimizing to avert disasters this time, with several paths to victory. It also plays quickly (1 hour for 3 players a little longer with more at the table) and it is excellent with 3, 4 or 5 players.
This is a game that should be expanded to be playable with 6 players by providing 1 or 2 more of the various helpers.
For me this is the best game from the year 2007.

RATING: N/A
All my plays have been with the SoloPlay rules, which are really good.

This is a near perfect information game.  You are fully aware of all the impending disasters, from invasion by Mongols, plague, and taxation (even in a game, the government gets its' due).  You know which people you can hire.  You also can see what everyone else is doing. What makes it near perfect is the randomized grouping of actions each turn.

This one feels like tiptoeing through a minefield.  If you're successful, what a thrill.

Many times you are forced to remove people from your play area (palaces).  Many people seem to dislike this. I don't mind it; Being a professional musician, I'm used to being treated like a commodity.  I get hired to come in, play with "band", and then leave.  The contractor has no more need for me, so no hard feelings.  It may be the disastrous nature of the events that force your hand which causes people angst.

No rating yet - need to play more, but I enjoy it thus far.

Reminds me of the feeling I get when I play Parthenon. You know bad stuff is going to happen, and you're just minimizing the damage. Knowing when everything is coming allows for better planning, but the order can really affect how it works out.

RATING: 8.4
Great game, it has almost all the virtues: it's fast, very easy rules, strategic, tactic, interaction, minimal luck factor and depending on the positioning the event tiles (and also the action cards), games can be very different, allowing a great replayabilty.

The character (initiative) track is what makes this game work. If you play the ideal cards (and then actions), most likely someone will overtake you and you'll not be able to take the actions you want.

My rating will likely increase with further plays.

RATING: 8
(I also own expansion from "Alea/Rio Grande Chest")

Game seems to be all about struggling from a misery into another. It's a resource optimization at heart but struggling gives a bit different spirit to the game. I like the combination of planning & luck of a draw in the game. You know which crisis will hit on each month but you cannot predict which actions are stacked together so you should have a flexible plan to cope with the uncertainty. A very good optimization game and seems to scale well to all player amounts.

Update (17.8.2008): The game works quite nicely as a 6-player game too (you need extra pieces / cards for the sixth player). It's a bit different experience and naturally takes longer but is still playable.

Update (3.10.2010): The game works somewhat as 2-player game but most of the game's annoyances are enhanced when played like this. More stuff is blocked by pure luck when 1. player chooses his pile and turn order is therefore extra important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Based on 2 games, both 2-player. Enjoying it more and more every time, it's a tight game that punishes mistakes, but not as bad as others (La Citta, for instance). Rating may go up but I need to play it more, and against more people.

RATING: 8
The quality evident in both the design and the imagery make this another solid winner from Alea.The game mainly has the feel of barely treading with one head above the water. There are lots of potentials in what to do, but only a limited number of actions with which to do them. The game is balanced between trying to go earlier within a turn and thus claiming the action you want versus going later, but being able to potentially do more with that action. Also, certain actions need to be taken to offset a disastrous event (8 of the 12) or to try and benefit from a beneficial event (2 of the 12). It is this precarious balance between short-term benefits versus long-term needs that gives the game its tension and also puts it head and shoulders above most of the other Euros.I can easily see this one becoming one of my top three games.

Pretty challenging game with lots of hard decisions to make and a constant "angst!" feeling of not having enough time/resources to do all you want to do.
Very curious mechanism used to pick your first tiles, which doesn´t allow the players to choose the same combinations that have been already picked by others. This avoid what otherwise could be a very scripted start and forces players to find alternative ways to achive theír goals.

RATING: 8
There seems to be a couple of constant threads through Stefan Feld's output. In the Year of the Dragon illustrates them extremely well, and does so without necessarily resorting to an overwhelming amount of material:
* A SIMPLE CORE IDEA. Players must allocate different workers within their palaces (which can be expanded as well) to protect themselves against a series of disasters that will happen throughout the game: each of the months of a year every player will choose an action and recruit a worker using cards. A player's hand only allows to recruit one worker of each kind and two free choices; two more workers are chosen for the setup. 
* MANY OPTIONS FOR SEVERAL ASPECTS IN THE GAME. There are five different deadlines that happen twice throughout the year, seven different actions and nine kinds of workers, each of them with different implications and some of them divided in seniors and juniors.
* NOT ENOUGH TIME TO MEET ALL THE DEADLINES.

The result is, as frequently stated for Stefan Feld, a rich and cerebral game that takes one try to assimilate, two or three to have fun with and two hundred to play really well. There are multiple possible strategies, which work differently with a different amount of players, and only the setup order can be called random. The turn order mechanic (a secondary scoring track) is the game's secret weapon: the available actions are few, and if they have been taken before in the turn they're also costly. This forces players to balance as carefully as possible between picking up strong actions and securing early slots. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Probabilmente il più bel gioco di Feld di sempre. Un gioco semplicissimo ma profondo e estremamente punitivo. Il gioco dura 12 turni ed in ogni turno bisogna svolgere 4 fasi:
1. Scegliere una tessera azione
2. Giocare una carta e prendere il relativo lavoratore
3. Risolvere l'evento (solitamente negativo)
4. Assegnare i punti vittoria.
Gli eventi sono noti dall'inizio della partita e i giocatori cercheranno di costruire la loro strategia in base all'ordine di successione. Un gioco molto interessante e cattivo. Promosso a pieni voti.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The classic Euro game of continual resource denial. Some aspects are rather sweet - and surprisingly thematic, knowing the little that I do about Chinese politics - and there is definitely no lack of action economy! But it seems worryingly easy to identify a runaway leader (even if that's not the person who is nominally in the lead at midgame), and you have to consequently question the enjoyment value of playing the game through its full 90-minute span.

Oh boy, I hated this game when we played it the first time. It sat on the shelf for years not played and when I would pass by the game I would look on it with disgust. 

Well fast forward to 2014. I decided to give it a fresh start. And now, I think it is a really nice game with excellent strategic challenges. And it is a great medium weight game that can easily be played on a busy week night. It is a tough game, if you get behind on the first player track...it can really hurt you and you may never get another opportunity to catch up. It pays to take a character from the display that may be young and inexperienced, just to stay ahead on the first player track.

It throws up some nice planning challenges, with decisions to make re what to focus on and what to give up on. It's sadly pretty themeless, but having differing disaster sequences provides decent variety from game to game. It's not a game I look forward to playing because it's depressing having to fight off disasters all game, but conversely, I don't mind it when it's pulled out due to the different strategic options available.

Got this as present. Rating after first play: We played this in 4 and found everything working fine. Each mechanism in the game makes sense and everything fits together well. It is a optimization game. Still it does lack some feeling. It left me cold. So my rating may go up or down with additional play.
Update: Raised my vote to 8 because slowly this game is growing on me!
Update: This game just gets better with each additional game. Did I really say this game lacks feeling? Wow, I was really wrong. It is really nailbiting to decide which action to take and whom to dismiss from the own kingdom.

I love the Chinese-inspired theme of this game, and I like that you know from the beginning which order the events will occur.  It is not hard to learn, and players do the same series of actions in each of twelve rounds: choose an action, play a person card, resolve the event, and score.

Neat optimization game where you try to squeeze victory point collection into the small spaces in between dodging all the obstacles the game throws at you.  Often you'll want to address an issue right before it nails you, but since everyone wants to do that, it makes it more difficult.

Very good game.  It had a lot of tough decisions, surprisingly more interaction with the blocking or jockeying for position, and a challenge with getting hosed in various parts.  I felt the game had a stronger balance between strategies.

One of these "Much to do but no time to do it" games.
Board overlay don't bother me, it looks practical enough and works fine too.
The choosing of actions is one I truly dislike though. It basically annoys me because there isn't too much money in the game to buy one of the action-pair action where someone already is...

Quite similar with many other Alea-games. Quite nice but no reason to be thrilled.

After second 4-player game, raised rating from 6 to 7.

Played only a [i]two player[/i] game and I liked it very much, but it didn't work that [i]well[/i] with only two players. The rating is therefor an estimate of how I [i]think it plays[/i] with more players - I'll have to get back to this rating though, when I've had the chance to play it with more players... The problem with the game with only two players is that if one player gets even a [i]small lead[/i] he'll/she'll almost certainly be able to hold on to that lead for the rest of the game.
Otherwise; I love the fact that there's just [i]so much[/i] to do and so little time and that you can't completely survive all the bad things that happen each month - you just have to choose when you're gonna take the fall. Another great [b]eurogame[/b] from Alea.

An incredibly stressing game (in the good sense): surviving 12 turns full of calamities (famine, invasions, taxes) while competing with fellow players for the resources that ease the pain, makes for a very engaging and tense game. Add to this a good mix of different game mechanisms, not too complex rules, good production values, and you have an excellent example of German-style development games.

Stefan Feld's masterpiece !!

This is the most unique game of Stefan Feld and feels very different from all other typical Eurogames.

In this game you fight against catastrophes and you try to survive as best as you can.

Complex, deep, but easy to understand.

Artwork is poor, but it is to be expected from Feld games...

IMO one of the best eurogames of all time.

No comments on this one, eh..

So this was my 'best new game of the month' in April 2008 (iicrc) and enjoyed my game of it.  Unfortunately, I haven't played since.

The nature of the game is one of those 'save a burning building' kind of games, where you are constantly getting attacked and you have to do your best to protect yourself or survive from it.. Sort of like Gloria Mundi and the Downfall of Pompeii (but DoP rates higher).  I'd like to play again, and like most games in my collection, with more than just one opponent.

Just played one game of this and the person track seemed really important. Lots of tough decisions and you inevitably need to make sacrifices. Components are too small. I ran away with the game by taking control of the person track but I expect with more experienced players I would have more competition and it would be harder. I like the very low luck. Some beginning decisions may be scripted (too early to tell but large privilege and lots of person points to get ahead on person track seem like obvious choices). I like the choice between old and young people. (Reminiscent of El Grande power cards).

Demands experienced players but shines with such.

In the Year of the Dragon (ItYotD) is a game for masochists. ItYotD is brutality incarnate. This is a game that hammers on its players and doesn't let up for no one! Stefan Feld is an evil genius. To win the game players must plan and sacrifice to climb out of the ashes and rise like a phoenix reborn. ItYotD is awesome.

Nice euro, but I was frustrated that I could still gain a sizable lead even as my engine feel apart. Another player just built several scholars and did the scholar action over and over to gain a large point lead. The disasters are annoying, but they don't necessarily hurt your point score, it seems that you can mostly ignore them and still win.

This is an extremely tight worker placement game about mitigating the disasters that will hit you every round starting turn 3, while still trying to maintain a good point income. Each round you take the player actions and divide them into groups equal to the number of players, which means sometimes when you take an action you make a choice between two possibilities. Then each person gets to play a card allowing them to select one of the people tiles to add to their tableau. These people either help you mitigate the events, or get you points. Then you resolve the punishing event effect that forces you to potentially discard your people titles and then you score some points. This game can be very unforgiving of mistakes and you need to keep up with other player's point generation engines. There isn't really a catchup mechanism in this game, which can feel a little hopeless for the players not doing well. Despite this, it's a tight, punchy game full of suffering which is something I can appreciate.

I doubt I will ever consider playing Notre Dame again, as this is a superior game with similar mechanics. The games mechanics are easy to understand. This is a game of crisis management. One mistake can totally unravel your whole game and destroy you utterly as I learned the hard way. I can't think of many other euros that are this unforgiving of mistakes, except maybe age of steam. Yet it keeps you coming back for more. There is an element to this game that makes you feel like you're playing against the game not the other players. A highly enjoyable time. We've seen people win from the front and back in turn order, however it is much more difficult from the back. There is an imbalance to the game from the first turn onwards in that the last player to go (determined randomly) can take a character combination that will assure him frist place in turn order and buy a double privilage. That is 24 points as a result of a random draw.

A series of unfortunate events take place while you try to squeeze out some victory points. Very dry and abstract.

This whole killing off the players you draft just isn't appealing.

Cute enough little game.  Seems too programmed to me, like someone can find a few good routes to high scores and all else will be lesser by comparison.

RATING: 7.5
This seems like a complicated game due to the many ways to recieve points (pt) to win.  You receive points by the following means:  1 pt for each castle per turn, 1 pt for each cortison per turn, 1 pt for each script (buy 1 or 2 pt script) per turn and at the end of the game you get 1 pt for every three sets of items or coins, 2 pts for every worker and 1 pt per castle floor you have a monk in it.

I was behind by 10 points and still won with last turn results: (10 workers x 2 pts = 20 pts; castle with 3 floors (max of 3 floors) x 1 monk pt = 3 pts; 4 castles x 1 pt = 4 pts; 1 cortison x 1 pt = 1 pt; 3 fireworks/3 = 1 Pt and 9 Yen/3 = 3 pts, for a total of 32 pts received on the last turn.).

There is a learning curve and, even though the actions are easy, if players aren't paying attention, important steps can be missed but over all, this is a solid game and I'm glad to have it in the collection.

Solid decision making, player interaction and a straight forward but nuanced economics engine. My only concern is that, with so little hidden information (not really any hidden information at all) there are probably calculable elements AND the potential for petty politics (in what tiles people take)

definitely want to play it more

Role selection, worker placement, and palace building in this game of difficult decisions. Finding the right balance between development for VP scoring and preparation for upcoming disasters is key.

Plays a bit like a resource management game except your not only building something but also having it torn down.    overall, good game not the most appealing but very unique.  interesting but I'm not sure it's actually fun.

 Rather unforgiving to the first-time player, but once you figure out how things work you're struggling with the situation and not the system. Rife with tough decisions and trade-offs. Seems extraordinarily deep, with no obvious path to victory.

RATING: N/A
One of the worst gaming experiences ever for me.  After I drove 11 hours to get to Origins, I just wanted to look at all of the everyone/every game/everything, but Tim insisted we play this complicated game that the rest of us didn't know at all.  A classic Tim (R.I.P.) move.  I've ended up loving Feld as a designer, but I have no intention of playing this one again.

RATING: 6
Place the ten disasters/opportunities on the track in a random order. Each turn players choose an action and a particular type of loyal follower. These interact to generate food, fire-works, victory points, etc. This is a planning game, in which you look ahead and try to work out what you will need and when, and optimise it against the production of victory points.
The game is a bit fiddly on your first play, but after that the choices are fairly simple (you have only two on each turn, one is a choice of seven actions in which usually some are clearly not worthwhile, and one is a choice is essentially choosing an order in which a set of cards are resolved over the game). 
It can be a bit lacking in flavour but it deserves more plays to establish how much depth there is to the strategy.

This game was long on the wishlist of my wife and I (we're both big Feld fans, but only got into gaming in 2011), but it is long out of print and totally unavailable, at least in the UK. Luckily, my wife managed to buy an unused German-language edition from a BGG user in December 2013 - the components are language-independent and English rules are available online, so it is completely playable.

We've played a few times, all shortly after getting it, and all with just 2 - it is an interesting game, and is definitely recognisable as a Feld design. It does show its age a little, I feel, but is still very enjoyable - once you know the game then 2-player has very little downtime, it is very replayable as the order of events makes a big difference to how one approaches things, and I would very much like to try this with more than 2 players (although I also think it's a very good 2-player game). But that still hasn't happened, nor have my wife and I played it again as a 2p, since those first few games in 2013 - there are too many other games we want to play, and the fact that we don't have printed English rules to refer to doesn't help.

(+) Very elegant game: a lot of game compared to the rather small set of rules
(+) Original mechanism: the 10 disasters which are foreseen, the dynamic between player order and which kind of staff members you choose, ... It works fluently and makes for a very interesting game
(+) Very flexible: the game is easily explained, does not take long to play, is accessible to casual gamers yet also satisfying for "hardcore gamers".
(+) Very low/no luck-factor
(+) Considering this is a Feld-title, the theme is ok

(-) Game material is really, *really* crappy
(-) Chosing the right starting cards seems very crutial and this might benefit the random turn order in the set-up phase.

Approx gametime: 30 min / player

Everything you love to hate about Notre Dame, namely the rat problem. Or is that hate to love? This is a somewhat dry (which is OK in my book), unforgiving exercise in survival. Taken in that spirit, it's a whole lotta fun. Scales surprisingly well, and even works nicely for 2. Nice-looking production, though I wish the cards and tiles were linen finished.

A Notre Dame nagyon tetszik, ami ugyanennek a szerzőnek a műve. Ez viszont kifejezetten csapni való.
Mindig az események után szaladsz, és csak kármentés folyik. Nem a plusz pontok elérése lesz belőle, hanem a negatívumok minimalizálása.
De legnagyobb probléma, hogy teljesen kiegyensúlyozatlan ez a játék. Ha a játék elején a legkisebb hátrányba kerülsz, tuti vesztes vagy. Esélyed sincsen arra, hogy ne az utolsó 2 hely vmelyikét csípd el.

8.1.14 A fine game in it's own right. The only real issue I have with this game is that the only real tension comes from the challenges that come at the end of the rounds. They are all known so you can "see" what others are driving at and what you can do. Still, there is some tension in trying to get the action you want to avoid these, but there just seems like it needs more for me. I will still play this and do enjoy it, but for now, I don't it see getting into our gaming rotation.

What's great about this game is that the theme works, unlike in Notre Dame where it seems forced and without logic. Here there's no fiddliness, straightforward rules which can be easily committed to memory, and no card text or elaborate iconography to deal with.  I completely cocked up the end-game on my most recent playing and came a distant last, but that was my fault for poor planning. Balanced, interactive, streamlined, relatively quick and very replayable. Works well with any number of players from 2-5.

So many things you want to do in your turn, but you are strictly limited. Tough choices! Virtually no randomness. The random setup of the order of events gives a big influence on what follows, much more than the random setup of the 6 pink buildings in Caylus. We played it with 4 and with 2, and enjoyed both ways.

Yet another Chinese background game wrapped in a German style mechanic. The Year of Dragon is really a disasterous year : drought, heavy taxes, plague, mongol invasions... The keynote of the game is to avoid those events and prevent your guests from dying. Usually mortality is inavoidable, so if you can control your death rate at no more than 1 person each month, you will probably have a good chance of winning... It takes a lot of preplanning and interaction. Shorting of 1 Yuan can mean losing of many points. Concerning this, the game is really not suitable for newbies...

This is hands down amongst Feld's top 3 games. Simple to play, super streamlined, but it offers a ton of depth. I love how strategic it is and how tight everything feels. The two little expansions with the Great Wall and the Super Events are absolutely essential imo. I am sooo glad that I didn't forget about this game and that my common sense told me to get it again. A masterpiece.

Disaster management and victory point engine generation. You can see the recycling of ideas from Rum and Pirates (without the dice and movement mechanic), and Notre Dame (victory point engine generation and character roles). Although it's just an exercise in victory point accumulation and disaster management it's a very decent and balanced game in its own right. Nothing overly special, but you can play different ways each time and the order of the events mixed up each game means you can play this puzzle many times before you'll tire of it. Lots of bits. Some really good player interaction is possible in games, especially with two or three players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very nice game of planning and thinking ahead, in which players try to achieve the best of the worst that can happen to them.  It is very tense and cutthroat.  However, the simplicity of the mechanics of the turn and the fact that there are twelve rounds confabulate for the game to feel a little bit repetitive after a while.  Besides, I believe there is a kind of snow ball efect that may kick some players out of the race for the win early in the game.

I think the key here is knowing going into it that you won't be able to do everything you want to, and you will lose people.

RATING: 8
The game takes place over twelve rounds, each representing a month on the year. The first two months are "peaceful," and then subsequent months have randomized events, two each of: war, famine, drought, plague and (for a nice change) fireworks. You can see which order these will happen in, allowing you to plan out a strategy for the game. Each player has two, two-story pagodas, allowing them to hire four people (one per story). Each person they have enhances the actions they take. For instance, if you take the Farm Rice action, you'll produce 1 rice tile (in preparation for famine), but if you have a Rice Farmer in your house, you'll produce more. The game has two tracks, a scoring track and a turn order track, which is kind of interesting. Acquiring people affects your advance on the turn order track. There are young and old versions of most people. The young people produce less, but they advance you more. The old people do the reverse.

Turn order comes into play when you take your actions. There are seven actions, and they're randomly split into N groups (where N is the number of players). In player order, you select an action and block out the whole group. Going last in turn order means you'll be forced to take an action you don't want, or you'll have to pay cash to force your way into a previously selected group to get the action you want. Some of these actions are let you build (adding more stories to your pagodas or adding more pagodas -- this action is enhanced by having builder people living in your pagodas already), make fireworks (having fireworks people living in your house helps you produce more of them), make money (enhanced by moneychangers in your house), and move farther on the turn order track (enhanced by having warriors in your house, which are also good for when war comes around).

The events are resolved each turn, some of the event consequences are more dire than others, but they usually involve killing off some of the people in your house or taking your money. This is interesting game about long and short term planning. You know you war is coming, so you want to have more warriors in your house than your opponents by the time in gets here. You see both plague events are hitting one after another, so there will be a mad rush to pick up healers at that time -- maybe pick them up in advance to avoid the rush? But then you run out of space in your pagodas and have to evict someone when you pick up a new person for your house, so you've got to build. But building goes faster if you have builders in your house, so you could pick them up first, then build, then evict them when the time comes and you need the space...

I like how this game has many strategies for victory, and multiple things to balance. Most of the interaction is indirect, except for the action selection.

UPDATE: Moving from 7 to 8. The long term planning enabled by seeing the random events all laid out for the year makes deep strategy possible. Very nice.

Enjoyed my first and so far only play of this game.  Having seen and read reviews warning me in advance that losing some of your people is inevitable, I was able to plan around who was most expendable and consequently didn't find it too harsh.  It's been a while since we played it and I'm keen to see it hit the table again soon.

[01/01/10]
Finally got a second play of this, and thoroughly enjoyed it again. It seemed to go down well with everyone so hopefully it'll see more play in the very near future since we're making more of an effort these days to replay games while they're still fresh in our minds. The juggling act of keeping your key resources intact by planning for the upcoming events while still trying to build a VP engine around it, gives it a refreshingly different feel than most of the games we play.

RATING: 6

A lot of digesting the mechanisms of arbitrary people and actions that do arbitrary things to collect arbitrary resources and score arbitrarily, and the pay-off isn't really worth it, because once you get past the "language", you and your opponents can tend to just optimize given the current situation. The game seems to just artificially encourage situations that leave you f***ed, and labels it "tension". Also very dubious about game balance. The double-Privilege early might not be broken, but it's annoying in that everybody should jump on it or him if somebody does it. Scholars are pathetically weak.

More on the artifice of the game: the closing up of random action choices if you choose certain actions is an artificial way to introduce player interaction into a "game" whose soul is really about optimizing against the board, not a whole lot against other players.

The initiative track is cool, but not enough to rescue the game.

Learned this one by playing the online version on silvermask.  This is a crisis mitigation game - a theme that I really like.  I wish there was a little more player interaction as aside from semi-blocking, there really isn't any.  The order of the disasters changes every game so it ensures some good replay-ability and I like that you can't have like combinations of starting court members.  Some cool elements that work really nicely together and make for a solid, fun, game.

The more I play this, the more I love it.  I've only played with 5 players, but it is always a fun game with quite a bit of strategy that you will appreciate the more you play.

My only problem with this game would be that sometimes the winner can be a foregone conclusion when you get to the last couple of rounds.

A friend of mine calls this all rats, all the time (a reference to Notre Dame).  You are constantly struggling just to keep your head above water.  It is more a game about what you are going to be getting rid of, which is a different way of thinking than is usual in games.  Fortunately, you at least get some warning about all of the trouble that is going to be coming your way or the game would be nearly unplayable.  [03/13/2011]

In the Year of the Dragon (Rio Grande) -- Played once; four-player.

RATING: 1
I've borrowed this from our local Feldian, to see if atypical Feld would do something form me. Turns out: mean Feld is still Feld.

It's a MPS game of optimising scarce actions (12 per game + 12 buys). While it seems half of them give you points and half prevent you from losing points (or parts of your VP engine), the difference isn't that big. It's an action selection game, kinda streamlined, kinda fiddly, theme is kinda there and isn't. The only difference between old and new Feld is an emotional illusion of losing points VS getting less point. Mostly it's obvious what you need to do, it's just in the timing.

At the end of day it's only an optimising puzzle. Thing is, our Feldian doesn't like it, and frankly this is so bland, so accountant-y, I'm surprised anybody actually gets excited by it. But they do apparently. Picture me confused.

Down 0.5 a point - because optimisation within a minimal framework is a special circle of hell.

RATING: 7
For [i]In the Year of the Dragon[/i], Feld takes two of his favoured design elements – penalty avoidance and competition for turn order – and dedicates an entire game to them. The result is an unconventional design in a positive sense. Not only is the game an unabashed struggle for turn order, but it also tinkers with players' loss aversion tendencies. 

What appeals to me is how the game requires you to gradually dismantle your hard-earned empire – often for the greater good. Many Euros focus on building and running your engine, but no other game comes close to capturing this design's brutal yet zen-like atmosphere of taking apart components which are no longer useful to you. (A general tip, though, would be to prepare for events two months ahead in advance.)

Having played over 15 games, there is one issue that continues to bug me. Because of the way the various restrictions are set up, there are several points in the game when mathematical logic practically dictates your next move. (Assuming, of course, that you are playing to win.) There is very little room for unconventional maneuvers, and the feeling of constant constraint becomes tiring after a while.

RATING: 7.5
Alea is almost trying to make amends for the sorry Rum and Pirates. Stefan Feld (Alea ‘it’ boy) follows up Notre Dame with this cracker of a ‘gamers game’. Players are trying to draft actions which allow them to build up their kingdom. Different types of people are recruited to help create various things needed to gain VPs or stave off calamities and events at the end of each year (turn).

The game is all about trying to scores VPs while trying to manage the (generally) horrible effects of events. There is constant jockeying for position and money is tight. Mechanics are tightly intervoven so that players are constantly trying to find the best balance between recruiting people and using their benefits. One has to constantly focus on what everyone else is doing. Very intense. Only downside is that the package looks like an advanced prototype more than an actual product…bring back Vohwinkle please.

Reading the rules, this game really appealed to me.  It seemed like Puerto Rico meets Shogun, two games I'm quite fond of.  ...but I own both of those games so I'm unsure of exactly how much this is needed in my collection.  But when an offer for it comes up on Tanga, I really can't be to blame, can I?

After playing, it does have some fun and interesting mechanics.  It also has an "excellent" king-maker mechanic that makes it very hard to overcome mistakes.  It seems you should try at all costs to make sure you never fall too far behind on the person track.

RATING: 8
Action Selection, Management. AKA "In the Year of Getting Kicked in the Nuts for 10 Turns." Solid game. Very, very tight management game in which you must stockpile rice, warriors and money against a series of nasty events such as drought, Mongol invasion and tribute. You can see the full order of the events coming for the game, but it's tough balancing all the things you need and want to do, such as scoring VP rather than preparing for the events. The initiative mechanism is devilish, yet at the end of the game being far ahead on that track is worthless. Looking forward to more plays now that I've experienced it once.

Ended up dumping it because nobody else enjoyed being stomped on by the game engine.

Players interact by taking away each others ressources. Sounds stupid, but turns out to be quite strategic.

As opposed to other euros, "your people" in this game starve to death, succumb to diseases, get enslaved or fall victim to Mongol raids. This is mostly your fault: sometimes you'd rather get a new court lady than remunerate a farmer.

Erős játékról van szó, amiben tényleg többféle stratégia is vezethet győzelemre. A játékosok pagodákat építenek, akár 3 szintűt is, ahova alattvalókat hívnak, akik különböző módokon segíthetik őket, annyi számút egy-egy palota alá, amennyi azok szintje. A 12 hónap során különböző katasztrófák érik a játékosokat, amiket a jó alattvaló választással tudnak kisebb nagyobb nehézségek árán átvészelni. Nagyon jól kitalált a játékossorrendet eldöntő mechanizmus és a 12 hónap történései is. Sajnos csak ketten volt alkalom kipróbálni elsőre. Működött, de egyértelmű, hogy nem két személy esetén jön ki a játék igazi lényege. Mindenképp több fősen ajánlott valószínűleg öten a legjobb.

[2011-05-28]
Érdekes, három fővel nem igazán változott a játékmenet, talán tényleg 4-5 játékossal jön ki igazán a harc az egyes alattvalókért. Nagyon fontos a játékban a játékossorrend, erre nagyon kell figyelni, különben könnyen bajba kerülhet a játékos.

[2012-03-17]
Sikerült öten is kipróbálni. Tényleg így a legjobb és legizgalmasabb. Teljesen különböző stratégiák lehetnek a játékban. Nagyon jó a hónapokban történő katasztrófák véletlen sorrendje is. Teljesen más játékokat hozva minden partinál. Egyre jobban tetszik. Még nem emelek a pontszámon, mert félek van benne olyan, hogy kicsit rossz játékkal teljesen lehetetlen helyzetbe kerülés.

[2012-04-07]
Teljesen kilátástalan helyzetben csak nagyon nehezen tudja sodorni magát a játékos azért, úgyhogy emelek egyet, mert úgy tűnik biztos stratégia sincs, csak maximum erős.

[2012-04-28]
Pontszám visszaesett 7-re nálam, mégis van nyerő stratégia benne. A kiváltságos stratégia egyrészt könnyű, nagyon gondolkodni sincs mit rajta és biztos 100 körüli pontot hoz. Nagyon nehéz megverni mással sajnos.

[2012-05-19]
Az eggyel fentebbi miatt még egyet rontok a pontszámom. Egy biztos stratégia egy játékot sajnos könnyen megöl, így nem tehetem, hogy 7-es jó értékelést adok rá.

[2012-12-08]
Az erős nyerő stratégiával rendelkező játékok 4-esnél, 5-ösnél jobbat nem kaphatnak sajnos. 6->5

It is a solid action drafting game (players chose one at a time from the available actions). The problem is that I'm on the verge of saturation when it comes to action drafting.  After El Grande came out, everyone was trying to use its Area Control system.  Now that Area Control is played out everyone has looked back to El Grande for more things to take, with Caylus it was action drafting.  Because Caylus was so successful, it seems that everyone is using it now. Agricola is heavily steeped in it, but it also is running on the other hot design mechanic the Engine System.  With In the Year of the Dragon, it is all drafting and action drafting.  It works well, and because the game beats you up so much it is engaging, but come on, can we give action drafting a rest.

About the game itself, well, it is annoying that at a certain point in the game (halfway?) some players will be well aware that there will be no way for them to win.  I don't mind it in some games, but here this game is all about point accumulation.  It is so abstract that I can't just focus on some element of your game for fun and just hope to place as best as I can.  Certainly experience will yield the best success, but that makes me wonder how balanced it is...

I don't know, its fine.  What isn't fine is the graphic design of the board.  I'm not sure why there even is a board.  I guess it is supposed to be a carpet?  If just looks like someone printed out orange on a sheet of paper only to discover it isn't water resistant ink when they spilled their Mountain Dew on it.  It looks like it was produced straight from the prototype.  Ugly and uninspired.  I wish they would have put a beautiful Chinese landscape on it.  Maybe, have the scoreboard be the Great Wall?  Perhaps the whole thing as a top view of the Forbidden City? Blech.

The first few turns are essential to get right to prepare for the challenges ahead. If you make a mistake here it can ruin your changes of being competitive in the game (it is a problem for new players when playing with experienced players). It seems hard to find time to earn more VP than the other guys, let alone make sure you don't lose too many persons and fall behind.

RATING: 8.5
This game is really good, but I just didn't get into it that much when I played it.  It's a pretty game with a nice theme.  There are some really cool mechanics in this one: like how the pieces that give you the most benefit put you in behind in turn order, and certain pieces give you points every turn, so it has some potential.  Maybe it's the learning curve that turned me off some.
         
UPDATE:  I'd say that it's kinda fun, but I still can't move it up to a 7.  I still have trouble identifying all of the characters.  It does have some good tension and interesting decisions, but for whatever reason, it just doesn't do it for me.  I think that it's because you're constantly losing your people, and rather than enjoying the tightness of it, I find it to be frustrating.

UPDATE #2: Getting a bit better sense of the strategy here and bumping this one back up to a 7.  Might even move up more with more plays.

UPDATE #3: Continuing to move up as now I've got the gameplay down and can really identify what I'm doing.  You really just need to plan well and cycle through your people at the right times.  A solid 8 and worth giving a couple of tries before giving up on.

I came to this one undecided about Feld. There was a lot of hype about him, and I liked Roma, but while The Castles of Burgundy left me with a decent impression, I didn't love it, and I disliked Notre Dame. ItYotD solidified my opinion of Feld's style: boring, cliched themes sustained by unique mechanics--like Knizia's games--but without much elegance or interaction. ItYotD has a lot more of both than Notre Dame, and I don't mind playing, but I don't get excited about it.

While there wasn't anything wrong with the game, it was dull.  I didn't feel like I had any new experiences with the game, as we've seen most of this before.  It was mainly a game of damage control - how to block or deal with pain, and I really don't enjoy that type of pounding-on-your-head game.

RATING: 7
Interesting Game.

Pros:
* interesting mechanic of determining the start player each round - a separate 'person score' that is increased when choosing tiles, so there is a constant tension between the tile and the next round position.
* Many ways to score points - women tiles, privileges, events (dragon festival), monk tiles.
* Tight in the sense that each player has exactly the same cards for the whole game, so require planning.
* Accessible to the girls (no english in game).

Cons:
* Quite fiddly, lots of rules. Actually the rules for the events are quite arbitrary - some give bonus points, some punish by taking stuff away. Hard to remember, require constant reference to the board.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An interesting game that I would expect to like more than I actually did. It's a resource management game: you get 2 turns to build up some resources, then in every following turn you can try adding to your resources, but must face some event that will usually take some of those resources away. These disasters are set up (and public) at the beginning, so you know the order in which they will occur, giving you some idea of which resources you should go after, in which order. Still, there seems to be room for different strategies to get VP while minimizing your losses. Unfortunately, our first game just wasn't all that much [i]fun[/i]. I like the ideas here, but you don't go into the game expecting to kill your people off willy nilly. You expect to play every person in your hand and end the game with a huge court! At least, I was hoping to -- most efficiency games allow you to keep most of what you play. Of course, that isn't the case here. I'd guess that if you really KNEW that up front, it would feel better; but it just didn't feel good trying to optimize things and still lose stuff! I also like the person track. Given the way the action selection works and how tight money is, turn order manipulation is VERY important.

I instantly loved this game.  It's one of those excellent designs that features simple rules yet intriguing choices.  It reminds me the most of Maharaja because you have to look at what's coming up in the next round or two, although here it's usually to avoid pain.  Having a second track for player order is a great addition and makes every decision even more interesting.  I can easily see it moving up to a nine after playing again.  Update:  moving on up!

RATING: 8
I quite like this game, there's nothing else in my collection like it.  The gameplay is simple enough to teach quickly, almost anybody can pick it up, and some of the mechanics are quite original.  I especially like the person track that determines play order and the balance between younger and older person tiles and how it relates to moving along the person track.

This is almost a game just of damage control.  The game will kick your butt from beginning to end, there is no way to completely mitigate all the negative events.  And even if you could then you wouldn't be scoring points...which of course is how you win the game.  Every round is tense as you try to balance number of palaces, 9 different person tiles, money, position on the person track, mitigating events, and scoring points.  You can also play this game a different way every time and still win.  The components are also stylish and attractive and the theme is pretty persistent and interesting.

I like the tension and brutality of this game because it is never just one player who is the victim of it but unfortunately that is exactly what might keep this game from hitting the table as often as I'd like.  Not everyone likes to be beat up by their games, whether they have company or not.

It isn't better than Notre Dame. In fact I think I don't like this game at all but I have to play it again just to make sure.
I felt that the game was playing me and not the opposite. Everything seems to be about damage control.

After playing it a couple of times more I started to like it. I still have the "damage control" feeling but I guess it's something that we can turn to us during the game.

This is a very interesting, well-made, tension-filled, medium complexity game with multiple paths to victory that is not my style.  Learning the rules of the game is not too big a challenge, but learning HOW to play it is.  The mechanics of the game are well designed, and the production value is fairly average.  Unfortunately the fun factor just isn't there for me (and it's NOT just the lack of theme - there are plenty of fairly abstract games that I enjoy).  This is one of those games that just kicks your ass and leaves you feeling like you are continuously on the edge of disaster.  I can see how some would relish the challenge and would find the tension quite exciting.  Myself, I would rather play a game in which I feel like I am progressing and accomplishing something, rather than simply minimizing losses.  So not a bad game, just not for me.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

Surprised I hadn't left a comment for this one already. Older Feld game most notable for its disaster track: at the end of each round, players can be punished by various afflictions (e.g. a plague that wipes out part of the population if healers are not present, a famine that does the same without rice, an emperor who does the same without tribute). There is also a fireworks event, resulting in victory points instead of death.

Part of the game's charm is in how differently it plays out with different disaster ordering -- for example, if two plagues are in quick succession then it is safe to let healers subsequently die as their services are no longer required. There's quite a bit of point-salad to it, with several different types of both in-game and end-game scoring.

Most people I play with are big fans but I don't understand the appeal. Part of that is a personal bias against unthematic spreadsheet games with no spatial element. But my biggest qualm is the mechanism where actions each turn are randomly divided into groups; the first player to visit a group gets their action free and those subsequent must pay. This drives pleasantly strong jockeying for turn order, which also informs the choice of citizens -- those that provide more in-game benefit do less for turn order. The issue is that the randomness of the groups has a very strong impact on later players, particularly the second in turn, who may or may not also get their favoured choices for free. Money is so tight that this is no small bonus.

Every game is a pleasure.

I do not understand the fuss around this game. Yes, it's working well, there is a lot of interaction, a lot of decisions to do when other players selected the action you needed, but it is flat. A lot of optimization in a way that doesn't appeal to me - I like to outwit opponents, here I'm forced to mimic their strategies. Ugly look, no addicitve effect on me.
[Edit]I raised the rating a bit -- I want to win with this game :) I still don't like it, but I'd like to test some strategies.

Played twice.  I like it.  It seems to be missing something for me, as others are gushing over it.  It has some good ideas, a reasonable play time, and some brutally interesting choices.  The strategic and tactical choices really are very impressive, and long term planning is needed to do well.

I should like this game more than I do.  I think I found it counter-intuitive, as I thought that the game was about surviving more than it is.  I'm looking forward to more plays.

Update:  Played with four and it finally clicked.  This is an excellent game.  I had reasons.  I don't remember them.

This game looked a lot more complicated than it turned out to be. After the first couple rounds I understood enough of what was going on to play through the rest of the game without feeling lost. (I have to respond to this after further play. I "got" the game quickly, but now I have seen reasonably good gamers who are totally lost throughout the entire game. So it might not be as easy to pick up as I thought.)

I first gave this an 8 because I really enjoyed it, but decided that was probably a bit hasty after just one play, so I changed that to a 7. After my second play, a little of the shine has worn off, but it's still a great game. I'm sticking with the 7.

I've translated rules to Italian.... Hard management game. It's impossible not to lose anyone during the year of the dragon. Maybe not as good as Notredame but I'll tell you after some more games. Must own. Raised from 9.2 -> 9.5 The different event position through the year are the greatest way to have different games every time

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Really hard for me to decide how to rate this game after one play.  I *think* it was in the good but not great range.  But definately felt like it could go either way.  If I knew the strategy better maybe I would like it less or more.  I guess it did leave me wanting to play it more and learn it better, which is a good feeling to have after trying a new game.

RATING: 7
[RGG 'In the Year of the Dragon' 2007 edition] {China; action-draft, variable-player-order, resource management; optimal 5p} YoD is a solid euro game.  In the core, it's a traditional Euro game - calculation, calculation and calculation.  However, it adds some refreshment to traditional euro game - your VP engine is subject to brutal destruction.

It is a gamer's game - abstract and full of calculation.  The theme is thin (does not couple with the mechanics well).  It is a tense resource management game. Players usually would like to do more than 1 thing in a turn.  However, the game is not highly vulnerable to analysis paralysis and a game turn can usually be completed within 5-7 minutes.  The game is clearly well tested and nicely balanced.  Luck is very low (nearly open information); however, the strategy is pre-set at early games and players can hardly change their strategy during the game; thus it is not a reactive game.  Replayability is good for the random event track and random grouping of action cards.  It's unforgiving - early mistakes can make one have no chance of winning.  Player interaction is moderate - no direct confrontation but the competition on initiation track, actions, and person tiles are strong.

The rule is not complex and can easily be understood.  However, there is a learning curve here.  I think players need 4-10 games to explore all potential scoring methods and counter methods.

There are a few minuses of YoD that make it an only good game, not a great one.  First, the theme is tenuous.  Mechanics are important but a great game should be one with nicely coupled mechanics and theme.  Next, it lacks some strong excitement.  It is fun for gamers who enjoy winning with a better strategy.  If players are experienced with all scoring and countering methods.  They only random factor is the grouping of action cards - which is the only way to add excitement.  And there is no way of planning an intrigue to ambush / grab a large amount of score due to the nearly open-information nature.  There are no surprises (in mid / late game).  Finally, the loser-losing-more problem is very acute and it usually happens.  It is very discouraging if players know that they have no chance of winning in mid-game.  This is not a good sign.

In all, it is a solid and fun game for a group of experienced gamers, who know the game well.

This was a surprise, in that I had been totally prepared to love this game. But I didn't; this felt just sort of "Meh" for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. There were some very interesting aspects, like the person track, but I just didn't quite feel like it was as terribly interesting as I had expected. I only played with 3 people, though, and I can see how this is a much more tight, cut-throat game with 4-5. I'd be willing to give it another shot with more players, but as it is it didn't do anything for me.

A game of risk management, damage limitation, and investing for the future. A delicate balance between gaining VP and protecting yourself from calamity. The turn order mechanism seems particularly cute - there's normally a trade-off when hiring people: low ability (but contributing significantly to your turn-order position) or higher ability (but contributing much less to turn order).

RATING: 8
The game does offer many viable paths to victory; however, it seems that one or two paths (depending on the event track) are far, far superior to others and really determine the game in the first 3 or 4 turns. I wish the game was less "harsh" and did not have so many compounding bonuses that are insanely good to get at the start and near useless at the end. Overall it was a fun game and reminded me of Caylus with the different paths to victory. 

Suggestions for improving the game: Reduce starting money from 6 to 5 to prevent a rush for 2-victory point a turn "Privileges." Also, Geishas (Ladies) needs a higher "People" value (from 1 to 3?) or something else, they are very weak and rarely do much in a game compared to other early game choices. Another idea would be to reduce the cost of paying the Emperor Tribute by 1 for each Lady, which could balance her compared to everyone else.

House Rule: Possibly Geishas (Court Ladies) reduce the cost you have to pay to the Emperor by 1 for each one you have. Seems to make them much more useful and balanced compared to all the other pieces.

EDIT: Slightly lower in score as the game can be kingmakery if people are not experienced players. Such as overly valuing things like fireworks. Also, there is a bit of randomness that can completely screw someone over in some elements.

EDIT 2: Again, lowered slightly due to the problem with lack of people keeping others in check. Also, at the highest level it seems to come down just to action layout. Need to try with the expansions to see if they make the game better.

Superior worker placement game. It's very simple to understand and quick to learn but still provides a good deal of strategy. What I find most appealing about the game is balancing the decision of becoming the first player to make moves, which obviously provides you with more choices making the game easier (although there's perhaps a bit too much emphasis on this aspect of the gameplay - if you're continually picking last you aren't going to win), or going for victory points. There are negative consequences from making poor decisions, which is a feature I know some people don't like about many games of this type. The production values are pretty standard Euro-fare (nothing to get too excited about), although I do like the Chinese-themed artwork, which complements the game's theme very well.

One play: Superb.  Not so much crisis management as lots of tough choices and angst.  It's really a building game as you add a person to your team each turn and you add ways to get resources or vp.  Occasionally you loose a person but you just have to plan when and where you are willing to loose a person and try to loose one that has already fulfilled his duty.  Lots of ways to approach the system.  In our first game, three totally different approaches to the game resulted in 2 points separating 1st and 3rd.  Shows promise. 2008/03/23
Five events:
Fireworks: good - no one looses; some gain vp
Mongols: okay - one person looses one person; some gain vp
Tribute: okay - the worst that should happen is you pass your action and get 3 gold when you need 4 - loose one person.
Disease and Drought: both could be bad but you can see them coming and if you get a double healer you only loose one and if you get nailed by the lack of rice, it's only because you didn't plan and got screwed by the other players.

A largely forgettable Euro. You're playing role cards and collecting people to place into palaces but it was largely forgettable.

The random card layout is a clever idea, but our game, the money production was so highly contested that, with half the game still to go, 2 players were out of the game as they couldn't generate funds and so couldn't pay to displace anyone and so could never catch up with anyone who got to go before them. That seems massively flawed to me.

Finally got this one to the table after several attempts.  This is a game of pure disaster management where your turn is spent trying to prepare for the multitude of disasters and you simply have to choose which ones to let hit you hard and which to try to avoid.

My favourite Essen game. Plays in a reasonable time (less than 90 min), always though choices, good indirect interaction with other players, you can plan your moves ahead, but you may need to change your plans on the way.

I love this game. It's perfect.

Agonizing decisions every round. Nothing is easy. Very difficult to decide what to do since all options give you something, but you miss something else equally important. You never get everything you need. Information is there on the board, you know what is coming, but you can't prepare for every catastrophe, since focusing on one doesn't give you enough time to prepare yourself for another. Minimize your losses. Despite how it sounds, playing can be very satisfactory.

Event tiles are shuffled and randomly placed at set up. That means replayability, as you don't need same things in same order as before.

You don't know what turn angst is before you have played this game. :)

Now played a 3-way and a 4-way game. Fixed a couple mixups with the rules. Still going strong, real candidate for a 10 in my books.

Second 4-player game got my rate up to full ten. It's just a great game - can be taught in 15 mins and played in an hour with newbies. And they can still have a chance. (08)

After about a dozen games the rating goes down to 9, but only because other games are "hotter" now. Still I'm definitely always willing to play. One of my favorites. (13 Feb 09)

Perhaps my favorite Feld! -- and that's saying something for me. The heavy point salad is missing (even if there are echoes of it hiding in some places). If anything, this rather abstract game feels true to Feld's aesthetic. It's about generating lots of points, but it wears this trait on its sleeve, and doesn't hide behind any chrome.

Also helping is the constantly changing landscape of disasters that you must deal with in order to avoid penalties. These disasters drive the play experience and lend the game a certain dynamism that is frustrating in a very enjoyable way. At the same time, you want to figure out a way to generate points round after round in a reliable way, or save up for a large cache of points in the end-game scoring. With so many moving parts, it's easy to see how Feld transitioned into designs like Trajan and Bora Bora, but here the insanity is held in check by a theme (abstract as it is) that is consistent throughout.

At its heart, Dragon is an action selection/card game that lacks any sense of positional play. For whatever reason, that lack of place combined with the round-to-round scoring mechanisms, made the first few turns feel very opaque. The good news is that this feeling of being lost subsided as the point system gelled in my mind by about round three or four. It's a game that you have to play at least twice to fully understand, but the first time will still be enjoyable thanks to the disaster track, which provides easy to understand goals.

RATING: 8
I really like this game.  Yes, it feels brutal, as there are so many things you need, and yet you can only get one thing per turn.  But it's the good kind of brutal.  The order of the events are known to everyone, which aids in planning.  However, other players need the same thing as you at those known times, so there can be a lot of fighting over the same resources.  I love the tension involved as players build up, lose workers, slide by disasters at the last second, and so on.  Another great Alea game.

Disaster management. It's a euro with a bit of a twist. In the Year of the Dragon takes some of the punitive elements from Feld's other games (that is usually an element you have to juggle along with production) and magnifies it. And I love how it functions. Survival becomes as equally important as engine building. I also love working out what disasters you should simply ignore, tempted by points or the threat of an even bigger, looming disaster. Plan, manage, try to stay a float and even thrive. Great game.

Solid offering from Alea, but probably not one that reaches the elite heights of some others in this publisher's outstanding line of games. Everything works and the game seems pretty balanced, but I often feel like my options are very limited/constrained in this one, and that there just isn't enough going on to hold my attention. It's also a title that doesn't exactly scream fun, as players simply seek to stave off disaster round after round.

It's a "make the best of a bad situation" type of game.  It could sorely use some more player interaction.

I'd like to see how it plays with more than two players as things will be most likely even more scarce then. Fireworks didn't play a significant role and neither of us ever used the militia action. This kind of luxury is something that probably wouldn't occur too often in a 5-player session.

This is not your game if you want to build the machinery of a functioning economic engine, but if you like games where instead you have to defend yourself against the games mechanisms to make your (gamer's) life miserable, this is exactly what you are looking for. Personally I enjoy these anticlimatical ecomomic engine games. I also like how it scales between tactical decisions you'll have to take at short term notice as compared to the strategy you have seen for due to the event cards that are in play. Overall, I slightly prefer Macao over this. That being said, it's still a really good game.

I like the theme and driving principle of forever fending off the next crisis but the squeeze is so very tight that a lot of the time I feel I'm making no real decisions because my best course of action is dictated to me by the next event.  An interesting mental exercise but I'm not sure I'd call it 'fun'.

Excellent game with plenty of paths to victory.  Each action presents many choices, all of which seem to have their pluses and minuses.  One of a slew of recent games (along with Notre Dame, Agricola & Galaxy Trucker) in which you must keep one eye on scoring points and the other on just surviving.

Alea expansion adds a nice touch with the Super Event, which gives yet another wrinkle to the event order (which already gives a lot of replayability to the game).  The Great Wall seems to add a safety-valve and make play a little "looser", which is probably necessary when the Super Event is negative, but I'm not sure I like it when the Super Event is neutral or positive.

This is just the kind of game I really love and would play over and over again.

There's something about ordering the operations in a limited decision space that I really like, then mix in how the turn order track really serves to destroy your plans and you have a great game.

It's a little bone dry though and reprint did nothing to change the slightly dated art work, so it isn't an easy sell for players.

This did the rounds at my gaming group last year. It took me a while to get the hang of it and to figure out that stopping the disasters was not the sole aim of the game. Infact, killing your workers can be a winning startegy when executed correctly. The method of determining turn order is clever and can a real impact on the end result. A word of warning though- this game is definitely not suitable for novice gamers.

This is a nifty game.  Pseudo-auction with a pseudo-role selection similar to "Mission Red Planet" except it's not really an auction and not really role selection.  It's gonna be a bad year, and you know exactly how and when, but even so you're screwed.  Being last in "people points", and yes that's what they are called, is bad.  But then again, being last in any occupation is usually bad too.  I wish I could get more plays of this in.

RATING: 8
[thing=31594][/thing] was one game I wanted to play for quite a long time - but its OOP status lasted for several years and simply no one I play with had it. Until one did. And now I have opinions.

[thing=31594][/thing] is a work placement game from Stefan Feld, before he started his thing on colored dice and giving points for everything. In here you still gain points 16 times or more times during play and one extra final scoring, so there is no shortage of points, as this is Feld, after all, but one meaner and wanting to kill some folk and destroy houses.

The complexity of [thing=31594][/thing] doesn't come from mix of mini games or bucket of rules, is placed, instead, in the most proper place: in the decision-making process: there are 8 months with problems (diseases, famine, taxes or attacks), two with extra scoring (the festivities), and you players simply won't be able to prepare for everything. Choices will have to be made, compromises accepted and dealt with. Workers will die/leave/slaved, maybe you will lose floors on your houses, and points will go to others and you will just be able to look and think "ah, I wish it was me".

Playing time, surprisingly, is much more manageable and lean than the informed 75-100 minutes - we normally don't pass the 75 mark with 4, and stay around 60 with 3. Maybe with 5 players taking their time, sure, is possible, and is best to shoot above than bellow in this matter. Still, is important to mention that the pacing is fast, as though there are multiple decisions each turn, they are often done quick.

While I don't like everything Feld has done (Arena: Rome is neat, but too agressive for my taste; and Oracle of Delphi was disappointing; etc), I do enjoy most of them, considering some brilliant games (Macao, Strasbourg, Notre Dame, etc), and [thing=31594][/thing] is up there with the best: smart, tense, with interaction (denial, non-destructive), though decisions all around, punitive, yes, but giving points in all turns, to make players feel better, lively pace with small downtime - put all of this together and, sir, you got yourself a classic. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Torn. I like the game, especially in theory. It plays fast and is rather simple. It has interesting drafting and you care somewhat what other players are doing. But on the other side it feels a little "loose" and unpolished, and the theme is slightly odd.

On a turn you first draft to take one of seven actions. The actions are divided randomly into a number of groups equal to the number of players, so it's like you have one fat worker who blocks other actions besides the one he's taking. Afterwards you draft specialists from a limited supply, using limited cards (i.e. you may run out of opportunities to draft a given type) and often can choose between a better specialist, or a worse one who will improve your turn priority.

Thematically I most dislike that three of the nine specialists just give you VP, and there's also an action that does this as well. So, four thematically and mechanically distinct things that just give VP. That reeks of a spreadsheet game.

The main theme is that there are twelve months, i.e. twelve turns, in each of which there will be some disaster or event that players can see coming and prepare for. While it is only slightly odd that players should be able to foresee when disasters will strike, there are some distracting side effects of this. The most obvious case is food. Drought will strike twice, and this is the only time you need food. If the droughts are over, or if you've accumulated enough food to survive them, you can safely get rid of your farmer specialists and never take the food action again.

(There are similar but lesser issues with the other events: The festivals' effect on the need for fireworks specialists (lesser issue because the amount you need depends on what others have); plague's effect on the need for healers (lesser issue because you need to have the healers at the time of the plague, and there is no draftable action associated with healers); and "tribute" with money (lesser issue because money has another important use). The last event is Mongol invasion, after which you don't need to keep your warriors around, though they can also be used to improve your turn order.)

The Mongol invasions provoke an arms race reminiscent of the same thing in 7 Wonders (or the Speicherstadt with its firemen), except that the number of military specialists is limited to the point that by the time the second Mongol invasion is coming around, there may be nothing left to draft, so you can only shrug and accept whatever the foregone conclusion is.

Ultimately it's a pretty good game (fast and with not a lot of superfluous junk) but noticeably weird and flawed.

...I'm surprised there are people that have a problem with this game knocking down their sandcastles... I thought it was rather mild compared to Pax Porfiriana or even Peloponnes. Maybe with more players it's a bigger issue? I played with three but suspect it's better with more.

...I'm excited about the [i]type[/i] of euro that this is: No spatial element, no deluge of special powers or tiles, and it doesn't feel like MPS. Need more like this.

...Played again with 4 players and also the Great Wall expansion. One player bought a large privilege right away, which contributed to faring very poorly with the events. They managed to maintain a lead for quite awhile, even when completely obliterated, but ultimately placed last, having no people. So, now I understand how one could find the game too harsh. It has euro-style player elimination.

That said, I definitely enjoy playing the game and am upping the score a bit and putting it on my top ten.

...Another thing I like about the game is how it tends to promote diversity of player positions.

Some interesting decision to be made regarding the recruitment of people which can affect player order and how one deals with the bad events that happened. Trade-off may need to be made when the palace are fully occupied and player have to decide which character to remove from the palace. 

However, the privilege action which is not tied to any character may cause the game to be out of balance as the player purchasing it early may run away with the game.

I appreciate the design enough. There's something perversely fun about scrunching yourself down into a blender and watching someone hit the 'dice' button.

I do like the tension of mitigating bad and worse, like Twilight Struggle. Somehow I appreciated the games idea more than I want to re-play it. Perhaps I prefer those moments to oscillate more rather than jitter the whole game under the bar, because it feels like it's the game punishing me rather than my opponents.

Might make the 2 player version better.

Alea Big Box #12. One of my very favorite games, so many decisions confounded by so many goals and interrelated events occurring within limited time frames. The game is full of "what I should have done on my last turn."  Many different strategies work, and deciding what to do often depends on what others are doing, so watching everybody else carefully is key.  Preparing for the annual event and for the time track are both important but other decisions are even more necessary (like preparing for the final BIG scoring!) I will play this any time. (Purchased real metal asian coin for this game!!)

layers take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000. The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.

The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of "person" cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.

Careful planning is the key to surviving "the year of the dragon," but survival alone may not win you the game.

Rating based on 1 3-player game.  My gaming group loves this game and can't stop talking about it.  My take on the game - Eh Whatever?!  Throughout the game, I couldn't stop trying to figure out why I didn't like this game as much as my gaming group.  Just can't put my finger on what it is. Just wasn't that fun.  I can think of a bunch of other games I would rather play.As far as I could tell, contrary to my gaming groups belief, there is somewhat of a run away leader problem with this game.  I don't think I made any really huge mistakes but I just didn't do enough to catch the leader.  Found that in order to catch the turn leader I would have needed to sacrifice too much.  I guess that is the appeal of this game to so many - DAMNED IF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T. and I was DAMNED because I didn't.  

As a caveat, I did finish last.  That was to be expected, but that didn't affect my rating.  I was pretty close to the other two in points until the end of the game and then I was blown away.  That wasn't a factor in my rating.  Will give this game one more shot before deciding not to play again.

I've never prayed for famine so hard in all my life!  Feld has you delighting in the most horrendous of catatrophes, all wrapped up in an essentially economic engine that leaves no room for fat.  [i]Drachen[/i] is all about maximising efficiency.  But with a gorgeous board & components, a calamitous theme, and more [i]schadenfreude[/i] than should ever be allowed, it feels as far from economics as you can get.

After two plays, I'd say it's pretty good. Normally I don't care for games where you start off in low-grade panic mode because bad things will start happening to you (as opposed to positive development games), but here the disasters are predictable and universal, so interesting to deal with in game turns. In addition, it's not clear you have to deal with them as such - I pursued a strategy of building up and not losing anything to disasters, and won, but in the first game by only 2-3 points over two players who did short-term points-grabbing building and let the disasters kill off their old stuff.

Got my first play of this game in 2010, because I really didn't like the way it looked when I saw it at the Essen 2007 fair. I then realised that I almost missed out on the best Alea experience since Puerto Rico. It really is that good! There aren't many games out there that deal out more pain to the players than this game does - it feels like you are mostly doing damage control from start to finish. Still, the game went down very well with all of us (5 players) and I can't wait to play again.
UPDATE: Playing this game with just two players is fine, but more players definitely make it better!

This is a different game for me. I like it because I felt the mechanisms were rather unique. I have never played a game where pain and anguish is the central theme. It is enjoyable in a painful and sadistic sort of way. After one play with 2 players, I can understand why gamers either love it or hate it. For me, this mechanism of weathering the brutal difficulties is quite neat. It is basically a war of attrition. Thumbs up

After another play, this game is good with 2! This is a really excellent design by Feld. The only concern I have is the negative theme.

After my strong impression of Castles of Burgundy, I had high expectations for Stefan Feld's games, but I still managed to be amazed when I played In the Year of the Dragon. I really enjoy the great planning and strategy required to avert disaster, while still scoring decently. Just a fantastic game, and quite possibly my favorite. 

Edit: After several more face to face games and 13 games on Board Game Arena, I can confidently say that this is a fantastic game. I have seen an extreme variety of winning strategies- high initiative strategy with lots of helmets, craftsman strategy, tax collector and privilege strategy, scholar strategy, and even a very successful court lady strategy.  The only drawback is that it is not a good two-player game at all because the initiative track is too important. However, it is still quite good with 3 players, and is phenomenal with 4 or 5.

Just forget this game even has a 2-player version, and it's awesome. I kept playing 2 player on Board Game Arena because I so badly want it not to be broken, but I haven't figured out a way to beat an initiative strategy that revolves around helmets, so the game is decided based on who picks tiles first. The second player may have a chance if they get lucky enough with the remaining action choices being ones they want to perform, but in my opinion, this causes the game to lose its charm, since one of my favorite parts of the game are the widely varied paths to victory. I can't recommend it enough with more players, though.

I really like games where the game itself just tries to beat you down.  This game certainly has the doom and gloom approach that I like.  I've played several times, and come to the conclusion that the flow of the game is very group dependent, especially when it comes to the person track.  I've won a a runaway victory by hanging back with one group, but then I've also gotten killed by trying the same thing with another.  The strategy is remarkably fluid.  I like the emphasis on mid-range strategy to try to set yourself up to mitigate calamities three or four steps down the road.  The person track also keeps you thinking every game.  You can really be hurt if you hang back too much and allow yourself to be vulnerable to other players.

Another great game, totally different in feel. Best described as trying to plug 10 different holes in a dike with only your four (five? laugh ) extremities.

Alas, not a hit with the wife, who dislikes the negative "tear everything down you've built" aspect.

(After 2 2p games and 2 4p games and 2 5p games)  Lot of options, but your optimal actions are determined by planning for the events.  Kind of like preparing or 10 months of "rats" in Notre Dame.  Not everyone will live - it seems a bit brutal.  Like the turn order/population track.   2p games had one person kind of running away with it and the 4p games were a bit more tense. With 5 players the population track became even more important and cash was tight.  Would play with 5 again if everyone has played before - otherwise it seems a little unfair to the newbie.  I feel it takes one game to "get" all that is in the game flow.  Really like this game.

Rated after seven games, there certainly is something in this game. The goal to survive and knowing that you can't have everything creates a nice panic atmosphere. The mechanics of the game work excellent, the components are ok and the overall feeling is great.

I just need to play this more, rules and tactics are forgotten if this game is played once every second year or so, it needs to be played at least twice a year. Probably even more, because I have rated it as 9. The rating might drop to 8 if I can't play this regularly, but I aim to play this game and keep this rating so far.

So far three games during this year, and the rating is going to stay - great game.

First game of 2014 and I dropped the rating to 8. It just don't feel so agonizing as it used to be, it might also be related to number of players (3), but I don't know. This is not a game for everyone, that's for sure and this is also a different to other Feld games - for better. ;)

Updated after the ninth play, again with three. The game was tight, I lost, but the aforementioned lack of agony was still there. I'm very close to drop the rating to 7 and sell the game...

Tenth play was with four players. This felt good again (I won, but that was not the point), I think I won't play this with three in the future. Let's keep the 8.

First play - 5 players. 4 of us were new players. I got off to a slow start and was a little iffy on a few of the more fiddly rules but I still managed to put together a half-decent strategy. I never built another temple. I finsihed with 2 3-level temples and I still managed to stay with 5 points of the 1st and second place players. The lone experienced player among us won by 1 point. Getting the double dragon marker early in the game seemed to help. I'm looking forward to my next game now that I've got a play under my belt. Second try - I finished with the temples I started with! I never built onto them. I finsihed in second (barely) in a 5 player game with 2 newbs. First place was way out in front of me. * 8/21/08 I've got 3 more plays under my belt. The last one I won with 102 pts, just 2 ahead of osiris ra. I'm liking the game more now and raising it to a 9.

RATING: 5
Am I missing something?  This is a fine design, but it doesn't seem all that inspired, or even all that interesting.  The choices to make each turn are challenging enough, but based on the events coming up in the year, it seems like there's one optimal move each turn.  I can see the different possible strategies available to players, but it's just not the second coming of gaming that everyone claims it to be.  Am I missing some sort of depth, or is this another one of those "Play Ten Times" sort of game, where you have to play it a bunch before its secret is revealed?  I mean, I'd play it again, but I'm not going to be burning to do so.

Plays fairly quickly with a nice balance of interaction and puzzling bootstrapping; however, it is overwhelmingly a game of risk management, and it is quite easy to put yourself into a whole from which you will not recover. Best played with others of similar expertise, or in a "friendly" where those with less expertise are given help and advice commensurate with their needs (unless everyone in your group subscribes to the "learn to avoid getting hit in the head" school of game-mastery).

Players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000. The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.
\13\\13\
The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of "person" cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.
\13\\13\
Careful planning is the key to surviving "the year of the dragon," but survival alone may not win you the game.

A strategic game where you're trying to keep your people alive through the tribulations of the year. Every month you must meet a certain challenge. There is a prestige track that determines who gets the first action, and the person with the most points wins.

I gave up on this a long while back, but am revisiting as I think I was premature.  Glad I have, as it's pretty cool. Definitely think the Great Wall is a good expansion, helps replay and opens up the game just a little, with minimal fuss (though the printing gaffe is annoying).

Feld's alea work is all quite good, though it all (well, not R&P) feels like branches off of some ur-game.  Much like Knizia, he reuses bits and pieces and finds a way to make it (reasonably) fresh.

A totally underrated crisis management game and one of the most unique euros I've ever played. Maximum depth, minimum rules. Every decision made in this game is critical and deliciously agonizing. You have to plan your actions very carefully and really stick to a long-term strategy. One mistake made early on in the game might have dramatic consequences.

Gotta say that this game gets better and better with every subsequent play, especially when you play with skilled, demanding opponents (I emphasise the plural here - you need at least 3 players, this game just isn't nearly as interesting when played only with 2). Try it out if you like strategy-heavy games like Caylus.

Just remember to play with the official anniversary edition rules change: large privilege now costs 7 juan instead of 6! This really balances out the opening moves.

Been watching for awhile - I've already posted my initial component thoughts as a review.  Will probably collect thoughts on the gameplay here until I have enough for a review.

Feels like an engine building game,  but with the constant events,  it's more a juggling game, since you have to keep switching parts of your engine to keep up with events.

Interaction can feel indirect,  but blocking the "essential" actions of those without money is pretty nasty.

No luck means that it's a pretty unforgiving design.   Miscalculations can be pretty costly,  since there's reset - good investments pay off a lot, and mistakes compound.

Remembering what all the events do is a bit tough - would have been nice to have this information on the tiles themselves.

A little effort to setup/take down - need to sort all the different types of people into their stacks.  18,  which isn't as many as the Puerto Rico buildings,  and the upside is there's different colour tiles and didfferent pictures for all of them.

It's a bit of a cold-hearted game,  last month's heroes are often this month's cannon fodder.  Then again,  there's hilarious bits of narrative as people toss out the pious monks in favour of glittery dancing girls.

Usability:  Add a spot on the board for the "refill money action".   Hints/Icons on the action tiles of what the event is about.   Icons on the younger tiles matching the bottom row (and reminder that you only take these to start).

I have had one game with a "fallaway trailer" issue.  Most games I've played have been pretty close to the end between the leaders,  but it is definitely very possible to fall behind,  especially if you have no money.

Wow...seems like it's really easy to play this one wrong.  Looks like you *do* have to lose people during drought from specific pagodas,  not amortised food loss.

RATING: 5
The processional nature of the game didn't grab me - I enjoy an arc to a game and while there is turn by turn changes in the events there isn't a story arc in which the beginning, middle and end of the game feel markedly different. There are some interesting decisions around ensuring you have the people and the palaces in balance, but it's too mechanical. Many people seem to enjoy the crushing nature of the game where you're trying to avert disaster, but I haven't found it to be all that difficult to do this with some forward planning. I do really like the scoring system where you earn little bits of points each round that add up over time and where the idea is to maintain a one or two point advantage over a period or else develop a plan to make up gaps with other areas such as people still in your palaces at game end.

I started to rate this a perfect 10, but decided to start at 9 since we've only played it once.  And it's quite unique in that it's an amalgam of mechanics - it's a civilization building game, but fits in crisis management, turn management, resource management, and varied short-term goals, where you have to find some balance to score well.  Because the timing of the goals are random, there is no single strategy that will always win.  The randomly-timed goals also eliminate repetition that often accompanies games, because in one turn you'll need to acquire fireworks, but in another you'll need to accumulate enough wealth to pay the tax man.  Plus, as someone else pointed out, there's a body count!  It's quite good, maybe perfect.

You need to look ahead 1 or 2 turns to plan on how to offset the disasters coming. With that in mind, you must pay attention to turn order, which can change or not each turn.

Played twice (with 4 and 5 players). A very promising game from Essen 2007. It has interesting decisions and lots of "I wish I could do several things at once" moments, as well as some player interaction, which will probably prove more and more important with further plays. Replayability does not seem to be an concern, as there is variability both in setup (order of events) and in gameplay.

Purchased Essen 2007. When the rules were explained to me, this didn't sound much like Notre Dame, but during the game I couldn't help but recall that earlier Alea title. Something about the way you generate points, how if you collect the right sets those points can really rack up, but you have to play around negative events (rat count in Notre Dame, event tiles in this game). 
I bought this even though I already own Notre Dame. I think there are enough differences between them to offer unique gaming experiences. It's just that they both have the same sort of feel to them, behind their mechanics. 

The mechanics of In the Year of the Dragon are more interactive (which can be frustrating, when you don't get to do what you had planned). ItYotD gives you many options to think about and a great need to watch what your opponents are doing.

Some concerns over the Dragon scrolls being overpowered mean this game doesn't see as much play in my group as I'd like.

I should like this one.... lots of long term planning or "bad stuff" happens.  After 5 plays, I can say I don't like this game & I've come to realize the 2 things that I really dislike:  

1) If you make a mistake (e.g. don't have enough money to take an action that has already been selected), it's pretty much game over. Not only do you get stuck not being able to take the action that you desperately need), but you will probably lose some of your people which will snowball into more problems and losses later. If you are behind, you can't catch up.  People in the lead on the turn order track will always get the action they want and will continue to get further ahead making it impossible to catch them.  

2) People who get the double scroll on turn one are probably going to win... especially if they pick up books. In my last game, I tried minimizing any losses to focus on getting VPs for palaces, people & buddhas. I was last in turn order every time but had the money to make the  selection I wanted. I ended up with 6 palaces and only 1 person had to be sacrificed in a rice shortage. I ended up in last place in a 4-player game. Definitely was not very satisfying or fun.

{ P - 3 4 [5] }

We had competitive games of Dragon for a while with various strategies winning ... then someone discovered 6/5. After two people jumped on board, all of our games began to look very similar. Our starting positions became:

1. 6/5 Soldier
2. 6/5 Fireworks
3. Ho-Builder
4. Tax-Builder
5. Farmer-Builder

Some tenets:

[b]Points Matter, People Don't[/b]: Points per turn is everything for the first ten or so months, so the earlier the better for annuity benefits. It just so happens those months are peaceful, making them an ideal opportunity for starting this process. 6/5's will alternate privilege and build actions during those months for 5 points per turn by the second month. Ho-Builder doubles up build action and Lady recruitment unless Drought is early. 7 points per turn. (Else, 5 points per turn.) Any other Builder start can pay to build once or twice, potentially recruit another Builder for double-builds, and also potentially recruiting Ladies. Alternatively, Tax-Builder can build once, recruit a Tax Collector, (pay to) tax, then recruit a Lady.

[b]Other Setups Invalidated[/b]: Competing with 6/5 for high initiative is futile. 6/5 + 6 secures first and second highest initiative on the two turns that matter most, barring a 5/5 Soldier start and gambling for unpaired parade, which still only nets you 4 points per turn if successful. The start does restrict both 6/5's to 4 points per turn but you lose the building war because on the turn 6/5 Soldier is crowded out of build he faces the same parade gamble as you to surpass your initiative and swipe the turn three build. Assuming both work out, you're in worse shape. Other setups without Builder or Lady cannot score enough points per turn to compete. You can't really start with, say, Farmer Apothecary because the 6/5's take Privilege and Build and you're left hoping for unpaired Food, which is still a subpar action as it does not contribute to VP per turn. Moreover, you need to build at some point for capacity so there's no reason not to begin with a Builder and start early. Fireworks and Scholar, the straight VP options are also poor early choices weighed against having the VP per turn from a new building or Lady starting on month one.

[b]Mid-Game[/b]: The 6/5's start with the initiative lead and never relinquish it. They begin to recruit key pieces like 1-Farmer and 1-Apothecary as early as possible because this has a musical chairs effect where the other players follow suit and somebody gets left out. This is important because low initiative players are already out of the initiative race and they need the per-piece efficiency of those elders. 6/5's get to build and food for free, while at the same time hopefully blocking the tax action. 6/5's can also recruit Lady if their lead is secure. Tax Collector is another good recruit because you can tax to fully survive Tribute, while possibly blocking a good action paired with tax, as opposed to staying off the board to refresh to 3. Any extra money may later become a small privilege.

The fundamental problem is that high initiative is so good when one or two people have it, and so bad when three or more compete for it - meaning no third person should adopt the strategy as it is a certain loss. Thus, the only way to compete with the 6/5's is by using pieces with very low initiative (Lady, Builder, Tax Collector) and then the 6/5's can do much the same thing - recruit efficient, low initiative pieces as long as the initiative lead is safe. If low initiative has a magical trump card I've missed, the 6/5's still retain the power to apply pressure, either by drafting certain key pieces first or taking certain actions first.

A very fun, tense gaming experience.  There's quite a bit of long term planning with the upcoming events, but also a fair bit of tactical response to what your opponents choose to do.  Very streamlined and easy to learn, but plenty of depth to keep bringing me back.  Classic Feld.

The game mechanic that decides the player turn order is rather innovative and creates a lot of tension and player interaction in the game. The other game mechanic involving planning for the bad events during the year introduces a lot of depth into the game. The best part of it all is, despite its depth, play time is still rather short.

Some of the scoring seems skewed. Privileges costs the same amount of yuan throughout the game, but its value decreases linearly over the twelve months. No characters actually affect the purchase of privileges, so privileges can probably be removed completely from the game. The scoring for Mongol Invasion also seems low compared to say the Festival, i.e. there is less incentive for a player to finish first for helmets than for fireworks, though there is incentive to not finish last for the helmets.

Lastly, the artwork is at best average.

A very punishing game that tests one's ability to plan ahead.  In the Year of the Dragon is composed of a total of 12 turns, in which 8 of them contain some sort of disasterous events that will either exhaust your resources or cost you to lose your subjects.

My initial impression is that unless you get very lucky in the arrangement of the event tiles, it is nearly impossible to escape unscathed as you go through the game.  However, it isn't as bad as it sounds, because most of the personnel you recruit will no longer serve much purpose after certain incidents have passed, so they are expendable in a sense, even though you do receive 2 VP for every one that you are able to keep until the end.

The biggest problem I have with the game is in the scoring, and how overpowered the privileges and the Court Ladies are because they count as points after every single round.  So for example, if you pick a Court Lady as one of your two starting person, then buy the large privilege (with 2 dragons) on your first turn, that means you will be gaining 5 points (including the 2 palaces you begin with) for a total of 60 for the entire game even if you never construct additional buildings and discard all other subjects.  That just seem completely unbalanced to me, the ability to score that high no matter how poorly you do for the rest of the game.

Still, this is one of the better titles to come out of Essen in 2007, and I'm looking forward to trying it again.

Update #1: I'm seriously beginning to dislike this game, a lot.  Every play through is the same, regardless how the event tiles come out, it always ends up as a contest of influence.  I have tried several strategies that basically ignore the influence track and although I do not lose badly, there is no way to win either.  Due to the fact that influence dictates when you get to select the action tiles, going last every round means you get whatever is left.  Unfortunately, these actions are not created nor balanced equally.  Taxes and build are useful no matter what the situation is and rarely do they get skipped.  Privilege is only good if you have the money to spend.  Fireworks display and harvest are only situationally good, sure you can plan ahead, but after a certain point they are completely worthless.  Research and military parade are crap, period, especially to someone that isn't competing in influence.

A game that only rewards one type of play is poorly designed, and I'm afraid that In the Year of the Dragon is beginning to look guilty of that more and more.  Oh, by the way, I take back what I said about the court lady.  It has got to be the most severely under powered character.  Only 1 influence for 1 point per turn?  What a joke.  I've lowered the score from its original 7.5 as a result, won't miss this if I never play it again.

Un juego de gestión muy interesante, sin ser un top ten, pero que con una duración apropiada, y sin grandes dificultades se hace muy entretenido. Problemilla: si te quedas descolgado al principio, olvídate de la partida.

It's not that I don't like this game... I do.  But one of my most easy-going friends seemed almost offended that I would deliberately prevent him from defending himself from the mongols, and I know my girlfriend would hate it even more than he did.  So this won't see much table time.

A good game hard to classify and evaluate. More complex and longer than I'd prefer, has some interesting mechanics. This is not a fun game as it implies planning. One of the few I'll probably change the rating after some more sessions. Congrats to the author as I consider it as one "must have" in a game collection.

After 5+ Plays: I've liked this one since I first tried it.  It has a nice mix of playing against a brutal game system, and vying with the other players who are trying to trip you up.  With further plays I have been somewhat disappointed to find only one effective strategy.  This doesn't ruin the game, as the tactical choices are still great fun, but it's not as good as it could have been. 

After 10+ Plays: I'm still enjoying this one a lot, though there are a couple of quirks that bug me.  The first is that whoever goes first gets a big boost from a first turn double privilege, assuming the tax event isn't very early.  The second is that it appears to be impossible to win without staying near the front of the turn order track.  Good players can simply plan for this and it doesn't break the game, but it would be more interesting if there was a way to at least occasionally win from the back of the turn order pack.

--The minor expansion is worth picking up.  The major events are a nice touch, and while I've only played with the wall cards once, they seem like an interesting twist.

Played it 9 times in the past 6 years. I'm not sure how proficient one can be at a game when the plays are so few and far between. The reason i'm saying this is because as a group we have an issue with regards to the large Privilege strategy on the first turn. 8 out of 9 times the game has been won by the person who implements that strategy. The one exception was when a newbie to the game with 3 other experienced players tried it and lost.

This is certainly a beginner strategy that seems too strong and when other players don't get enough plays to become good at the game this becomes an issue. Maybe that's a problem with a group that does not play the games enough times.

As for the game itself, i like it. I have not played anything similar to this. There is a fair amount of interaction in almost all phases of the game (which action is taken, specialists, rankings for the events and turn order). There is a constant struggle against the bad things that are happening to you and your people but i don't mind that at all

I enjoy the game but would have enjoyed it more without the large Privilege Strategy.

Very bad game in terms of insturctional design and intuitive play. It offers a solid gameplay but also nothing really new or innovative. The board layout, the theme and the overall design is just plain bad.
If you still want to play it: it offers a good game for about an hour or more depending on the number of players. There's room for a lot of planing and cut-throat actions. Good game but with the competition and innovation around this one is clearly not on my to-buy list.

Кризисный менеджмент, но без кооперативной игры, в отличие от Эркхама или Галактики. Любая ошибка влечёт серьёзные последствия, каждый ход шаг влево, шаг вправо - смертный приговор. Замечательный баланс.

I originally rated this an 8. However I have now played this 5 times, and the last 2 times we have had real issues with people getting left behind early and not being able to do anything to catch up. Whilst probably their fault , its made the game a bit painful to complete.

One of the best games around. Extremely well balanced and good with any number of players. I used to play and win this often pure tactically (short time actions), but now - after many losses - it seems that the best way to win this is to play it strategically (long term), but you have to stick to it till the very end.

Solid designer game with plenty to plan forward to, some interaction, an interesting setting, and the need to switch gears throughout the game a few times. It requires scoring twelve times through the game, though, which is its only (slight) drawback.

Own the mini expansion.

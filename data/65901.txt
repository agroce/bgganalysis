It's hard to look at this as anything but a Brass expansion (in the same way that I treat all AoS maps as expansions to the base game). It certainly provides the same experience.

After a second (full) play, I can say that I definitely like it, but it is awfully similar to Brass.  I seem to have trouble converting money into useful buildings, as in both games so far, I only took two loans all game, and ended with over 40 dollars prior to the rail income.

เบากว่า brass แต่ดูเหมือน mid-weight gamer คนอื่นๆจะเข้าถึงได้ง่ายกว่าทำให้บรรยากาศโดยรวมสนุกกว่าเล่น brass เพราะคิดไม่ลึกเกิน

แต่ถ้าเล่นกับสายชอบเล่นเกมหนักๆเล่น brass จะสนุกกว่า

แต่กล่าวโดยสรุปถือเป็นคนล่ะเกมกับ brass และคงจะมีโอกาสเอาออกมาเล่นเยอะกว่า

update: พอกลับไปลองเล่น brass อีกทีพบว่าชอบระบบ zone สีของ AoI มากไม่จำกัดเกินไปเหมือนกับระบบชื่อเมืองของ brass (ตรงนี้มองเป็นเรื่องดวงมากกว่าการคำนวน) แต่เรื่องระบบ 2 ยุดทำให้ brass ยังเหนือกว่าในแง่การวางแผน

RATING: 8
Interesting variant on brass which feels quite different to it's predecessor - money feels tighter (good), but with less players, over the course of the game most players will end up building most of their industries, turning these choices into more about timing than long-term direction (bad). Interested in trying alternate maps to see how / if they address this.

The base game of this is ok.  I prefer Brass, I played it first. but also the map seems more interesting then those provided in AoI.  I've not got nor played the AoI expansion maps, I've heard they are good. but it's not looking like AoI is going to have any more maps released (official) which is a shame.

RATING: 8.5
Very able retooling of Brass. Age of Industry seems to be Brass Rebooted. A couple of plays in and I am enjoying both sides of the map. The external market variability goes a good distance for replayability and the two player game seems nicely balanced. I'd have more hope in seeing this coming to the table more often for more gaming fans at-large.

Played this twice now, and it's a good game. The rules seem a bit fiddly in places and I miss the income mini-game of Brass, but it seems sufficiently distinct to justify owning both. Looking forward to playing the other three maps now I've got the basic rules more or less to mind.

Gestión de acciones/construcciones y economía en la época de la revolución industrial, otro exprime cerebros, clon-variante del Brass ambos de Martin Wallace, éste se supone de duración algo menor. Es FEO y con ganas, los componentes son sosos y recomiendo reciclar el plástico de las "monedas" por amor al medio ambiente y al juego, y usar fichas de póker como con otros juegos económicos. Componentes aparte, ambos juegos me parecen JUEGAZOS, quizás lo ideal sería un punto medio con según que reglas de uno u otro juego. Por ejemplo, este tiene 2 mapas diferentes, pero le falta la gracia del contador de ganancias/puntos de victoria.

I very much prefer the concept of Brass. But Age of Industry is good game, too. I especially admire the expansions that actually bring something new to the game and do not just provide exactly the same game with just a minor twist.

Has some positives and negatives over Brass but overall think this is the better game. Much improved loan system, prefer the card drawing action mechanic rather than Brass' fixed turns and the coloured zones are much better than individual city cards. Don't think the ship side works very well though as it is too dependent on getting ship cards to work (which there are so few of).

Unfairly gets a lot of bad press from Brass fanboys but I like AoI for different reasons than I like Brass, AoI is more tactical than strategic as you have more options with your cards but you still need to focus to get to the top of your tech tree; developing is now a wasted action as there is no split between the eras. It's playable with two and is generally quicker once you get to know the system. I don't like it with 5 but then that applies to most games that go to 5.

Intense and thoughtful, but lacks the evolution necessary to justify the effort and length. Nice clean mechanics. More fiddly than it needs to be because critical game data resides on reference sheets rather than on the playing pieces (as it does in Brass); would be an 8 if it weren't for this problem. Weak for 2 players: run-away and solitaire problems.

I'm already a huge fan of Brass and had never played the new implementation of it. Great game, it is even more consistent than Brass, but with lesser strategy. It is compact and simplier with better resolution of buildings, but I still prefer Brass because of the strategy involved in the use of the Canal Phase.

I haven't played Brass, but I must say I love this one. Yet, I had the opportunity of playing it only in two, and after a while the game gets repetitive and long (in two it takes a lot to exhaust the drafting deck). I'm sure that this games works great with at least 3-4 players. Yet, needless to say, M. Wallace is always M. Wallace!!!! Excellent mechanics, easy to grasp rules and a lot of thinking in your gaming experience.

I'm pretty sure that I like AoI better than Brass (assuming you include the expansion maps). 

Overall, the variability of maps, broader card regions, equivalence of coal and iron, and the use of ports are all more interesting to me. But I also kind of like the canal/railroad phase break up of Brass and I think Brass's standalone map is superior to AoI's base maps.

I really like how the depth comes across in the emergent player interaction in both AoI and Brass. The expanding business empires and economic systems are intriguing and delightful. The games *look* bland, which is disappointing. But I enjoy the gameplay so much.

The streamlining process that turned Brass into Age of Industry has both positives and negatives for me.  On the plus side, Brass was a nightmarish game to teach and some of the rules just seemed like fixes, necessary to make the game work.  Age of Industry sweeps away the oddities and is very much easier to explain.  However, on early acquaintance, while Age offers plenty to think about, it feels a bit characterless in comparison to it's quirky, clunky parent.  My hope is for some radical expansion maps to re-inject some of the flavour that has been lost.

Version mas suavizada de Brass y mas asequible para mas tipos de jugadores sin perder la esencia del hermano mayor. .
Wallace modifico algunas de las caracteristicas de su clasico para acercarlo a mas gente y posibilitar el empleo de nuevos mapas lo que va en alza en lo que a jugabilidad se refiere. 

Una lastima que más gente no le de una oportunidad por las eternas comparaciones con Brass; al igual que éste ultimo jugable en pareja con variantes.

Muy recomendable.

Didn't do too well on my first play, it didn't really click and unfortunately this has meant I haven't sought it out again-- but it deserves another play. As I have Brass, probably not worth buying. It's hard to keep the slightly different rule sets separate in my head.

RATING: 8
One of the best game of M. Wallace, Age of Industry is definitely not for beginners. It's a heavy euro with lots of hard decisions and one of my the best game I played this year. I would recommend this to anyone tired of the typical worker placement and in a 3 or 4 players. You can build a basic strategy about half way through your first game and a good strategy in your second game.

RATING: 7
June 2011:  Rating 5 of !0. Very uninteresting in almost all respects. No desire to play again.

October 2012: Second play, after having, by now, "studied" and played this game's predecessor Brass.  I would raise this game to a 7 (and give Brass an 8).

  Brass, I believe, is the better gamers' game, with lots going for it. Brass deserves the higher rating.  Of course, neither game is going to work very well with non-gamers. 

As I see it, Age of Industry is an improvement over Brass in a few respects, and a step in the wrong direction in MANY respects.  

In Age of Industry, I really miss the very pleasing "eight card hand management" magic of Brass.  I really miss the card countdown mechanic of Brass.  I miss the "pay a card to take up to three loans" mechanic of Brass.  I miss the income phase of Brass. (Yes, humans like to get paid!) I miss the "loans diminish your income" on an interesting income track of Brass. I miss the city cards of Brass. Heck, I even miss the "canal phase cleaning the board a little bit" phase of Brass.  

In Age of Industry, I don't like VP's in large measure being a product of how much money you have at the end of the game.  I don't like having to stare at loan chits most of the game, and paying interest on loans every turn rather than receiving income (negative gaming experience versus positive gaming experience.)  I don't like loans still outstanding at the end of the game docking you 5 VP's which again, forces you to stare at, and obsess over a negative thing in front of you - loans.  I don't like development not costing you anything.  And, aesthetically, I don't like staring at a bunch of "X's" on the board when chits flip over. 

I REALLY don't like the decision to sacrifice one of your precious actions in the hope, the prayer, that you will draw two good cards.  And if you don't draw two good cards?  You have just wasted an action.  Thus, this mechanic is really an exercise in paying a cost, and pushing for, and hoping for, good luck.  Yawn.  Irritation.  It feels trite from a game design, and game experience, perspective. (By contrast, Brass gives every player two cards, every turn, at no cost, and allows you to "burn" bad cards throughout the game very strategically, to get your loans, to build tracks, thus creating an interesting, pleasing, hand management mechanic.)

Age of Industry does helpfully simplify the chit cost/VP iconography.  It does give you cargo to ship, which is nice.  It seems to improve on the clunky shipping cotton overseas mechanic.  It does offer lots of new and interesting maps, and I think the New England map is really good, with some interesting strategic possibilities.  The German side of the map?  Not so much.

All in all, Age of Industry is an interesting but lesser variant of Brass.  Brass has some magic in it, which explains its lofty (perhaps a bit unexpected for such a complicated and fiddly game) high perch in the BGG rankings. Age of Industry does not have the Brass magic.  The interesting question going forward for those who appreciate Brass is whether a better variant of Brass than Age of Industry is on the horizon.  It seems like it should be out there.

Martin Wallace's reworking of Brass.  It's a bit shorter, but it's otherwise more or less the same game.  I worry that this time out the cards associated with regions are simply much better than the cards associated with industries, since there are more places they can be used, and like the city cards in Brass, they have fewer restrictions.

This games shares much that I do not like with Brass.  I find the theme somewhere between odd and actively unhelpful.  I don't understand what victory points are supposed to represent, or why I can only build in certain places, etc.  It doesn't feel like I'm building up industry.  I also found it a bit clunky: rules about how you must be connected, when things go to the foreign markets, etc.  If you're a fan of Brass, there's a lot to like here, but it doesn't substantially change the game.

+ Nice production, the potential for expansions is always welcome.
- I honestly can't see why I would play this instead of Brass. It's more bland and less tense. I can't say I agree with any of the changes, it just makes it less challenging and strategic. And if you're looking for this because it's supposed to be lighter in terms of rules, it isn't. You'll only be getting a worse game.

Age of Industry is definitely a refined version of Brass.  It is clear that some of the oddness in the Brass rules have been worked out, but at the same time, the game feels like it loses a touch of its driving theme for the sake of a streamlined game design.  This gives Age of Industry a slightly more abstract feel.

The game's design is very solid and flexible and this allows for the introduction of new game maps that have a decidedly large impact on the game play.  The reaction one has to the game will likely depend strongly on which map is played and by how many players.  This fact makes rating the game hard.  Brass is a well developed and balanced game in respect to both the game rules and the map.  Age of Industry is likely a better rule set, but the maps may be less balanced and integrated.  In the end, this disconnect between rules and board make Age of Industry slightly less attractive than Brass. But at the same time, Age of Industry is a game that bubbles with far more potential than Brass.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My rating will probably go up, but I want to play the Europe side at least once and the New England side again. So far, I think improves upon Brass significantly. I don't feel that I miss much of Brass here. In fact, I think Age of Industry improves upon Brass by requiring loans (a la Age of Steam) and demanding that you use an action to draw up cards.

First impression after two plays with 3. Although the basic setup is similar, the game plays very differently from Brass.

I think in the end I still prefer Brass, for the moment it feels deeper and more strategic, though with a bit less variety (the two maps play rather differently in AoI). But I'm looking forward to playing again and exploring the different strategies.

Very satisfying economic game.  I got trounced in my first and only play but I enjoyed the journey.  Has all the hallmarks of this sort of design - especially the feeling of being behind the 8-ball when it comes to taking loans and paying interest.  I found it a lil strange at first that all your industries offered a one-time payout (rather than a steady flow of income), but you get used to it.

I also felt a lil bit of a lul in the mid game but the lack of tension probably came as a result of me not quite knowing what was going on.

On the downside - The map looks like a prototype map.  I'm all for "clear and easy to read" but this could use a lil jazzin up as far as I'm concerned.

RATING: 7
Based on onlyone play.  I have to admit this game goes one step beyond of what I feel confortable with.  Not an easy game.  Rules are not extremely complex, but not easy either, with quite a lot of details.  And game play is also not that easy, in the sense of having some kind of strategy.  Components are quite good in general, except the personal board, which is VERY poor for a game that price.  Deluxe edition includes wood pieces for trains.  Too little to call it deluxe...
I somehow enjoyed the game, but was not certain of what I was doing.  Obviously it would need more plays (which I do not think I really want to give).
I may be wrong, but have the feeling that luck involved in the cards you draw can be too important for such a deep game.
I have been told this is like Brass, a bit simplified.  That makes me certain I do not need to try Brass...

RATING: 5
By reading the rules it seemed like a very good game, theme- and mechanism-wise. However it took us 2,5 hours to finish the first game and we felt like it overstayed its welcome. On top of that the game is really fiddly (the turn order mechanism specifically, where you need to keep track of spent money). To sum up for the time it takes to play the game, it didn't provide enough fun. Halfway through the game my group said it could've finished at that point, at I second that, it's just too long.

RATING: 7.5
The "streamlined" Brass is quite a different game from its predecessor. The streamlining process took away most of the character from the game, but the design gained indeed in elegance.
The removal of the canal period reduces game lenght as well as many chances for clever long term strategic plays. There's also many other different details (the iron is managed like coal, the ships that open resources, the easier to manage loans, the non-automatic card-drawing, many actions performed without discard) that turn the same core-engine of Brass in a truly different beast.
I feel Age of Industry is not as good as Brass (but, hey, that is a masterpiece!), although it is a very very good game, and the chance to play on different maps is really a bonus...

It's completely normal if you compare this with brass and that was during the first part of the game the item to discuss about. But the changes makes it another game anyway.

Look forward to play it again.

AoI is basically the same system as Brass.  However, some of the dynamics are missing, such as the canal era, income track manipulation, and the risks/rewards of the distant market. 

Why play AoI over Brass?  Well, AoI supports up to 5 players, the Germany map is an easier introduction, and I actually prefer the perfect information of the AoI markets to the random flipping of the distant markets.  That said, I still prefer Brass or Brass: Catalonia.   

[b] Germany[/b]
Germany has several isolated cities that have a coal space connected to a distant port.  In these locations a player can build a level 2 or 3 coal mine without the use of any rail.  There are also a lot of single-spaced cities, which sort of forces players to use a lot of coal and iron for rail building.  Ships are not used for this map.  This is considered the introductory board.     

[b] New England [/b]
The focus of this map is on Ships.  The port and ship spaces usually fill up quickly.  Coal Mining is especially limited.  I recommend building near the port spaces in the early game.  This is considered the standard board.   
   
[b]Japan: AoI Expansion #1[/b]
The card display adds interesting timing & investing decisions.  The shipping lanes also give players more options for using industry cards... unless you draw a bunch of face-down Coal Mines or Iron Works.  Iron can get rather pricey whereas coal is always dirt cheap.        

[b]Minnesota: Print'n'play[/b]
I've created a Minnesota map for AoI, which is located in the files section.  All 6 industries are fully represented on this map.  Coal is expensive and the rail choke points make for more costly builds.  For this map you need to sell iron cubes in order to flip a ship.      
     
[b]Minnesota: AoI Expansion #1[/b]
Martin Wallace further developed AoI: Minnesota into an official expansion.  The 'sell' action has been expanded to incorporate both coal and iron cubes. 

[b]Great Lakes: Print'n'play[/b]
During setup, you randomly select 2 of the 5 zones (there is no brown zone) to be +3 Profit Color Zones.  This rule alone should provide enough variability to keep each session as fresh and interesting as the Great Lakes.  The main timing decision for this map is the winter closures of the St. Lawrence Seaway.

AoE is a fantastic game. I can't comment on how it compares to [GAMEID=28720] as I'venot played it. AoE requires the players to make a number of critical decisions and pursue their strategy to the fullest to win.

I love Brass, so I'm guessing I will appreciate this one.  It's also more likely to hit the table due to the streamlining.  

Update: I played for the first time today and while I still like Brass better, this is definitely a good set up for 2-player.  It's close enough to Brass that I don't feel like I need to own this one too.  The economics of this one, while very similar to Brass, I feel are a bit oversimplified.  I also prefer the scoring method for rails and canals in Brass, with the direct generation of points from these connection rather than income that is converted to points.  I have played Brass a lot, but this was my first attempt at AoI, so I reserve the right to change my opinions on these things as my play count increases.  A certain amount of Brass has to be unlearned to play AoI effectively, and that may be my problem.  Still, it is a very good game, and I like having two different goods types to sell at market.

Seems pretty good.  I learned Brass first and like it a bit more.  But, I've only played Age of Industry once and it was on the Japan map.  I want to try it again so I can get a feel for how much I like it and see better how it compares to Brass.

I've played it twice now (second play on the Boston - or whatever its called - map).  I think one of the players summed it up best before we started, "this is just like Brass but not as good."  It's a pretty good game, but Brass is a great game!

RATING: 5
the game is done well but compared to brass there are some things that I did not like:
- Maps variables are not well integrated with industry. Basically in some maps using a few ships, others use a few mines. and this can be for those who like to play with different maps. I'm not one of them.! but for those who like to change the map (as in power grid) surely this is the best purchase
- Scalability in 2 is not as good as it should be.
- For a matter of taste, I prefer the Regulation of brass.
although it compares to brass, and as graphic as mechanical, the choice between the two is just a matter of taste.

I was lured into playing Age of Industry yesterday and still have to shrug off the dead bore of putting down random tokens, seeing random things happen and doing random things all the time with no other motive than «because the rulebook states so»: it’s such a dull game I’d have had a better time staring at a blank wall.

Why should I play this instead of Brass? 
I know its not the same game, but it sure feels like the same.

I've played only the "simple" version, but it didn't seduce me.

Brass is more deep. I think this is just "milking the cow". An easy way to make money. New boards will come from everywhere. 

I might play it occasionally, but it will always feel a Brass simplified.

Decent game, very dry.  Felt like I lost because one player decided to overbuild one of my buildings and it was the only only time that happened during the game, I think I lost by the amount that that building would have scored.

Brass is better. 

I prefer the longer 2 stage process of Brass rather than the "streamlined" AoI. The cards in Age of Industry appear to be less rigid, but there are still the same limits on connectivity in many cases, plus not having more than one counter per city. 

I Can see why a valid tactic in this game is to just get more cards early on so that you have a lot more to select from.

Now that expansion maps with very cool rules tweaks are being published (hopefully more to come), I definitely will always choose this game over Brass.  Probably time to get rid of my copy of Brass... The biggest thing I LIKE about Brass that is missing in Age of Industry is the income track.  I guess all my RRT game playing is speaking here, but I like the fact that income tracks reward players making early investments in possibly sub-par technology.  In Age of Industry the only reason to build lower yielding technology industries is to take advantage of a particular resource depletion or to get a footing on the map.  Oh well, AoI is still a great game.

RATING: 8
Lots of discussion of this attracted me to it although I already own and love Brass. I took a flyer and bought it -and was not disappointed (phew!). Yes, the lineage is clear and some of the play similar. But, even after only one play I can see that this game will have its own personality and dynamics, which will vary from board to board.

And that is what makes it for me - a location specific system has been broadened to make it playable on different maps. I look forward to seeing expansions to the system hopefully along the same lines as we saw for AoS.

I will still happily play Brass, but I now have another similarly themed but expandable game that I look forward to enjoying also. I can see why Martin said that this is what he wishes Brass had been from the outset.

Update: I'm afraid that the expansions while promised have not expanded the game's interest as I'd hoped. The Brass system has been so streamlined and "vanilla-ized" here that it really needs something to maintain one's interest which I thought/hoped expansion maps might provide. Making the card deck usable from one map to another was quite clever, but the impact of removing the Canal Phase is proving to be the "Achilles Heel" of Age of Industry - it has drained much of the magic away. We'll see but at present this game is not hitting the table much anymore. The best I can say for now is that if you really want a Brass-ish experience but have five players, this is available...

Now played 5 times the Germany map with newbies and 2 times New England, and there is a true difference between them. Coal is much more important in New England. The three played 4 & 5 player matches were real meaty matches. Watch out not to deliver a cash cow for your opponents. AoI and Brass are IMO different enough, let´s say like Twilight Imperium 2nd & 3rd Edition. 
A two player version of GREAT LAKES are P&P made as a Poster map & rules; i played it once and it was a sufficient experience. All 4 gameboards (latest was 2015 with Belgium & U.S.S.R.) fits well in the box, but now there is no place left. Also P&P are a few sheets to calculate the final scores. It´s a shame that this is not included in this high priced product!

I know people keep comparing this to Brass, but it's hard not to.  compared to Brass, it lacks the money management tension which makes the game feel both easier and more forgiving.  However, it is also a whole lot easier to teach which put together means it is a lot easier to get it played.  The biggest difference between AoI and Brass is that loans can be taken and redeemed at any time and that the only way to get cash is by either taking loans or flipping tiles; there is no income engine like Brass.  These differences give it a very different feel that I enjoy.

On its own: VPs comes from 2 sources: cash (5:1) and placed tiles.  Thus the game is all about spending VPs to generate more VPs.  Players use cash to place tiles that get resources that can be consumed allowing the tiles to be flipped and cash generated.  There is also a network building aspect both as another source of cash (VPs) and to help with placing tiles.  It's a solid game and different enough from most of the churn-and-burn Euros that it feels worth keeping.  Also there are several expansion maps that help keep it refreshing.

Takes Brass, which I absolutely love, and streamlines and improves it!

One major improvement is that the game is now open to expansion maps, which will really increase the variety from game to game.  Even when using the same map, there is a bit of random set-up that will influence your strategy from game to game.

I also like that there is no longer an income track.  You just pay interest on outstanding loans, paying them back when possible.

The new rules also improve what I felt was a slight problem with Brass, which was that rails were far too important to end game scoring.  Now, the emphasis is more about maximizing industry counter points, rather than building a crapton of rail near the end-game.

There are also some clever new rules on the New England map having to do with shipyards which add a cool twist to the game.  I'm very excited to see the added twists that other maps will add to this game, much like we have with Age of Steam maps.  I can see that there will be very varied gameplay between maps, which will be an awesome thing!

In the end, I'll probably end up playing this over Brass since it's both easier to teach and more interesting in some regards.  As a result, this gets a "9" and my Brass rating goes down to "8".  Good stuff!

I played AoI a couple of months after I played Brass, and I know that most people prefer the game they played first, but I think I slightly prefer AoI. It’s less convoluted and has fewer things going on, but I don’t think it’s a “lesser” game. There are still lots of tough decisions, but ultimately I’ve found that Wallace’s games aren’t games I’m thrilled about. I like and respect the designs, but it feels like something is missing…

There are a couple of different strategies, and the game truly rewards foresight and knowledge of the game, but the players themselves create a new game each time; something I’m usually a fan of.

It’s inevitable that AoI is going to be compared to Brass. The two games are very alike, but the streamlined rules (without compromising the relatively heaviness of the game itself) in AoI gives it a slight advantage over Brass. I like the scoring system better, i.e. that you don’t have a point track and a money track. The fact that there is only one era and no bridges actually makes the game better I think as it removes some “clunkiness” without compromising the gameplay.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Slightly more streamlined than Brass though the railway scoring isn't as good. In Brass players are rewarded for connecting major areas of industry. In AoI players are rewarded for laying track pretty much anywhere.

I think I still prefer Brass, but that may just be a matter of my own preference for more obtuse thematic games.  

Age of Industry is a game flush with possibilities whereas Brass is more concerned with telling a particular story (though it does allow players lots of freedom for clever play within that story).

As a design, Age of Industry stands at eye level with its older brother.  Despite sharing a large chunk of rules, the game offers a very different challenge.  Networking feels more important and the constricted board means that there is a real fight for position.  The income/loan/victory point system is a major improvement.  Ignore posts about how all the industries feel too similar, any examination of their profit margins and costs cuts through their critique.  Thus far I've seen every industry effectively utilized: they feel like a set of precision tools.  The develop action is also great, but is seldom an obvious move.  

The whole package is one slick machine that I cannot wait to replay.  There is a larger amount of good moves but they are far less apparent.  Even more than the possibilities for new maps, this breaths a real life in to the game.  Wallace has a serious winner that will stand with the best of his Warfrog days.  

Update (about a year and a half later):  Still excellent.  Quickly becoming one of my favorite Wallace titles and sits well with Princes, Struggle, AoS and Liberte in the highest echelon of his canon.

Its impossible not to compare to Brass, but I find the two games surprisingly distinct. The things I found myself thinking about on my turn, and the type of planning I was doing, they didn't feel remotely similar to what I do in a game of Brass.

This was a thoughtful gift from my Secret Santa. I'm looking forward to many more playings. I also hope there are options for more maps.

I love the production quality of this game.  The wooden coins with printed dollar values are just what I spent six months trying to find as replacements for Brass's coins! The wooden trains are great looking too. A slight complaint is that having punched and bagged all the components, the bags do not seem to easily fit in the box's insert. The game takes 120 minutes to complete in my experience. That is with either 3 or 4 players. My friends seem to prefer Brass to AoI. I think that, having played it a few times, I agree. It isn't far behind Brass though in my opinion. It is much easier to explain than Brass and there is no Birkenhead rule equivalent.  The potential for new maps is also a plus point as is the option for a fifth player.

AoI takes Brass, one of my favorite Wallace games, and streamlines it down to what has to be one of the most elegant games in the industry at this complexity level. Which is not to say that the rules are terribly complex (although they are for a euro, just not for a strat or wargame), just that the complexity is in making good decisions based on a long term strategy. As with the revision of Steam over AoS, so has AoI done the same with Brass to make a much better game. Having multiple maps (each with their own challenges!) helps as well.

Martin Wallace has produced a brilliant gaming system of expanding industries and making money. I can see the heritage of Age of Steam in terms of starting small and developing a network. Age of Industry affords long term planning to get maximum VP and in game opportunities to grab some quick VPs in the coal or iron markets. The expansion maps really make the game system shine and the Great Lakes two player map is excellent. The game scales well with three to five players and can be quite the brain burner as the game comes to a close. There are fewer and fewer opportunities on the board and squeezingf for th elast few dollars may give you the win.

The same feel as Brass but different enough to be interesting. Not as dense as the original, probably due to the simpler structure (no canal phase, for instance). Doesn't have the oddball exceptions of Brass, either.  I miss the income track and the ability to manipulate it with loans as well as the two phase structure.  As they add boards, gives sort of the same experience as Age of Steam: playing roughly the same game with different maps and rules changes that force modifications to your base strategy. Ultimately, though, I'd rather just play Brass.

We are basically speaking here of the same game as "Brass":

Several things are better in Brass, a few are better here.
Brass is more "elegant", since you have a thematic and preparatory "channel phase" and the pace of the draft sets the lenght of the game. It does also requires a better planning and hand managment, because the cards are more restrict than here.
In Age of Industry, there is the advantage of having more maps and also the necessity of paying iron when laying tracks, which makes sence. The game is also more "friendly", as the cards are more flexible, but perhaps this also makes the game a bit less interesting.

Just would rather play Brass. Knowing Brass really makes the "more streamlined" rules here too confusing. Certainly a fun game in its own right.  Saw some varying strategies with focus on different industries as well as with the amount of debt taken on.  So far, seems to be balanced in these regards.  Market tiles offer a nice variance to gameplay.  Loans work much differently than in Brass, and much of the game takes some *unlearning* if one already is familiar with Brass.

Despite having several maps, playing 2-5 and being a little simpler... Age of Industry does not ultimately improve on Brass (from which it is derived).

Money (income, loans and interest) is not as interesting, nor is there as much long-term planning--since there's no pre-rail canal age, here... just a rail age.

Brass's rule oddities regarding iron are eliminated here, making it just a second form of coal. Yes, the discrepancy between the handling of iron and coal is gone... but the end result is that iron isn't really as interesting, here.

Lastly, the value of rails seems very much lessened in Age of Industry, virtually eliminating rail-building as a major aspect of a winning strategy.

Age of Industry is a fine game, but it's derived from a stellar game.

Brass, all the way.

Martin Wallace is pretty much hit and miss for me, and many a time it's a miss, primarily due to the fact that his games are often burdened with heavy, complex, and sometimes unintuitive rules, with million exceptions and special cases all over the place. On the other hand, the hits are spectacular - Steam/Age of Steam is in my opinion one of the best games ever designed. And Brass/Age of Industry looks like being one of the hits again. It has some similarities with the Steam design, and has all the tension and tough decisions, and it is deep, but not unnecessary complex - although in saying that, I'm mostly talking about Age of Industry, which I prefer to Brass precisely because it is much more streamlined.

Played once so far and that was with the #1 expansion. May have been better to start with just the base set. Was a little underwhelmed but I think will play better once I understand what is going on.

Second play, this time just using the base game (Germany map) and the game was still a little opaque after the game explanation and it really needed the first play through to see it work. In truth it's not hugely difficult and having stumbled through this play now I like the look of what I see and look forward to playing again.

Having now played Brass I'm not entirely sure what AoI is trying to do - why did they not just do a few spins on the Brass engine for different scenarios?

Age of Industry is Martin Wallace’s streamlined reworking of Brass. This streamlining was sufficient to make me wary of the game, as I typically find that streamlined versions of older games, particularly Martin Wallace games, are not as good as the original. I can understand the appeal of a wider variety of maps, but this is not enough to make up for what I perceive as lackluster gameplay. I will not be playing this one again.

Players take on the role of barons during the industrial revolution, building railways, factories, ports, etc.  Players take turns taking two actions, spending cash and playing cards to place infrastructure on the map.  Infrastructure flips when used, turning it into victory points, and allowing it to be developed further.  Basically this is a more streamlined version of Brass, which is a good thing, with a bit of crud cut out, but some rather friendly rules added back in (unflipped tiles still score ... really?  Where's the risk?).  I enjoyed it and will happily play again.

RATING: 8
a great economic development game, akin to a cutthroat version of Power Grid. There's lots of factors in the equation: resource scarcity, building permits, payoffs for providing resources, track layout, and ultimately how those will end up creating victory points. 

Yet with all those factors in the mix, the game clips along quickly since you only get two actions per turn. I'm a tad wary about the turn order rules, as people who are penalized by unfortunate timing have to pay more for things and then get again penalized by squashing them for turn order. 

I highly recommend jumping to the America map as soon as everyone has had a single learning game! The Germany map doesn't really make nearly as many interesting decisions as the American.

Brass rip off. Some differences: Income (Brass) vs One time payout (AoI), Ships for sealanes, AoI scores buildings wether they're flipped or not.

Developing is minor. I don't think you can plan too much, it's more reacting to your card draw. Since you can't build more than one building per city your options are very limited.

I prefer playing Brass, but don't mind to play this every once in a while.

Strictly speaking, I prefer Brass to AoI, but I enjoy this system for the variety of maps it offers and for the fact that it’s easier to get it played. Brass usually requires one or more beatdown plays before players get up to speed, but new players can jump into this one fairly easily. 

While the some of the depth of Brass is lost here, you gain with new maps and rules. The maps add a lot of special rules that make each map a different play, not just a different geography. And whereas you had to take an action to take loans in Brass, here you have to take an action to take cards. This adds a competitive element to the game because you might take cards your opponent wants or you might have to interrupt the timing of your plans to reload on cards. 

All in all, I get AoI played a lot more than I did with Brass, and I enjoy the rules tweaks and the variety of experiences the maps offer. In particular:

GER = Unplayed. Too simplistic
NE = Reasonably good intro map but with the new maps now, I see no reason to revisit
MIN = You fight for coal in Chicago; the “iron ridge” gives your mines more cubes and $
JPN = You can *buy* cards to modify an action you're taking. So while the board taketh in terms of how tight it is, the card tableau giveth with the ability to get cards AND take actions on the same turn
SA = You can pay other players to use their railways to place industry you’re not connected to; gold and diamond mines offer more goods to ship
USSR = Unplayed

Reminders:
1) a port counter must be present in the space to build ship
2) you can overbuild different types of industry as long as the new one is a higher tech
3) building over a ship means the ship will not flip again (don't refill the coal)

This is a streamlined version of Brass, or so the saying goes. It certainly has been streamlined. But is it still Brass?

Hardly. The simplified rules make the game more accessible for new players, but they also mean that many of the interesting quirks in Brass, the differences between industry types, even the need for an overarching strategy to a large extent were thrown overboard.

The only feature AoI has going for it compared to its ancestor is the potential for expansions. However, even that comes for a price: you now need to consult a reference sheet to see what industries cost or how much income they generate when flipped.

This game seemed to have the most potential for a game I would enjoy. There are some neat things going on, and it's a struggle to stay out of debt. However, the rules never really solidified into something cohesive in my brain. Planing for a turn might go something like this: 

"I want to buy a railroad here, but coal is really expensive. Maybe I should build a coal mine there instead. I meet the requirements for using a color card, but I don't have one of the right color. I have a coal card, but the requirements for this are different. Ok, I meet the requirements for the card, and I've got the money, and I've ready to build."

Once I start my play however, I find out that I had to build on a space that had a coal symbol. If I were building an Iron source instead, though, I could built anywhere. However, using my Iron card requires that I have a railroad there, which is what I wanted to build in the first place. 

I'm not sure if the rules should be simpler, or if a different theme would make the different restrictions more clear. Or, possibly, it could just be me. I never felt like I had a clear goal, and a reasonable good idea of how to achieve that goal.

A new version of Brass that tries to both simplify and make the maps generic for use with multiple maps.  First play was pretty blah.  All of the interesting fiddly rules from Brass are gone as is the split money/points system.  I don't think this one is better than Brass for me.  I never understood the point of having multiple maps as it wasn't the distribution of towns that made Brass interesting in the first place.

I had never played the base game of Age of Industry (nor Brass for that matter) but it didn't affect playing this game with the variant 2-player map. AoI is frustrating in that it isn't a game that you can really understand until it is well underway and you can see how its separate parts start affecting each other. That being said, once it starts ramping up, it becomes a rather tense, interesting economic game. It certainly has some wacky mechanics, but it the end it all makes sense and comes together to come up with something quite different. I'd be quite interested playing this 3+ players, but a 2-player game of this works very well and I'd certainly do it again!

Wow, a game that goes nowhere.  I am doing the same things on the last turn as I am the first.  This game has no narrative arch, only continued congestion.  

I have said it so many times, Oregon does this game so much better.  The tactical card play, to drop and play buildings for points without the convoluted point conversions, is so much cleaner and more efficient in Oregon.  And it does it in 45 minutes compared to the slog that Age of Industry is.  

This isn't depth it is unnecessary bloat.

I was nervous before playing, since I had read a few luke-warm comments about this one. However, that worked in my favor, since I ended up liking it more than I expected.

I warned my opponents that my previous introduction was wrong: it's not "Brass Lite" but more just "Brass Different," and that certainly held true.

I liked most of the changes, but they don't necessarily speed up the game at all. I was frustrated that several times my old Brass-thinking led me to poor decisions in AoI. I look forward to playing it again to rectify that, and to experience it with a different number of players.

The first play through was very eye opening. For the first 1/2 hour, hour or so, we played without paying the players for building coal mines or iron works when the market was replenished, and the game started to feel a little stifling.  Until I found the ruling to correct our error.  Though this discovery through the game way out of balance (the next player raked it in building both resources with his actions and replenishing a very empty foreign market) it also made the game way more fun and interesting.
It's nice to have that learning play out of the way so we can try it again, properly.

Game is flavorless. I have the impression of flipping numbers, I don't feel like I am playing the industrial revolution, just numbers here and there.

It is playable, but I feel the game is half done, that the designer went half way with his idea or the work.

It lacks depth and replayability. It's too Ticket to Ride, and not enough industrial revolution. It's way too light a game to be about something as serious as the industrial revolution... I don't even know why you have money in the game, you could even remove that and play like Ticket to Ride while at it...

Finally a Wallace economic game I can get behind! The building constraints are occasionally counter-intuitive, but other than that the system is not obtuse at all (high praise for a Wallace) and allows you to focus on the trade-offs you must make. The economy is very clever and the gears interact with each other in lots of cool ways.

Rating would be completely different if there was no "Brass", so that's no real / fair rating, see below.

The few changes make this very different, as it's even more tight and the whole feeling is just different. There's no point or money track (which I miss), but on the other hand it's more logical (you can't teleport iron) and the card system (being an action) adds a nice touch of timing to the game. I'm not sure if the latter would be a good addition to Brass, but I like it nonetheless.

Anyway, with the new version of Brass coming, plus me favoring Brass, there's no point in playing this one instead.

Tips: get your industry out quickly. spread out and get at least one of each type.  Don't let one person get all of ________ .  Think of each RR as one point, so don't go crazy with them at the expense of industry.  You can only build RR once, while industry can be over built.

Is it better than Brass? It is similar, for sure, sharing the some of the mechanics. If you already own Brass, I do not really see why you should get Age of Industry.

This seemed simple, deep and clever. So it ticks a lot of boxes but unfortunately it's so deep that the tactics seem quite oscure to me.

I'm only one play in, came last but normally I can tell where I went wrong and how to come more like second or so second time round but the first place and second place both played completely differently. Ok so multiple paths to victory... this game gets even better.

Well not exactly, I couldn't quite get exactly how either of their tactics had really worked other than that they had seemed to get lucky with others using their goods and them getting one or two nice train routes, also the coloured area cards seemed overpowered to my newbie brain and with hindsight I wasted them.

The extra maps gain this game a half a point or so in replayability but I'm not exactly wowed by it.

---

Second play was 4 years later so may as well treat it like a new game. There's a lot to take in and you need to know where the points are going to come from.

Lots of different routes to go down but essentially you need a way of making things and turning those things into money... then you need this method to be sustainable and hopefully score points as you go through the train lines

It's a very good game :)

Forget it as a shorter simpler verision of Brass; it's a different game that share some mechanics but most of Brass Strategies are not so effective here. Very good way to spend your time; half point less than Brass because Brass is a bit more unforgiving...

Brass redeveloped. This is Brass with all the rough edges filed off, all the special rules removed. Unfortunately most of the character has been removed as well, so the industry characteristics which gave the original its rather quirky charm have been made much more bland and generic, there's no 'cotton strategy' or 'shipyard strategy' here. You're still limited by what cards you get and the restriction to one industry in most locations means that those getting location cards are at a significant advantage as these can be built without using actions to extend your track first. This combined with tight scoring creates a rather arbitrary "One more dollar, I'd have won" feel at the end. Not one of Martin Wallace's best.

I was really excited to hear about a streamlined, expandable version of Brass. However, I didn't really get what I wanted from it.  

First, don't expect too much from the streamlining; it's still a very complex and rather fiddly game and it's still easy to lose rules. 

Second, I found that I missed the canal age, or rather, I missed the chance to start over halfway through the game.  Since the board never clears off, I think that the game is now too long.  Toward the end, players' options suddenly disappear because there is no room left on the board and it feels as if the game is already over.  

Third, I wasn't a big fan of the way that loans work.  Since you can take as many loans as you want whenever you like, cautiousness is quite severely punished and making money matters little; the point is to take out lots of loans and build the big things immediately.  This loses the feeling of building up your economy until you can do something really cool, which is kind of the fun part of economic games for me.

That said, it is quite a bit like Brass, and I DO like Brass.  But it's a weaker game. (1 play)

The rules are a nightmare, but once the game got rolling it was quite fun.

The cards seemed stupid; I had great luck with them, but it seems like they are an unnecessary element that might only cripple some people.

Also do not like the building over other people's stuff rule if the coal/iron demands are empty; whoever gets lucky enough to end up with them empty is at a huge advantage.

First played July 14th, 2010. Taught in 20 min, played in 2 hours with 5 players. Each player is given a game area with industry chits, trains, and 6 location/industry cards. On the first round you get one action (random player goes first), subsequent rounds you get 2 actions. Sequence all take actions, pay interest and determine player order for the next round. Order is based on least money spent during the round and tie breaker is position order in the previous round. For your actions, you may 1) draw two cards from the face down stack or 2 face up cards, 2) build a industry (coal, ship, ???) for appropriate goods, ship a good, 3) pass and discard a card. Industry items cost money so you will have to take a loan out to start and may take more out later. One gold per each load of $10 taken out. Game ends when at least one player runs out of cards AND the draw stack and face up cards are drawn. This takes a while to figure out and play, so it may be best to pass on it unless you are really looking for a new game to try.

I have no idea how this one compares to Brass, but I know it is a good game. Not too difficult to understand with a manual that is actually quite easy to follow. You can even start playing after reading it once (you will check some things during play, but still - it can be done).

Age of Industry plays well with any number of people (just use one of the variants - or don't, you can play it without any modifications). It takes a reasonable 30-40 minutes per player. Good game, check it out.

After 1 play on the basic map (Germany).

Brass for the poor.  It's lighter, simpler, less demanding and... less fun than Brass.
It's just worse.

It's visibly more tactical than Brass - only optimize your current move, almost no strategy.  Whatever you do is OK.  Deliver and/or use coal/iron all the time.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Boooring.

If you have Brass, that's enough.  DO NOT buy Age of Industry (not only similar, but worse).
  If you are to buy 1 of them, choose Brass without hesitation.

Rating after 1 play.  Previously I've played Brass 3 or 4 times in person and maybe 5 times online and I love Brass.  I never found Brass to be difficult to learn or play so other than being easier to create expansion maps for, I did not see a reason to "stream line" Brass and create Age of Industry.  Now that I've played AoI I still don't.  Played with 3 experienced Brass players and 1 newbie and it still took almost as much time to play.

Age of Industry gets rid of some of the best parts of Brass like two (Canal & Rail) periods which is a very strategic element, Income track, loan system which was integrated into the income track (which is no longer) replaced with loan markers, no direct victory points for rail links makes building those less important.  Even careful planning of how much to spend on a given turn to control next round turn order which can be very important in Brass seems relatively unimportant in AoI.  Even the distant cotton market demand is gone (well kind of).

And the industry tiles don't have anything on them but how many VP's they are worth so the player mats are required as needs to be referenced every time you build a tile, and every time one gets flipped on the board (ie. cost in money and coal/iron, income when flipped, how many coal/iron cubes to place on it).  Oh yea, and that's another thing that's gone from Brass... you now get victory points for every tile you built (and not built over which now seems less likely except by yourself) even if you don't get it flipped.

And lastly Brass had a fixed number of rounds so you knew when it was going to end, could use that to plan.  AoI is much more variable as draw stack needs to be depleted *and* someone needs to have an empty hand size.  And now you no longer use a card for every action, you now mainly discard only when building a tile.  In fact a new action is to draw 2 more cards!

Age of Industry is "ok", rating may go up a little after a couple more plays, but not only is AoI not Brass, it's no where near as fun to play as Brass :(

Age of Industry loses a bit of the depth and charm of Brass in the conversion, but makes up for it with simpler and more streamlined rules and a shorter playing time. My main criticism after a couple of games is that AoI reduces the difference between different kinds of industries. In particular, coal and iron were two very different industries in Brass, but here they act almost the same.

The new sequence of play (including the card drawing mechanism) and the victory conditions seem well designed.

Germany and US maps feel very different, which bodes well for the longevity of the system (if it means that any new maps coming out will manage to feel different too).

Initial Rating: 7.5 (March 2012)

As I love Brass, I was very keen to try Age of Industry. After I played it, I can say it is a good game, however there is no reason whatsoever to play this over Brass. The original game is much more tense and interesting and I miss a lot of aspects Wallace retired from Brass. AoI is more forgiving and simple. The only advantage I see AoI has over Brass are the expandability in the form of additional maps. 

This is a good game, but Brass is better in every aspect, so I don’t think I will be playing this a lot. Perhaps this can be the point of entrance for new players, but if you want the real deal go play Brass instead.

Current Rating:6.0

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's not much offensive about Age of Industry, and plenty to like.  Most of what's to like is also found in Brass.

I don't think AoI is especially lighter than Brass, but it is shorter.

Where the game falls short is that it's slower.  Making card replenishment an action instead of an automatic should provide another axis along which to base tactical decisions - when to stock up on cards and how close to the end to burn out the hand before replenishment being the key decisions here.  I just find that it reduces the scope for big moves.  Every few turns I have to stop to refill my hand, which means fewer turns are actually interesting.

I'm not motivated to own this but I wouldn't mind playing a few more times.

I played this first, and thought it was interesting. Now having finally played Brass, I can see why some people prefer the original.  AoI is much more forgiving, you can basically do what you want, so there are a ton of options.  Brass is more restricted, mostly because taking a loan requires an action, and everything is a bit tighter with a few more idiosyncrasies.

This game really gripped me. very good economic game of startup capitalism. Tight and exciting all the way.

First off, is it apt to compare this game with Brass? It seems that many liken this to an Age of Steam/Steam redesign, but I don't think that glove fits. Those games are similar enough that similar strategies can work for each (one is simply looser than the other), but you will fail in Age of Industry if you attempt to apply a Brass strategy and likewise you will fail in Brass playing like it is AoI.

This game puts a greater focus than Brass on timing, placement and expenses (as opposed to managing/planning actions, development, and income). In Age of Industry, money dries up fast and you are almost always paying interest on loans. It's not a lot each turn, but it adds up throughout the game. I hear players say that they don't like that you can take a loan, flip tiles on the same turn and not pay interest. They speak as if they manage this on almost every turn, but in my experience this only happens a few times in a game. Money plays a big roll in point totals. While you don't need to flip for points, you do pick up more money if you flip and it is through flipping that you slowly build profit throughout the game.

Brass is about using money to flip tiles.
AoI is about flipping tiles to make money.

This could easily become a franchise. The two maps provided with the game play quite differently. I definitely see the potential for expansion maps to mix up building requirements, financing, the role of ships and "manufacturing" into a range of impressive game variations that alter strategies and tensions, and are specific to the times and areas they depict.

Expected more from this game. Miss the cut-throat sensation you get from playing Brass. Surely this is not Brass redesigned, this is a completly different game. Less strategical than Brass, more of tactical responses to the board with whatever card suitable or just spending 2 actions in one to get the advantage in that moment.
Don't feel that the cards work better than in Brass. Ridiculous tie breaker!!! Good job streamlining Brass, too damn streamlined for my taste.

Brass is a bold, creative, complex, lumbering, quirky, theme-driven design that probably came together much better than Wallace expected it to. It's an adventurous, thoroughly engaging game with personality and depth. 

Age of Industry surgically removes most of that personality. It's flat. There's nothing to immerse yourself in, just some tiles with investment/profit differentials and a standard loan mechanism. It reminds me of Railroad Tycoon more than anything else. It's like a foundation with no house on it, the gaming equivalent of a Potemkin Village. 

It may sound like I have strong feelings about AoI, but in reality it barely elicits any response from me at all. This game wasn't made for Brass fans. This game was made for people intrigued by the idea of Brass, people who admire Brass from a distance.  I am not one of those people.

It's too long ago since I have played Brass to make a judgment on the AoI vs. Brass controversy. But I don't have the feeling that AoI is an inferior version of Brass. It's streamlined which is something Wallace games are usually in need of. The depth to complexity ratio works out with Brass being both deeper and more complex. It's a bit sad though to see the gamer community split on another Wallace game again as both games will suffer in the plays they'll get. In the long run the variability of the maps might be an argument for AoI to catch up to Brass. As it is, I enjoyed my play as much as I enjoy its predecessor.

I feel like this has been said a million times before, and much more eloquently.  Age of Industry takes the Brass system and strips out the challenge and fun.  I know that a lot of AoI defenders argue that these games should be approached on their own terms as separate game systems, but it is impossible for me to truly separate them in my mind. 

Railroad Tycoon took away the loan pressure from Age of Steam but still left enough to be satisfying, but there are so many things that annoy me about Age of Industry.  I really dislike how all the different tracks are streamlined in such a way that they are more or less interchangeable.  I also dislike the changes in how income worked.  Loans are a necessity in Brass, but they must be done with care to make sure the timing is right.  Here they can be assumed without real consequence, which just doesn't feel right.

The biggest problem with Age of Industry is that, for all its simplifications, it doesn't bring the play time down at all or reduce the rules teaching burden to new players.  While I can appreciate the desire to put out new boards and scenarios, I can't see anything like that revitalizing my interest in this system.

Its NOT Brass lite. This game feels like it has the same complexity, only that the theme has been stripped off a little. Its quite hard to learn this game because if you know the Brass rules, this game "overwrites" quite a few of them.

After first play, mixed feelings. Seemed to be less cut-throat than expected from a Wallace's game. When ever someone does something well, other's get some benefit out of it also. Needs more play, to get the proper hang of it to know what it takes to win it. Only the last turns got us a bit paranoid :).

I did enjoy it, so no reason to rate it less. It almost felt like a harmless Euro, but a bit too rules heavy for casual players. One thing I found lacking was theme/story - it played a bit like abstract, buy no idea how to improve it without extra rules and time weight.

Interesting economic game where you invest in infrastructure, get returns when your facilities are "used up", and go on to build better ones. You can benefit from anticipating and meeting the needs of other players, but there are some restrictions to exactly what you can do and how much cooperation you can squeeze out of your opponents. Also seems like the kind of game where you need half a dozen games under your belt to know what the heck you just did, whether you won or lost. See my comment for Brass for additional notes.

Played twice, 5 players.  No matter how hard I tried, I could not stop comparing this game to Brass.  This is more streamlined (i.e. less fiddly), but I still prefer Brass.  There are 2 huge advantages this has over Brass though; more players, and additional maps.  And there is nothing wrong with this game at all; it is more tactical than Brass, but there's still plenty of management of money and resources.

Streamlined version Brass which doesn't have lots to envy the original (despite what purist hardcores will tell your).  I actually like the drawing cards as an action change and the smoother, unified rules are much easier to teach and have less exception.  The variable boards really change play and give each variant a unique flavor.  If you have Brass, you don't need this, if you don't have Brass, this is a worthy replacement despite being ranked lower.  For new player, I put this on the table, for the old crowd, we still do either.

I really don't want to cmopare this to Brass.  It is a very different game in how it plays.

Welcome to a world that is a more straight forward, simpler, Brass.

The choices are simpler. That makes the game tighter. 

The choices are still not obvious. That makes it an equally challenging, yet fairly different experience.

I'm curious as to how this will play with 5. If it delivers with 5 like it did with 3 then this is my  go-to Brass for 5. I'm fairly certain that with a more hardcore group, and of course 3-4 players, I would still prefer the more harsh and unforgiving original formula.

First play was with 3, second with 4. It seems the more the merrier, however I still have to play with 5. 

Further, I have now played with both sides of the board and found both wonderfully different and worthwhile. I think the German side is more like Brass sans ships while the New England side is more game changing, especially with respect to coal.

People have stated that rails are less important. I whole heartedly disagree.

This game went along slowly. I really want to play another game.  I did not pick it up right away as it's been a long time since I played Brass and they are similar. After two plays I think junior is very good but just a shade behind senior. Three plays and I've lost every one and I still like this game. It has too be a good game if you lose all the time and still like it.

Plays like Brass but in a much more stream-lined way.  Brass is a truly interesting and elegant game but is immensely complex for new players to learn as the rules switch midway through the game.  Age of Industry simplifies the game but keeps the same feel.  I do like this game a great deal and the fact you can play new maps adds to the experience.  It is not as good as Brass but is a sound system and is much more approachable than Brass.  The game is a middleweight to heavy euro.

A less annoying version of Brass. I don't know if it's better but it's definitely not as heavy and it still requires you to make long term plans. Much less likelihood of getting boned on cards. I expect my favorite between the two will be whichever one I have played most recently.

As it states, this is a streamline of Brass. Brass is an excellent game, but I think this one is just a bit better. In Brass, I was always disappointed to leave the canal phase, and this does not have a canal phase, which seems to make it flow better. The addition of extra maps makes it more interesting too.

Probably my favorite economic game. It's bit too heavy for my usual tastes, but at least slightly lighter and more intuitive than Brass. It's very thematic game where you build your own industry and the railroads for it. With hardcore gamers this game would probably suck because you can really go overboard with blocking and optimization calculations, but when played with other casual gamers I've always enjoyed it.

2-Player Comment:
* Play with unofficial 2p variant, which is very simple - remove one of each card type (one of each colour, one of each industry). Otherwise follow normal rules. It works for all the maps. I think Age of Industry is great 2p game. Map expansions 2 & 3 have 2p maps.

Expansions:
+Age of Industry Expansion #1: Japan and Minnesota
+Age of Industry Expansion #2: Belgium & USSR
+Age of Industry Expansion #3: Great Lakes & South Africa

The main reason for replacing perfect "Brass" with "Age of Industry" might be the information that it is also for two players. But the game doesn't work for 2 players and this makes me come back to better "Brass".

RATING: 7.5
After two plays this is shaping up to be quite interesting. Possibly play once more on the 'easy' Europe board before trying the 'harder' US board. Definitely needs some more regular play to really get to grips with the game.

Play three: forgot that Ports allow access to Distant Markets and that the game ends when the deck and one person's hand are empty (as opposed to just the deck). Really need to play the Minnesota map ASAP

Played the Minnesota map now after a long break - took a while to get back into the game itself, let alone figuring out the new Markets and the dynamics of Coal and Iron production. The winner was the person that started the Game with brown cards in their hand and so were able to generate income early.

It is what it intends to be: a stripped down version of Brass. It is still a good game, but by far not as interesting and challenging as Brass. The rule changes are quite significant. 
-Developing doesn't seem to be very interesting anymore unless it is necessary in order to place a first building;
-There is less room for handmanagement as fewer actions require a card. So there is less room for planning and choosing your strategy: you have to do it with the cards you're getting, you can't dump the cards you don't want as easily anymore or it would cost you an unproductive action. That takes away most of the spice and brilliance of Brass.
-Railbuilding is only a necessity to get somewhere, but it is not an interesting way to score points anymore.
- The buildings are too much alike. They don't offer you are different mix of points versus income like in Brass. So again, there is less room for strategy, also in this respect.

Martin Wallace's games polarise me. I LOVE Automobile and Rise of Empires; but Age of Industry, whilst it has some good stuff about it, is one of those games that I just don't seem to 'get'. For me, it's too much like work. There's very little fun in this financial manipulation engine, and games should be all about the fun. There are many economic games which I find preferable to this one, which is a shame as I always want to like Martin's stuff.

A nice development of Brass.  Lacks some of the specific flavor, but allows play on a variety of maps.  The Germany map is extremely boring to look at.  Game play is tight and challenging.  We realized we were way too stingy, and could easily have taken out a slew of loans and done ok.  Played 2-player, each taking 2 colors and scoring the worse and finished in 2.25 hours, so not too bad for play time.

I think streamlining Brass was a great idea.  The game plays faster, there's more you can do with the cards and best of all it's designed with an eye towards multiple maps.  The different maps can really change the game (probably even more than the subtle changes we see with the different Power Grid maps).  I'm not sure if it's necessarily better than Brass but it's probably a game I'll end up playing more often and it's certainly more accessible to new gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Only read the rules (multiple times, including rules clarifications on the forums) but strikes me as a more interesting, dynamic, and less rigid/scripted Power Grid.

*update* Played once (4player, New England map). The other three were not too enthusiastic, probably due to my bungling of a rules explanation. However, despite their sourpuss moods, I fully enjoyed it. This says something about a game where its enjoyability is independent of a good group ambience. By the end of the game, two of the others in the session were looking forward to our next game. I'm a fan and will rate this when I know it better.

*update 2* Still only played it once, but I was wrong. Two of the 3 I played it with enjoyed it, only one didn't. One guy spent the whole game trying to figure out how it comes together and the other guy was feeling sick so not totally into it. Both told me later that on reflection, it really is a good game and they want to play it again

*update 3* Played it twice (with a completely new group). Amazingly fun game. I need to explore this more and delve into the expansions.

An excellent economic game, with lots of space to direct and indirect confrontation, which is become rarer on heavy Euros.

"I think without having played Brass, I would have felt Age of Industry to be a good game (and still is a good game)-- not hall-of-fame great, but worth playing once in a while. Having played Brass, I don't really see a particular situation where I would prefer Age of Industry -- except maybe to introduce novice players to the ecnomic genre, at most?"

As a major Brass fan, I felt a need to give this a try, though I had already decided, based on what I heard, that I wouldn't like it as much. I think if I had to choose only one, I would indeed go with Brass but I definitely enjoyed AoI.

It was difficult to approach AoI without using Brass strategies. It may take several more plays to shake that and play it as its own game. The variety in maps and setup will make that enjoyable and I do look forward to playing it more. It doesn't feel like quite the perfectly-designed puzzle that Brass does, but it feels good.

Ten plays in, I'm enjoying this more and more. It is not Brass the System. It is not Brass. It is its own beast and I enjoy it quite a bit. Love mixing up the different maps.

After playing this and Brass several times each, I found I prefered this, ...although Brass is still very good. 

The gameplay is fairly deep, has descent theme for a Eurostyle strategy game, and does not seem to suffer from down time.  The aftermarket mapboards, available from BGG, expand the game greatly by offering additional multiplayer maps as well as some excellent two player maps.  On these maps AoI is a magnificant 2 plyr game.

RATING: 8
Despite what some people may claim, this is NOT Brass-lite. When I actually played the game I realised that, in fact, it was an improvement on Brass. Here's why: the game board is double sided, which gives you twice the replayability, it is designed to have expansion boards added to the base game, it has removed the quirky and irritating rules (virtual Birkenhead link, and movement of iron), hand-management is a much more important aspect of play (cards are only played for certain actions and you can draw from either the face-down deck or the two available face-up cards to replenish your hand as an action), the game is variable in length rather than pre-set by the card draws, there is a new industry (manufacturing), the external markets for cotton and manufactured goods are now determined randomly at game start so that each game has a different aspect regarding shipping, shipyards counters now represent actual ships and they have a purpose (transport coal and allow goods to be shipped to external markets), building of railways is tougher (now require $1 payment, 1 coal and 1 iron), there is no victory point/income track manipulation, you have to manage your money more effectively (taking an excessive number of loans can cripple you) and there is a player mat to display your tiles which provides you with useful game info. Don't listen to people who've only read the rulebook - this is a great game and destined to become a classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
I think this may replace Brass for me. The rules are less fiddly and it has been easier to teach, to grasp and to remember so far. The variety in the maps is also a big deal for me. The income track is gone, and the lack of location names on the cards hurts the theme a little bit, but you still have to generate income frequently by flipping your tiles, there are loans with interest, there is still a strong spatial aspect to the game as well as the blurred lines between cooperation and competition.

Regarding the obligatory comparison with Brass, I too have had my fits of revulsion, shocked at how Age of Industry is lacking x, y, and z. But really, it just handles itself differently and requires a different approach. I consider the differences between industries to be artifacts of the map; one look at the Minnesota map should dismiss all notions that Coal and Iron are "the same." The Canal Era is also essentially a variant rule; check out the card drafting mechanism on the Japan map for another radical take on how this system can be played. Other "lackings" just need fresh thinking: actions that were anathema in Brass are now viable and vice versa.

Age of Industry [i]seems[/i] looser, which makes it easier for new players to get into it. But in actual execution, it is in some ways more difficult. There aren't as many boundaries, so it's not as clear when you've made a losing move. For example, you'll never run out of money, which can happen in Brass and is a surefire sign you're going to lose. However, in Age of Industry, you could be sitting on Loans a little too long, paying interest every round, not really realizing here too you've lost the game, albeit in a slower, quieter way.

Regardless of the differences, one thing is the same: a solid and well-executed strategy is paramount; players who focus on industries that others don't invest in will beat those who don't. Making that happen is easier said than done and is the real challenge both here and in Brass.

My main problem with Age of Industry at this point is that it seems to drag on toward the end, as players add Rail Links for a dollar here, a couple dollars there. The end result is an extra couple rounds amounting to everyone gaining 1 VP. If this keeps happening, perhaps I'll just pull half the Rail Links from the game. That'll show 'em!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoy but I think I prefer Brass.  I don't think that the simplifications actually shorten or streamline the game that much, they just make it possible to play it on different maps which is not nothing.  Playing "almost" Brass is good enough for me, because I like the core system so much.  

I would like to play this a lot more, now that I have several of the expansion maps, but I haven't had much luck getting it to the table.  I especially want to try U.S.S.R. and South Africa.  But maybe if I can twist the arm of just one other I can get some of the 2-player maps played.

I wish the loans were different - there's no reason ever to not pay off a loan instantly if you can, because there is no cost to take out the same loan and get your money back. This makes me wish that it could be handled without the passing back and forth of the money.. you could manually do that by not paying the interest on loans that you could have paid off (e.g. if you had 2 loans and 13 money then you would just pay 1 during that step).

The railroads were more powerful than I expected. Each railroad segment counts all the industry in the cities in connects, so you can count a single city multiple times if you have multiple railroads connecting them. This makes boston very valuable for railroads! (Maybe I shouldn't have started in the brown area of the board farthest from boston..

Money is tight in this game and to build your industrial empire you need to make xtensive use of loans. Once you have mastered the rules the game plays reasonably quickly but overstays its welcome due to the restricted choices of available actions towards the end of the game.

a great economy game, expandable with different maps, but somehow prone to AP and can drag the game too long.

Rating after one play with 4 players on the England map. 3 of us played Brass before (it's inevitable to compare to Brass).

The streamlined rules are an improvement, but make no mistake, this is not Brass-Lite, it's a great strategy game on its own. It feels more economic than Brass, there's no income at the beginning of each round as in Brass, money is tighter IMO (but that could be the England map where coal is scarce).

In Brass you want to flip counters to gain points, in AoI you flip them to get income. This makes for a very different game.
 
Looking forward to playing again! Next time I'd like to play the Japan map with 3 players.

component wise everything is fine, same quality as Brass, although I find the region cards pretty ugly..

This is the streamlined version of Brass, that does away with some of the clunkiness of the original game.  There is no longer a canal phase and a railway phase. You get two actions per turn, either to build rails, construct a building or draw 2 cards. 

It's a hard game fo rme to analyze. I think there is a advantage in going first, yet how the turn order changes with the person who spent the most going last, makes it harder for some buildings to be constructed as you go last in the next phase. This seems a bit unfair to me. Still, I'd like to get my skill level up, trying basic strategies trying to earn money through the coal market, or selling lots of cotton, which I have not had a chance to try.

Hmmm... Really not sure about this one. Haven't played Brass yet, so I can't compare, but on first play it just didn't seem as much fun or as addictive as Steam, Tinners' Trail or Princes of the Renaissance.

It was a bit hard to keep track of your own rail lines, but we played with the wooden trains - the cardboard rails may be easier to see.

Our first game took almost three hours. That will quicken presumably, but perhaps not by a great deal. Scoring is a bit fiddly.

One play, 'more advanced' new  england map. Brass in plain clothes. Many ideas remain, but it is substantially redeveloped. The VP and money track is gone. Not all actions require cards to be played. Development is an action that does, but it does not require iron any more, 1 development needs 1 card to be played. Getting cards on the other hand is an action. Loans are not considered an action any more, they can be taken and repaid any time (10% interest is paid at the end of the turn) and the function of tile flipping now is that it only provides instant money. There is no steady income in this game. Any tile that is built worth VPs equal to its tech level at the end regardless of flipping. Both coal and iron are shipped through connections. There is no canal phase any more, only a rail phase and rail connections only provide money at the end, 5 coins worth 1 VP. There is a new industrial tile symbolized by a box, the function of which is very similar to cotton mills, it just provides an alternative. Ships can only be built where ports are already built. Ships only flip when a distant market tile associated with the ship is flipped and coal that is provided with the ship is also shipped.
The feel of the game is similar to Brass, but requires different thinking. Here is an example: there is competition to flip cotton mills and ports in Brass, but in Age of Industry there was a situation where a distant market cotton demand tile was not flipped at all because one player built and flipped all of his cotton mills already, so he could not flip it and it was not in the interest of the other players to flip it, because it would have flipped a ship, and that would have provided money to the player who could not flip it. I prefer Brass. I think Age of Industry is a shorter game (2-3 hours vs 3-4 for Brass), but more restrictive towards the players and ultimately a weaker game.

This game is a gem and I absolutely love playing it. Most games that are 2+ hours generally have those moments were you just wish the game would speed up or just end all together. This never happens with this game and I can say this the fastest feeling 2 hour game I have ever played. The turn order is extremely fast and it is even entertaining to watch other players execute their turns. This is a very honest no frills game that is very competitive and very strategic. This is a must have game.

We all enjoyed ourselves very much and loved the game.

Once explained, the gameplay was very dynamic, we didn't need to check the rules again and everything flet very natural. We completed our first game in just a couple of hours. 

The manual is not great (not bad either), it could have been explained in less than half of the space.

The aesthetics is quite lacking. It's not really ugly, it's just... functional.

I really like Brass so I wasn't sure how AoI compares to it. On the other hand possibility of expansions sounds very good but on the other hand it has streamlined some parts of Brass I like (mainly 2 phases). It was better than in my worst fears but I still like Brass more. Expansions with rules / map modified are nice though and AoI also works more/less than 4 players.

It took a few plays before I started really enjoying Brass. This is a very similar game and after one play I'm impressed, but yet to decide whether it lives up to Brass. The double sided map and the promise of more maps is the big selling point - but I have this nagging doubt that in order to make it expandable this 'version' has removed some of the personality from the orginal game.

It's the same Brass system, so you get the same decision-intense feeling, the same need to consider your investment strategy wisely, the same race-tension to get your counters onto the board before others. But it is more streamlined - once through the cards thereby getting rid of the canal phase and subsequent cleanout, loans are as you need them (rather than the gamey requirement to take an action), it takes an action to draw cards now, selling to offshore markets is replaced with selling via ships in order to flip them, eliminates Birkenhead type quirks, etc. You still need to develop, you still need to source iron and coal, you still need to build rail networks. The big wins over Brass are handling 5 players plus being able to play on different maps, with each map driving the importance of some elements up and others down, providing for different drivers to mix up your strategies. A really nice development direction for the Brass system and I'm not sure I'll go back to the original again.

Very good game and I do prefer it to Brass. The reason for that is the clarity of focus of the design (Brass just struck me as a game that was trying to do too many things at the same time) and the length of time it takes to complete a game. These two factors mean that this one will hit the table a lot more than Brass will.

I really did appreciate the rules streamlining in Age of Industry from Brass; unlike Brass, I feel I can actually teach this game without messing anything up.  It really is a big plus for me.  However, I think that the new debt system makes the game too easy; because paying off debt is as easy as taking it on, I essentially felt like I had an infinite amount of money during my turns.  This took a lot of the tension of the the game for me.  Kind of like Age of Steam and Steam, I wish I could combine the the two rulesets into the perfect game.

It is very much like Brass & I would not recommend owning both.  I think it is significantly improved from the original.  It still has a lot of quirks, but is definitely streamlined.  Although it is still a difficult game, I feel safer teaching this one to newbies.  The region color cards are a much better implementation than the city cards of Brass.  I like that one has to actively use an action to draw cards.  The loans are more sensible.  Not having 2 ages & always scoring the builds are also good improvements.

I see no need to get the "deluxe" edition with the bonus wood bits.

Another Martin Wallace classic. Quite like Brass. All about economic engines and efficiency and finding the right moment to strike that non-combat style blow against your opponents.

Martin Wallace just kicks major butt as a designer. Took all I love about Brass and then refined the system in a way that makes play just that much smoother, not to mention allows playing on expansion maps a breeze. Such a good game. Feeling it's likely a nine, but perhaps higher...will decide after some more plays. Would love to see this become an app!

I was interested but apprehensive to play as Brass is one of my all-time favourites. Having read the rules, I didn’t like a lot of the changes that had been made from Brass and my first play seemed to confirm this. I missed the income track and the loan decisions, the differentiation of the industries, the canal era. But then a strange thing happened: at my next game night I wanted to play again, and then at the one after that too. I began to appreciate AoI’s plus points rather than just comparing it to Brass. While it isn’t much shorter or much less complex in its rules than Brass, it does feel lighter to play. The decisions are more tactical and I don’t feel burned out on finishing a game. I can definitely see it working better for new players than Brass does, particularly as the rules are much better written. And playing both sides of the board confirmed that one of AoI’s main advantages is its expandability. I like that it will be possible to tinker with how the industries work as well as the geography - it reminds me of the Power Grid expansions, some of which are quite radical.

UPDATE: swiftly lost interest, while I still play Brass regularly. All the changes were for the worse really.

An excellent game.  Very different to Brass (and yet also very similar!) and the game play is just as deep with plenty of different choices to make on every turn.

On the Europe map, a 3-player game was better than a 2-player game.  Struggled with a 3-player game on the US map: need to see how this map goes another time.

Brass with all the annoying little wrinkles ironed out. Whilst playing you are presented with all the same fun decisions that Brass gives you, but with less rules exceptions to worry about.

To make this game really shine you need to add in the expansion - bringing it up to Brass complexity.

One of my favorite heavy, gamer games.  Unlike other economic games where you are trying to build up an industry, here you are inserting your industries into the economic infrastructure of the country.

The two player game needs to be altered, probably by reducing the number of cards available.  I think this game would be better with more people (the more the merrier!).

As others have said, this is "Brass Lite," but not *too* lite. It is simpler than Brass (a game I greatly enjoy) but is still a very meaty eurogame.

Some of the changes are clearly designed to turn Brass into an expandable game. The industry chits no longer list details such as price or the amounts of coal and iron required or produced; instead these appear on nicely laid-out player mats. This allows different expansions to change those parameters simply by including new player mats. The game comes with a double-sided board, offering two different "expansions" right out of the box.

Also I like that the game is listed as playable by two players—although I haven't yet tried it with two, so I don't know what that's like. Brass makes a good two-player game if you reduce the board size, so I'm hopeful that AoI will make a good two-player game. If so, and if designer Martin Wallace follows through on his promise to release a series of expansions, Age of Industry could become a very nice line.

Good game that is interesting and quite deep. One always has to keep in mind the strategy of end scoring while tactically dealing with the actions in order to generate a functional money machine each turn so not to drive yourself deep in debt.  Additionally, one has to balance the limited amount or railroads as it's not apparent from the start that you are not going to have enough to do everything you would like.  

On the negative, there is some heavy analysis paralysis which can drag the game out especially with bad luck of the draw.  Sometimes you can run out of things to do towards the end and you just end up discarding cards to end the game. The theme is a bit thin and i wish I felt I was actually building something but the mechanics are great.

Brass but with less fiddly elements. Players spend money, which they use to build railways and various sorts of industries. Industries provide goods, or markets for goods, or the raw materials to build industries. Effectively each industry is a speculation, you pay for it. If (usually when) it delivers (goods are shipped, or it provides a market, or its raw materials are used) you get a return. The idea is to assemble as much cash and as many advanced industries by the end of the game as possible.
It is not particularly demanding in terms of rules to learn but the game does snowball (more money = more ability to invest) which can be frustrating for newer players.

I have a relatively interesting history with this game, considering I've only ever played it twice. The first of those plays was way back in 2011 (in about November or December, iirc), not that long after I first got into modern boardgames. However, at that stage I mainly preferred lighter games (not so much gateways like Settlers and Carcassonne, but definitely games with simple rules - card games tended to be my favourites, especially Dominion and Race for the Galaxy, both of which I still love), so I was not remotely ready for this relatively complex Wallace creation, especially as the 2 players teaching it to me did a generally bad job of it, and we even played on the Japan map which I subsequently learned was not at all recommended for beginners. Needless to say, I did not enjoy this experience.

Fast forward to May of 2012, and my wife decided to actually buy this at the UK Games Expo which we both attended - I did not really know why (I know she played it once, but don't recall if it was before or after buying our copy), especially as it then sat unplayed on our game shelves for a few years. Meanwhile, as I got much more experience of modern games (and learned to love many pretty complex games, these days it's almost true that the more complex the rules the more I will enjoy a game!), I discovered that Martin Wallace is a designer that I really don't get on with (I don't hate many of his games, but there are very few I'd choose to play, London is easily my favourite but even that is not one I'd ever specifically request). Meanwhile I played Brass once, on which I know this game is heavily based - and actually found it a decent enough game (although nothing special and not remotely deserving of its incredibly high BGG rating).

Anyway, finally in February 2015 my wife decided she wanted to get this one out and give it a go at our regular game night at our house (just 3 of us on this occasion, although often it's 4). I didn't expect to love it, but was not unhappy to give it another try. We played on the "beginner's" Germany map as well - but I did not enjoy it at all. My wife said it was supposed to be a "streamlined" version of Brass, but comparing that experience with what I remember of my one game of Brass, Wallace totally failed in his aim - this was so much clunkier than Brass's simple "play 1 card to take an action" (twice per turn) mechanic. Not to mention the loss of the VP/income track with everything now done with tokens. (I don't mind the collapsing of the "canal" and "rail" periods into one, although I don't see it as a huge gain either.) I can see why allowing the game to be played on a variety of maps is an improvement, but this just felt disjointed. I'd much rather play Brass again than this, on any map.

This is the base game that came out second. I have played both this and Brass and with its more generic ruleset and straightforward play it feels like the first game of the series. Brass with its more specialized rules feels like an expansion map along side Japan and Minnesota. If you think that vanilla versions of boardgames are boring once you've added in the extra expansion rules and quirks you may not like Age of Industry but I think both it and Brass and Japan/Minnesota have their places.

In many ways this game is more streamlined than Brass and it definitely plays faster. I like the flexibility of the region cards over specific city cards, and the relaxed limitation of what has to be built in each square on the board. Loans seem almost too easy in this game, though it relaxes some of the AP in Brass that came from having to plot out precisely how much money you need for many turns in advance. The tension of flipping industries is still present, since it is virtually the only way of getting money, even though they score whether they are flipped or not.

The industries in Age of Industry have had two changes to them from the original. The first is that they have more consistency in how they function. It's much easier to explain them in general terms instead of going into details on each of them individually.

I miss some of the more interesting differences in the character of the industries, though. While I like that there is more consistency in how they "function," I don't like that they are nearly interchangeable now. There aren't many tough choices to make on what to build. For instance, coal and iron are basically the same thing now while in Brass: coal = money while iron = victory points. There was a meaningful choice in whether to build one or the other. It doesn't matter in AoI, you get identical profits and victory points from both coal and iron.

I like the difference in the feel of both sides of the map. On one side, there are no ships, and on the other there are lots of ships but only two locations to build coal. They each have a distinct flavor to the way they play. I'd like to see a more neutral map, though, where there is a better balance between ships and coal locations.

I very much prefer Brass over AoI. AoI is not that bad, but I am rating it low because I don't see any aspects where it is an improvement over Brass. And I think it's a little harder to teach to new players than Brass, since with Brass, you can tell players to focus on improving their position on the income track, whereas in AoI it's harder for new players to figure out how to best make money.

A shorter version of Brass, masterpiece of Martin Wallace. The players have to manage their production route and make money out of money. This is a game where players play with negative asset most of the time. They start the game with zero coin, take a loan to pay for the buildings, and maybe take another loan to repay the previous loan. What a burden.

It is both brass light and a unique game.
It has many elements of Brass and shares some strategy but the different layout and rules make the game play surprising different.  I don't plan to buy it as I prefer brass but I can see the appeal.

Not as tight as Brass and plays quite differently, even if several of the core elements are the same. I miss the income subtlety of Brass - taking out loans whenever you feel you need for cash is a real game changer in terms of tension and planning. It also adds even more fiddling to the mix. There's a whole host of other changes - like the two cards open selection, one continuous age, predictable markets, fewer technology steps - that makes it feel less, and like less is less, rather than a less is more. 

The industries feel too similar compared to Brass - there's not much difference between a factory and a cotton mill, or coal and iron, in terms of points and income. You can even build over a cotton mill with a factory. I really prefer the big difference in victory point and income values in Brass, especially with the shipyards.

The good stuff, in fact the only significant positive I can get out of AoI is the variable maps, which will keep the game interesting if played often. It also plays with five, but I'm not sure I'd want to go there.

I prefer Brass, but who knows, with the new maps and this being the newer game, Age of Industry might be the one I bring to the table more often.

German map house variant for two players: Both must start in The Ruhr, and remove Shipyard, Southern German cards (brown) and one of each industry card. No building/railways in Southern Germany.

The first reading of the rulebook left me in expectation of a quite complex game. Actually, it flows quite smoothly once the placement constraint are assimilated.

After a couple of plays, I am not impressed though. I suppose 2-player is not the best configuration. I hope I will be able to play it with more players and update my opinion...

Brass light?  No, Brass better.  Just one age,with cards for areas instead of individual cities, so players have more flexibility.  You still build your connections and industry, still ship to ports and markets, still take loans, but with the adjusted rules, it plays faster than Brass but is at least (if not more) enjoyable.  Given the choice, I would pick this over Brass every time.

To call this Brass-lite is a bit unfair.  They are clearly siblings, but this has a different sort of flow.  It's slightly more forgiving, but that's like saying that being hit by a car is less painful than being hit by a truck.

Sesudo y tenso, tras las dos/tres horas de juego te deja realmente fatigado, sobre todo en partidas con 4 o 5 jugadores, donde tienes que estar a todo lo que hacen los demás.

RATING: 10
Wow.  This game is excellent.  Lots of decisions as well as flexibility to change your plans on the fly.  Cards drive where or what you can build and there is also some conflict in that you can overbuild your opponents coal mines and iron works.  If you like Wallace at all, this is definitely one you need to get.  It's a solid 9 and I can see it shooting up to a 10 and a permanent place in my top 5.

Jumps into the top 3, displacing one of my long-time top 3 games, World Without End.

AoI is now officially a 10 for me.  Sure, there are some wonky rules, but any game where you have lots more choices than available actions on a consistent basis is the sign of a great game.

Lots of strategies and decisions. All the building actions connects with one another in an organic way throughout the play. The map evolves beautifully, almost telling a history. The economy is balanced even with the players going for very different strategies. 

The game hits the perfect spot in his simplicity of rules and is easy get people into.

I have not played Brass, but I like Age of Industry quite a bit. As usual with most middle-weight games, I was lost the beginning trying to figure out the flow of the game and how money is earned. Thankfully, the game is quite forgiving, and it is interesting how the game is cooperative and competitive at the same time. The 2 hours or so I spent playing each game doesn't feel all that long, which is always a good sign.

Így játék előtt annyit róla, hogy a belső tartalom csillagos ötös. Vastag, szép tokenek, amiket nagyon jól ki lehetett nyomni. Kettővel több zacskó a dobozban, mint ami az alkatrészeknek kell, ezt a legtöbb kiadó szépen kihagyja a játékaiból. Szóval le a kalappal eddig.

Sajnos már nem emlékszem a Brassal való játékomra így nem igazán tudom összehasonlítani, de nem éreztem könnyebbnek az biztos. Nagyon kemény gazdasági szimuláció, amit a kártyák tesznek irányítottá. Ez a mechanizmus nagyon tetszik. Meg kell próbálnod a kártyák alapján a legjobb döntést meghozni, hogy hol építed föl a gyáraidat és a vasúthálózatod hogyan építed ki. Nagyon fontos az időzítés, az áruk eladásánál és építéseknél. Nagyon komoly játék, ami nagyon jól van optimalizálva, mert nagyon kis nüanszok döntöttek az első játék alkalmával. Nekem nagyon tetszett.

Really a solid game. I'm not so sure that it's a lot faster than Brass, but I will say that it shares its depth. The rules are less fiddly, which is a plus.

Decent, but Brass this ain't. I'll pick Brass over this game every time, unless there are 5 players.

Update: I'm softening my stance on this game since the release of the Japan/Minn expansion. I still enjoy Brass more than AoI, but I'd rather play AoI over many other games out there, especially now that the expansion is out. The rules are also a bit easier to teach to newcomers than the Brass rules.

Update: Exploding with new gameplay possibilities with the release of the Great Lakes, South Africa, Belgium, and Soviet Union maps in the BGG Store :)

In the same family (of two!) as Brass, but not Brass Light. Rather, Brass Different. Yes, there is a lot of streamlining -- no canal phase, simpler loan management, more flexible cards (drawing and using), more consistent building rules, simpler VP scoring, etc. -- but these, and the other changes -- new industry type, different values values, etc. -- make the game feel more than just a little different. Unfortunately, my games have not really been much faster than Brass. Of course, every game I've played has included new players ....

Definitely worth trying!

--- Sea Lane Rules --
1. a sea lane is virtual; it comes into play if a port is built in the connected city. 
2. when using an industry card to build, a sea lane counts as a railway counter belonging to the player(s) with either an industry tile built in one of the locations on either end of the sea lane, or a railway counter connected to one of those locations.
(Think of it as an extension of the port itself.)

---
The second edition rules contain a few modifications and clarifications to the first edition rules. In short they are:
1. You now start the game with six cards each, irrelevant of the number of players
2. Use the sea lane rules described in the Japan section: You can use a sea lane to move coal/iron or sell cotton/manufactured goods in the same way as a rail connection IF there is a constructed port at each end of the sea lane and a constructed ship in between. It does not matter if the counters are flipped or not. A sea lane counts as a rail link that belongs to all players for the purposes of building with industry cards, e.g. one of you ship counters would allow you to use an industry card to build in any connected location, but only if there is a port there or you intend to build a port with your action.
3. The game ends when the deck has been exhausted, even if there are still cards on display

RATING: N/A
Played the German map only. This game was made after Brass so a lot of similar things happen. The thing is that despite all the similarities both games play quite differently. I think Martin Wallace achieved something he wanted to achieve which is designing two similar games based on the same subject but for different audiences and giving players distinct feelings.

I like Brass better. At this point I don't even compare both since I've only played the German map which seems to be the most uninteresting one. I have to play in the US map to grasp the real feeling of the game. Plus, unlike Brass, Age of Industry seems to work a lot better with more players (4/5).

Played again with two players. It's not a perfect game with two players giving some placement dispute problems and also some extra needless turns but still a good experience. I would definitely rate it a 7 with two players which is not a bad rate. I like the tactic timing aspects of the game when playing with two which seem more obvious because there is no chaos element with this format. A good option. 

After playing it with four players, the German map, I really can't rate it isolated from its history/existence. This game was released after Brass and I can't rate it based in innovation, mechanics or anything alike. The most important stuff I see about Age of Industry is its resemblances and differences from Brass and at this point I have to say that I like Brass so much more. First of all this game doesn't solve the time of play "issue". From all the games I've played so far I can't tell that they last shorter than Brass although it doesn't have two periods. Secondly and despite Martin Wallace talked about how he likes this loan option better, I don't. I find it boring and not strategic enough like it is in Brass. One of the key aspects of this game is still the timing of play and the way players can control or not they're positioning in the turn order but I for some reason have the idea that in Brass advantages are more obvious.
I still haven't explored the US map enough (the same with the German map really) and I fell that it's something I have to do before taking my final rating decision.

The main difference between Brass and Age of Industry in my opinion is the one single industry per city. I find this rules very annoying and much more card dependent in some sense. 

After playing the game one more time I down rated it to 7. I like the game obviously and I'll play it more of course but I find it long, a bit boring by the end and a bit static maybe because there are not many building options.

Plus, this game doesn't have anything new. It doesn't have any special new mechanic that I particularly appreciate. But I would recommend it to gamers in a second for sure.

UPDATE
With 2 players I have to rate it a 6. It didn't grab me enough. A lot of other games come first when playing with 2 players only. This means that a new 2 player map is needed Martin!

2 read throughs of the rules have convinced me this is sufficently different from Brass to be worth while. The one era, card draw action and addition of trade goods alone make it quite fifferent.

The production value is superb, the best from Treefrog/warfrog so far. 

After 2 plays the game feels more brutal (and unforgiving if thats possible) than Brass

Prefer the US map, has ships, a more intersting dynamic with coal (makes it different from Iron - unlike Germany map)

"A streamlined version of Brass".  This is true, however it is streamlined to the point of taking all that was good from Brass and eliminating it.  Sure the game is shorter (not by that much), but it lacks the tension of Brass.  I also found that some of the actions were watered down the the point that they lost all interest, i.e. no cost for developing, points earned just for building a tile and not flipping it.  Had I never played Brass before this, I might have a better opinion of it but as it stands I don't really have much interest in playing this again.

Age of Industry was met with much anticipation by many and disdain by a few.  It is significantly more approachable than Brass but lacks the fire of its predecessor.  Martin Wallace tried to distill the greatness of Brass into a package that everyone could enjoy, but it is like taking a marvelous Bordeaux and turning it into a wine cooler.   Fresh and enjoyable; but inevitably pedestrian.

Quite an intriguing design. Graphics are functional and also very appealing to my eye. One of the more difficult euros to learn (ships and sea lanes and ports, oh my), but the game's multi-layers can readily be seen. Even better, the game works perfectly at all those multi-levels without being a brain-burner.

The expandability is a huge plus here (I have all the expansion maps, each which tells its own story). It's nice to have the flexibility to play w/2-5 players.

All-in-all, excellent!

Industrial development and transportation game. 'AoI' is a streamlined version of 'Brass' and obviously shares much of its parent's game's mechanisms and goals. Players have to produce resources, develop factories and transport materials to ports and markets. Points are awarded for developments, which also generate income making future improvements possible. Unlike 'Brass' the game isn't split into two periods, so there is no need to restart your transportation network and factories don't become obsolete after a certain time. There is also no income track, which  simplifies the process of taking out loans. 'AoI' is an intriguing game to play and the gamelpay has a feeling of genuine depth. I would say however that 'Brass' is the superior gaming experience on account of its less forgiving nature and the greater skill required by the player to succeed.

I've mostly played a two-player version of the game.
The two player version goes like this: remove 2 of every industry card, but remove only 1 ship and remove 3 of every colored card. Remove the first 0-vp factory from your tableau.

2 players play it in 60-80 minutes including set-up. This is REALLY nice!

Germany should only really be used as an introduction to the base game. The lack of ships makes it a less-than-interesting map.

The New England Map plays well for 2 although it develops into a ship-building race quite fast. Not bad, just different. 

Japan is a very fun map for 2 players. You can make some CRAZY comebacks using the extended cards display. I've been set to make a 3VP + 68$ trade action as my last game action with the display once, so you really need to keep an eye out for that. The northern part is not as interesting to build on as the southern part, so there is a lot of jostling for position and trying to sneak buildings through the expanded seaways.

Minnesota is yet another great map. It's very different from the other maps. You can sell other players' stuff to certain markets, which is a great, and a very interesting mechanic. 

The fan made expansion maps are now available in the geekstore and I advise anyone interested in a neat economic game for 2 players to try out the Great Lakes map. The turn order mechanic is special, there are certain areas of the board where your industries are worth more money when they are flipped and one quarter of the game harbors and ships are out of reach due to winter season. Your infrastructure needs to be in place to be ready for winter or you will be left with just drawing cards when it's cold outside. There is also a lot of money to be made in railroads and a lot of straight bonus VP to be made from building as many buildings as possible, so ships are not quite as dominant as they are on some of the other maps. The turn order mechanic lets you perform certain timed builds in a more predictable manner than the normal turn mechanic where your expenditure determines the play order.

Considering how differently this game plays depending on the map, you really get a LOT of economic euro with Age of Industry and its expansions.

For 2 players, I recommend playing one of the fan-made 2 player maps (Great Lakes and Belgium) or taking out cards and industry tokens as noted above. For me, Age of Industry hits the exact amount of brain burning I need to have fun with an economic game and not be spent when I'm done.

Highly recommended.

Fantastic game, especially when everyone starts to know what they are doing. There are interesting choices to make once you understand that initiative means EVERYTHING in the game, as you want to be the first one to exploit opportunities on the board (that you or anyone else has generated).

I haven't tried Brass, so I can't compare it personally. But, from what I've been told, this is similar in that it is the cleaner version, much like Steam is to Age of Steam and Conquest of the Empire is to Struggle of Empires. If that's true, then I'll have to say I much prefer Martin Wallace's re-makes. They are much cleaner and straight forward without taking away a lot of the interesting parts.

Age of Industry is an interesting game, and like every Wallace game I've played, takes a couple of plays in order to really grok. At this point, I'm quite happy to own this and would readily play it again.

OK - I'm a little confused. This is billed as a streamlined remake of Brass. Martin Wallace is quoted on the BGG entry page for Age of Industry saying "You can now play something with the depth of Brass but in half the time." And that's what I expected. But my first game of this - played with four players who all had played Brass and were fairly familiar with most of the basic mechanics - took two hours. So then, out of curiosity, I looked at the play time listed for both games: Brass - 120 minutes; Age of Industry - 120 minutes. That hardly seems like much of a time savings to me. Well, regardless, Age of Industry is certainly a bit cleaner and more straightforward than Brass in many respects, and would be easier to teach to a new player. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but now the I've played and realized it's not significantly shorter than Brass I'm wondering if I need to own both games ...

RATING: 8.5
Initially, it was difficult to come up with a strategy since there were so many options. After several turns, the flow of the game became apparent and we were able to strategize much better. Functional components, except not having the return on investment amount on the chits was a bad decision, unless future maps have different values for the various industries. I really enjoyed the game as it was very challenging and how players strategies had to change as the industries developed and the coal/iron supplies ebbed and flowed. Definitely interested to see how the ships affect the game and the number of players affect it. Very solid, thought-provoking game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wallace has streamlined Brass into something faster, harder, and less enjoyable to play.  By removing a key element of luck (city cards are now region cards) the game has MORE options to evaluate each turn.  The loss of the canal era and the comparatively sparse board leave less room for mistakes.  In short, the quirkiness and charm of Brass have been lost.  What remains is a tough game [system] that favors 18xx afficionados.

Never played a full game of Brass before, so I don't have that perspective.  

But, it's one of those games where there is nothing to do when it's not your turn.  End-game is terrible, confusing and anticlimactic with the point scoring being extremely abstracted.  

Plus, it's totally UGLY!!!!!!

I honestly can't say. There's a game here, but it suffers far too much from the echoes of the greatness of Brass and all the things that are missing. 

I'll play it a couple more times and see whether it gets short enough that I don't mind the bits that are missing.

This is an interesting tweak on the core systems present in Brass. There are a few key differences that make it a truly different beast to its older brother. The rail system is much more contested which leads to a greater emphasis on development. The additional coal added to the economy through ships on the New England map adds a new dimension. The 'get out of jail free' option of using a whole turn to build anything using any card is a welcome option. I've gotta say- the card draw can really screw you over.

Hard to not compare this to the masterpiece of Brass. While AOI has the benefit of being able to play it with 5 players and streamlines the rules, there are several aspects that make AOI inferior IMO. Since development and and building industry are the only actions which require cards in AOI, and there is a new "draw cards" action, the pace of the game is slower- I did not feel as pressed to precisely carry out my strategy. There seemed to be more analysis paralysis going on. AOI is also more fiddly with all the loans being taken and paid off all the time- I much prefer the Brass loan system, Where an action must be taken and consideration must be made for the correct time to do so. I would like to try AOI with 5 in hopes that it is a decent experience. With 3 or 4 I don't see playing this rather than Brass.

Although it shares many mechanics with Brass, my favorite Eurogame, AoI has a very different feel arising out of its rules system. That doesn't mean it is bad -- far from it. It means that, moreso than, say, Steam vs Age of Steam, Age of Industry needs to be evaluated on its own merits, not as a simplified Brass. 

The rules are certainly more elegant from a player's perspective (the only thing that really bugs me is the useless ship cards on the germany map). I haven't made up my mind if I like the economic incentives that AoI presents better than those in Brass yet, but it is promising and hopefully I will get enough plays in this summer to make a definitive decision.

One of the best games by Martin Wallace. If you like economic games, this is very good (simple rules, many different ways to try to win, hunt for opportunities, nail biting until the end).
You can consider Brass as an expansion of Age of Industry, although Brass (in spite its additional complexity) is the better game!

RATING: 6
Age of Industry is a simpler, more streamlined Brass. Coming from Brass to AoI, it felt like a step down. I read the designer notes, where Martin Wallace states that if he had come up with the streamlined rules he would have used them for Brass, and I'm glad he didn't. Yes, things are a little more complicated in Brass, but I think that adds to the game.

What I do like about AoI is the idea of different maps which change how the game will play out.

I probably would have liked AoI a lot better if I had never played Brass. And maybe more plays will help it grow on me. Or someday I'll find myself thinking that Brass has too much fiddliness comparatively. But for right now, I'd rather play Brass.

I got this to see what the fuss over Brass was, while Brass also sounded more complicated than I would like.

The rules are intuitive and the game has a decent rhythm to it. "Loans," reminiscent of "unrest" in SoE, aren't nearly as annoying.

Players build various types of factories, railroads, and ports on a map, trying to satisfy demands and make as much profit as possible. The iron and coal supply/demand is based on what players do, which is interesting.

Player interaction feels pretty incidental and I certainly don't think any narrative of interest emerges from a play-through... I don't even think there is all that much long-term strategy. Build whatever will make money, and if resources are scarce, consider building something to produce them.

...Playing this again a year later, because it seems like a game I should like, as players are actors in an economic system based on a map (and I recently discovered Age of Steam and want to compare).

So, what is (frankly) dissatisfying is the low long-term importance of what you build. You might e.g. build a coal mine so that others will use it for their coal needs, so that you will get paid. Once that happens the mine gets flipped and does nothing further. All buildings work like this: Once an economic transaction is possible it occurs instantly and only once, and consumes whatever industries were involved.

After that your flipped-over buildings just score points at game end, and allow you to rebuild over them if you want to (so it's saving a place for you). Your railroads also have some long-term use in that you can't use industry-specific cards to build in a city unless you personally have track going into that city. (Aside from that there is no importance to who owns which links in the rail network.) All of these longer term implications feel like part of a different game system focused not on money but on building in as many spaces as possible. A little schizophrenic.

That said, I am not good at this game and am curious what a competent view of the strategy would look like.

...South Africa is a map worth playing I think. It adds a sense of progression to the game as players start at the coast and build inland towards scarce mineral supplies. AoI with this map is at least a 7.0. However, it still suffers from the same AoI problems of being too long, tactical, and random, and of requiring one to consider whether a move intended to help one's own position will actually just set up another player to take what you were going for.

While I like some things better in Brass, Age of Industry has the advantage of more maps. While the basic Germany map is rather dull, the 2 two-player maps (Belgium and Great Lakes) are very interesting. I'm not sure you need both in your collection but I find it so hard to choose which one to get rid off that I have decided to keep both.

Only one play. I bought this game because I enjoyed Brass so much. I still prefer Brass, despite this game apparently having improved on some of the "issues" or complexities of Brass. It just didn't feel as tense as Brass. I didn't feel as constrained. The agony of the choices in Brass is what draws me to it. Age of Industry feels like Brass with more freedom, which is probably appealing to some (I still think it's a great game), but it doesn't engage me in the same fashion.

AoS is a 19th Century industrial revolution strategy game. The expansions are in the form of maps to diversify the play experience without changing the components.  There is a certain level of coop as you share in your opponent's resources, but in the end it is all about expansion and control of those resources in the form of building and upgrading your mode of production.  Great game all around with the one deficiency being the first two maps, included with the base game, are ugly.

Works really well for two players; other economics games (18xx games, Power Grid, Acquire, etc) really need 3+. This one, though, it really *sings* for two-- so long as you discard about 12-15 cards up front (otherwise you run out of buildings long before you run out of cards).

Fundamentally not very different from [gameid=28720], so if you like that one, you'll like this one as well.  Good, juicy decisions, though mostly revolving around getting yourself a small edge on profit, to dig yourself out of the red and start making all your efforts turn to profit.  The stuff you're building interacts in really brilliant ways, and it feels connected to the history.  For thematic economic engine games, this is one of the better ones out there.

One of the best games by Martin Wallace (which are sometimes a mixed bag for me). Clean gameplay with interesting choices.

A good, clever game that, after a number of initial games when I first bought it, then sat for years on the shelf before selling it on.  I just couldn't find players for it--and there were better 3- and 4-player games that played at the same length. Eventually sold due to lack of play.

Age of Industry has a number of advantages over Brass. It supports five players, has expansion boards (with new rules, not just new maps), and has fewer rules exceptions. E.g., both iron and coal must be connected to networks in AoI, but iron teleports onto the board in Brass.

AoI is generally the cleaner game. For example, loans are handled with tokens (rather than on-board tracks), and don't require an action to take out. Also, AoI's market tokens are less onerous and less luck-oriented than Brass's foreign market.

The market tokens in AoI also add to replayability, since the available markets change from game to game. The only thing that changes in Brass each game is the cards that players are dealt.

Brass has a greater likelihood of a runaway leader, in my experience, and the two-phase structure (canal/rail) can lead to goofy/samey strategies just before the change of phase.

Rails are worth fewer points in AoI, which I think is a good thing.  It makes sense thematically and mechanically that the industries themselves should be the primary source of VP.

Both games take approximately the same amount of time to play. AoI isn't much "lighter", really, so I wouldn't let that issue play into your decision on which to purchase.

One disadvantage to AoI is that the cards make it more luck-dependent and tactical. You have to spend actions to draw cards, so an unlucky card draw can put you back a few steps. In Brass, in comparison, players are periodically dealt full hands of cards, so they're better able to plan out future turns.

Over time, I find myself less inclined to play Brass and more inclined to play AoI. Brass was released first, though, so it has its hard core supporters that refuse to budge.

Regardless, I like them both.

I've only played on the Minnesota map, but that its quite enjoyable.  Feels like more of an economic sandbox then I remember Brass being and exploring the challenges of the different expansion maps seems like it could be a lot of fun.  Unfortunately the strategy is a bit obtuse for new players to grasp and Power Grid ended up being the more popular choice for "economic game with many maps to choose from" so I traded AoI away.

I've played 3 games of Brass, and just played this.  It's weird to wrap your head around, but after a few rounds it's no problem.

Yeah this is a streamlined version of Brass.  My buddy calls it Brass lite, but to me it's just a hair lighter than Brass.

I really still love it, and think it's wonderful.  I even like the system of loans a bit better, and like the fact that there are multiple boards (with hopefully more to come) as well.

I still like Brass better, but not a TON better.

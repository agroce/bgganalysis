I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

In 2014 I was very interested in this game. Since my first year in the board gaming hobby I've been on a quest to find the right 4X game for me. Omega Centauri seemed to be the one for a while... but I never pulled the trigger.

Years later I got a chance to try it and, while I liked the game over all, it left me wishing that more development went into it. Some aspects of the game are absolutely fantastic. In particular, the deterministic combat is the most interesting and fun deterministic combat system I've ever seen. The way techs influence the outcome is really clever. Also the AI of the Empire is really cool. It definitively feels like an entity pursuing a strategy and not just a random sequence of bad events. The designer did a great job here.

However, two mechanisms seemed very off for me... again, I played it only once so this impression might change. The first is the culture track. I love the idea, but its implementation ended up being a simple scoring opportunity. Also it seems to me that it isn't something you can ignore if you want to do well in the game. However, the second thing that I dislike is an even bigger deal for me: the resource management. I find the system with the 4 resources really convoluted and strange. Especially with the whole school of eurogames out there, I don't understand the choice of 4 nameless resources that don't mean anything unless in sets. Even worse was the refill system!

These two flaws are unfortunately pretty significant for me and they diminished my enjoyment of Omega Centauri a lot. Many aspects of the design are actually excellent and better implemented than on many other titles in this genre. I just wish Omega Centauri would have been streamlined and developed more. Such a pity! An alright game that could have been awesome!

I finally got a chance to play this game from the files the designer sent me ages ago. I'm kicking myself for it having taken this long because this is a really good game. It definitely jumped ahead of Eclipse in this type of game even though it evoked a completely different feel. I'm looking forward to getting in a few more plays real soon.

RATING: 4
played just the short game, and it felt very underdeveloped. 1 viable strategy, many subsystems that add nothing to the game (1 example: there wasn't ANY reason for different goods types, for carefully selecting what's in stock and what not - there's 10 times as many goods as needed, and everyone has whatever goods types he wants).

i dislike galactic emperor for different reasons, but as a game galactic emperor at least felt like a finished product, not a rough draft of a game idea.

RATING: 6
First Play: The first read through of the rules told me this was a complex animal and I was grateful to have this explained to me. Although the basic structure of the game phases is clear the large selection of research advancements means that for a first play, much time is spent reviewing your options. Ditto the option to spend cubes early in each round for bonuses. Some research definitions seem a little vague and we burnt alot of time cross referencing rules. Text on the Race cards is in a fuzzy font and very small for no good reason when the font could have been twice the pitch and still easily fitted on the card.

The selection of focus actions works well however we did find that the concealed bonuses when you capture a planet were very swingy. One player earned an immediate era (?) advancement and with other useful points bonuses started to churn over 30 points a turn, whilst others could only gain 2 or 3. After 4 turns he was well over 100 points ahead of two of us and went on to win. Other bonuses discovered by other players were either useless or of minimal benefit which made the points gulf significant through no applied skill or strategy. I really dislike such lotteries in games and feel that a better more balanced reward system is essential in 21st Century games.

Resource cubes seemed generous in supply, reserve fleets were very scarce.  The game ran long and after 3 hours we'd only managed to cover 6 turns. Repeat games would churn faster but with new players delay is inevitable. First game has to be written off as a learning experience.

Second game and the blind bonus tiles offer an inequitable imbalance. I managed to gain three single point bonus tiles whilst an opponent gained the 5 and two 3's. A difference of over 50 points over the course of the game through no applied skill. As a house rule I think all point bonus's should be 3 to remove this problem.

An interesting mix of game genre, with the AmeriTrasher style military and economical technologies and Empire Ships to defeat, but a bit of Euro in there too - No dice on fleet battles, several paths to victory (economic resource management, strategic and military), and surprisingly quick game time.  Yes, you can play a space civilization game in under an hour (for the basic game) or under two hours (for the long game).
One playtest of the short game only so not rated yet but showed definite promise, long game looks interesting and as if it adds more features/complexity to the game.

Pre-ordered. Pre-paid. Then the whole thing fell through and I didn't get my game or my money back. It took like two years for this game project to collapse. I no longer had receipt details. I no longer even had an account with the same bank used to make the original payment. It's a lesson that reputable companies like GMT don't take prepayment, they take a pledge but only charge you when they're manufacturing the game.

Made up a prototype copy quite some time ago.  I enjoyed my play of the game and thought that the combat was very well handled, especially when combined with the various tech cards.  Haven't been able to get it to the table since sadly so I'm not sure about buying the real deal when it eventually gets released.

And speaking of... now that it's not in JKLM induced limbo maybe this game will actually get made.  I think another publisher who snaps this up will have a real gem on their hands and some guaranteed sales.

The prototype is pretty fun... It would be much better with higher quality components, obviously. I just played the short game version, where it did not feel like there were a ton of options, but I think that those choices would be multiplied in the long game version.
-
The produced copy of the game is also fun. I think it will feel like a better game after I am able to play without consulting the rules as much because it could become a relatively quick game. I think it would become a game with multiple easy decisions and a couple of major, direction-determining decisions. The presentation of technologies on a cardboard square with a picture seems like it is a bad idea, but it may become more acceptable after I know the technologies better.

I openly admit I need more plays to assess whether my rating is fair.  First impressions though:  The game looks and great though use of wooden tokens instead of ships give it an abstract feel.  There is a fair amount of strategy as you race to build your technologies and make choices to expand your conquest of the galaxy.  The rules are a bit complicated for beginners and some of the artwork on the tokens is really difficult to distinguish (especially upgraded versions of some techs).  Second play through felt much better than the first and I am sure this will turn out to be one of those games that grow on you the more you play it.

After ages we can finally play the game. I had no real expectations, I was just curious. Well, as with most games, it's not a bad one, but it isn't great either. There are many things I didn't like much and only a few things I liked.

What bothered me most were the random tokens on the planets. They range from 1 to 5 points per round, seriously? Then we have some who give points only once, like 4 or 6 and all of them can be obtained the same way. In short, if you're lucky, you get points fast and the other players are forced to come for you and this is what I dislike most.

There is a "rich gets richer" aspect running, too. Luckily no heavy one, but still...
Resources are just there to get more points and the only reason to have 4 different ones are a few spaces, where you need to spend different ones. It just doesn't feel well designed at all and that's something that came to mind more than once.

Finally got to play my first multiplayer advanced game, and it's friggin' awesome!
It's been a while since a game made me this giddy. It took about 4 hours to play, but we had to look up rules and technologies frequently, so I'd expect play time to go down significantly in later games.
I've found it's rather crucial to have a mobilization reference at hand - this information really should be on the player boards!

It also received high praise from one of the other players who compared it favorably to both Eclipse and Twilight Imperium. Another player wasn't entirely convinced, though, and commented he felt there were too few technologies.

But I feel this game does so many things right! It's full of hard decisions, yet there's always alternative paths to victory. I just love the deterministic combats and the way the Empire (AI player) gets stronger over time while resources are dwindling. Coupled with a galaxy that feels rather close, this creates a natural arc of suspense culminating in an incredibly tense last turn.
I'm tempted to rate this a 10, but I feel I must play it more often first. Long-term replayability is a must for the highest rating.

Extremely pleased with this game (played with the advanced rules!) for both 2 players and larger games.  Turns are very quick to process, eliminating most downtime, and the mechanics heavily stress the importance of getting inside the other players' OODA loops, which is something I always look for in a rich game.

I've played this once as a playtest and so will not record a rating here as yet. The experience was soured by the length (4 hours, not 90 minutes), poor rules clarity and the difficulties of a prototype that's still being developed. It has alot of promise but I don't think it will be treated as well as it promises.

RATING: 8
Played a prototype with the designer.

An uncluttered, extraordinarily quick-playing science fiction civ game; plays like if you took Twilight Imperium, removed the dice and cut out much of the copious negotiation, and overall made it smooth and easy, like a cold bottle of MGD on a hot day. The combat system is more like Diplomacy or Game of Thrones than anything else I can think of offhand: every piece destroys another piece, and whoever goes in with more force takes the first shot. Simple, though of course there are technologies that confer advantages. (The game also has some similarities with Galactic Emperor, but with a more extensive tech tree that really makes the research action choice vastly more powerful. As Nigel pointed out, he wanted you to be able to buy the powerful stuff early in the game so you can actually use it, instead of laboriously working up to it and using it once.)

Although this game precedes Runewars by a bit, it also warrants comparison with that beast; we played the short version, but the full length version has the same simultaneously revealed action selection, and both versions have the same movement activation process as Runewars, although again, it's smoother here.

If what I'm describing here makes you ask yourself, "Say, isn't this the holy grail of sci-fi civ-lite-type games you're describing?", you may not be too terribly far off, though there are a few things I didn't like. 

The designer briefly described the longer version, and there's a mechanic I object to on principle, where whoever goes first in the last turn gets 40 bonus VPs (in a four-player game), whoever goes second gets 30, etc. It's just an excessively gamey way of doing things, and I would prefer the cost to go last be paid in opportunity or something and not straight-up veeps. The graphic design is fairly hideous, but I was playing a prototype and the actual game will probably be a little easier on the eye. Lastly, there are a lot of points flying around, and you're likely to end up in the hundreds, which may not be to everyone's taste.

Other than those very minor kvetches, this seems like a tactically variable, speedy, and easily expanded game with enormous potential, at least on par with Cosmic Encounter and the other venerable sci-fi franchises. It's definitely an improvement on TI3.

For the sake of decorum, the part of this post that questions JKLM's sanity for sitting on a winning lotto ticket like Ascendancy will remain (largely) implicit.

--

Played this prototype again. This time, my reach did not exceed my grasp, and I managed to win, in part by gaming the resources a little, in part by investing in culture, and in part by just making damn sure to choose my techs carefully. Whereas before I was a little nervous about the gaminess of the long game (and I'm still not a big fan of actions that just confer VPs), I really want to play it. Nigel went into more detail on the techs and the races when discussing it with me and other other players, and it made me drool. 

Simply put, someone needs to publish this. Even if you don't think it's the greatest thing since buttered bread - and I'm not 100% sure it isn't ridiculously good - it's a solid entry in its genre, it has some new ideas alongside some old ones well implemented, it's really thoroughly playtested, it's smooth and quick, it can be explained in about ten minutes max, and the world is a little uglier for every minute it isn't getting published and promoted.

A fun and interesting space sim featuring deterministic combat and (very) limited research resources. Competition appears in more than battles as players balance different ways to earn points.
The chits feature tiny artwork that makes them hard to differentiate. I'm sure they were easy to tell apart during design on a full screen, but they help make the game feel fiddly.
I originally preordered this game back in 2008, but canceled my preorder a year later when it hadn't moved. The publisher folded (whew!) and I eventually it up from the new publisher in 2015.

I'm not going to rate it until I see the final version, but based on a mid-playtest version it has a heck of a lot of potential.  Elegant, diceless combat, a civ-like feel, space exploration, and efficient resource management all come together in a 90-minute game that is a heck of a lot of fun.  I hope to see some previous balance issues corrected, which will make this an absolute favorite of mine!

Played a prototype thats been circulating my game group. Looks very promising, it reminds me a lot of Twilight Imperium but without all the fat.  It really gives me exactly the same experience in around 10-20% of the playing time. 

The non random combat system is great because even large conflicts are resolved in seconds and the inclusion of neutral forces in empty spaces encourage combat from the very beginning (which I like).

One thing I didn't like was the different types of resources, it doesn't seem to add anything at all to the game. There may as well just be only one type and reduce complexity even further.

Played a prototype version once so far.  Initial feelings are lukewarm with the basic, short game version.  I didn't find the game so much fun as the game was too short.  I do want to give the advanced game a try at some point since it adds quite a bit more flavor to the game as well as a larger decision tree.  Too many things are worth points in the short game which seemed to detract from gameplay in that it didn't force a race to necessarily specialize in one route or another to victory.  The varied technology deck was a nice twist as only two of each type of technology exist which does force people down different paths to some degree in optimal ways to gather victory points.

Homebrew copy. Nigel Buckle sent me the base files and I worked up the cards, boards and tokens. Currently, I'm using parts from Galaxy's Edge as fleet and shipyard markers, but I'm probably going to store the game in with Twilight Imperium, meaning I can use the ships from that. My only worry is that the tiles aren't that big and things may get cluttered with TI plastic junk.

Spiral Galaxy 1st Edition. The game is a touch streamlined from my home brew, but the componentry has changed massively. Gone are the cards, replaced by tiles (takes up less table space, but I. Still prefer the cards with their effect descriptions) and the galaxy is now formed of hexes rather than squares (which is a big improvement). Quality of the printing is pretty good, but not brilliant for a modern game. Rules have improved a lot since the JKLM manual.

Great game, just could manage to get my hands on it on Essen2014.

The main thing which impresses is the easy game play and full content of an 4x game. But restricted actions and fast deplenishing technologies forces players to quickly hit their tactic. Game fun is increasing with experienced players as they can push themselves to a fast gameplay.

Enjoy it a lot for it´s easy and fast gameplay once it has been learned. Even the non-luck predictable combat system with initiative and just hitting each other is a good system as it goes fast but fair.

Love it and will play it often if possible

Not terrible, but not good either. 

This is just very rough around the edges, and there are enough other games that do the same thing better. 

It can be hard here to bounce back from a poor early start. The combat techs are just really important, so much so that this cannot be overstated. There's also a strange disconnect between the culture track and the game map -- so much of the points are to be gained from the culture track that a lot of other things just become moot. Turn order is also insanely important, especially later in the game. It can also become impossible for a 1st player to be unseated, which seems like a serious problem.

Had the pleasure of being taught by the designer himself. I really did not like Twilight Imperium that much and was worried because some are in the habit of comparing these two games. But I was pleasantly surprised and can now say that I prefer this one by a mile. It is dense and very easy to learn but hard to master (we only played the Introduction game) and there are many decisions to be made. Some of which might be too obvious in the beginning but that may be just the case in the beginner game. You usually have on less action than you need and that is the hallmark of a nice design. I like the multiple paths to victory (points) and I managed to do fine just by building so many monuments early in the game and refrain from a warfaring strategy (also because I stood no chance against Nigel anyway).

I would love to try to advanced game because of the various alien races, the secret action selection and new sector types.

I can only second Paul's outrage, why is this not getting published ?

--- Solo Rules from designer ---
Changes:
* Use one of the 2 player maps

* Short Game: Halve the number of available resources at the start of the game
* Long Game: Use the 2 player resources but halve them, including those added each round.

* Try to beat your highest score each time

Further adjustments:
If you find that you are easily winning the game try one of these:

1. reduce your starting fleet allocation by 2 and flip the barren sectors (apart from your home sector) over to the Quarantine side - you cannot enter them.

2. randomly remove 2 mobilise cards, remove one of the combat technology (Shields, Targeting or Torpedoes).

3. record the mobilise and technology cards you gained in the first game and then remove half of them randomly (round up) for the second and see if you can exceed your previous score.


The solo game allows you to try out combinations of technology, of course you do not have the pressure of other players attacking you or taking technology first (the 'further adjustments' section helps to address that).

Alternatively just play the game using 2, 3 or 4 races and swap seats playing each to the best of your abilities. This is easier with the short game as there is no pre-planning involved, so you can just optimise each action.

Looking forward to this a lot.

Now played with Nigel. This game is a gem, also close to the SF 'holy grail' - a space opera type game that plays inside 2 hours without losing the immersion that you get from TI3 experience.  Genuinely many paths to victory, simplified combat is genius - takes all the down time out of this type of game. Tech tree potent and differentitated, without being arcane. Tons of choices and things to do from the get go. Has a great feeling of 'old school' research/build/move combined with modern action selection + resource constriction. H Only based on Short game, the long game looks even more interesting.

How and why JKLM [or whoever] have not yet published this is beyond my comprehension - this, if it is ever published, will be a sure fire winner and will get into the 'Geek top 50 - it's that good. It migght be the game that restores JKLM's finances. 

It will appeal to the longer gameSF/Fantasy fan players and Euro players.

Eulogy over.

I'm keeping an eye out for this one even though my wife isn't a huge fan of the space theme.  It looks really promising if it ever shows up

Played late proto. Really nice little SF game. I like SF games, so this is a plus. Clever systems, lots of original and downsized mechanisms. Neat. Quick. Good. Only downside, for me, is the abstract combat system.

Can you make a game as fun as Eclipse, but without all the random?

Well, Omega Centauri is almost as much fun, and definitely less random. But sadly maxes out at 4 players.

Very exciting and interesting game, with a fantastic technology/combat/action system - could do with a much better rulebook, though, or possibly two rulebooks that appropriately separate out the "base game" and "advanced game" mechanics...

Very high replay value with a lot of different, viable strategies. Smooth rules, little downtime, decisions that matter. Surprisingly little bookkeeping. The "NPC" Empire is genius. As it upgrades and strengthens its defenses, I prefer it over Eclipse's Ancients.

The graphic design is appealing, though it could be clearer at times (the tech tiles are less than obvious at a glance).

A sci-fi civ building game with really neat looking artwork.  I'm pretty sure I would like this.  I'll have to read some reviews when it comes out.

The game itself, mechanics and all seem like it could have potential for much more, although it's not likely my favourite kind of game. However, a major bummer were the illegible components and player aids. A game should not have been published with such obvious yet easily fixable flaws in the clarity and usability. The first game which took 4 hours felt like a constant struggle to understand the game-board and unnecessary time went into trying to figure out what was where, and not in an AP-way but in a I can't locate that piece of shit symbol way. With increased plays when you learn the game by heart this would likely not influence anything in a bad way, but as it is now I doubt I can bring myself to go again.

Epic space 4X with usability issues. There are better games of this genre.

Both long and short games are great for all sci-fi lovers. the short game is very simple and quick to play but still with strategic depth and many paths to take. The long game features a much more competitive game with plenty of ways to attack other players. A really great game for all gamers.

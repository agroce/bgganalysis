This is a pretty simple (and difficult) co-op that should play well when we have older children. I'm not sure how much we will go to this as an adult game.

Nice to behold, nice to touch - this is child's play - but only because the age group stated on the box says so. The game is trickier that it looks, even if you play the easiest level. Takes about an hour and gets your brain cells busy.

A simple game with great components. But for such a simple game is it too freaking hard! I mean like we never won a single game or even came close on the basic game.

RATING: 9
There is a lot of luck involved in this game (dice and cards), but good cooperation as a ghost hunter team is the real key to succes in this game! Then even the hardest play mode is not a problem to master.
I wondered why I liked the graphics on the game box right from the begin. Then I learned, that it is from the same artist, who was also responsible for [thing=37406]Ghost Stories[/thing].

RATING: 7.5
I'm actually surprised by some of the low raters. My only explanation is that they have not rated it as a kids game.
It is very much a game in the vein of Ghost Strories/Pandemic were it is all about judging priorities: will we run out of the house to get those jewels out or tackle that haunted room, or will we spread out to remove some smaller ghosts out of different rooms to lower the chance of a haunt. Fot a kids game, there is definitly some depth and even for adults it is fun to play.
It might get repetitive after a while (can't judge for now) but my first play with my 7-year old daughter was great fun and we lost just before reaching the exit. For a co-op, such a tight game is a good thing. Especially as we carefully planned our tactical decissions, so it is not an easy game to beat.
As we played the basic game and not the expert game, I presume there is some longlivity in the box.
Glad I purchased it for my daughter.
One false note: the cheap dice with stickers.
The rest of the components are more than ok.

Simple cooperative game aimed at children. Lovely components (excepting the horrible dice). For adults, the 'advanced' rules put this nearly on the level of Forbidden Island (though less good because of roll-and-move). Rated as such.

A roll n' move game that magically works as a wonderful light co-op. The components and artwork are fun, and as you battle the ghosts, the danger and tension rise at such a perfect rate that the challenge is always present but never overbearing for younger players. When you're having this much fun, who cares how "outdated" the main mechanic is? I don't even have kids!

The randomness of the dice and card deck somehow make this a more exciting, less 'quarterbacked' game.  There's general strategy, but far less of the situation where one person tells everyone else what to do on their turn.  Light and fun, I really enjoy it!

I dont know why this is rated so high. There are much better co-op games. I bought this over estimating how much my kids, who are much older than how I see them in my head as i buy games sometimes, would enjoy it.

A very simple children's game that also has some rules for increased difficulty that will routinely have the game kicking seasoned players' butts.

The only thing I don't really care for is that the game isn't kicking your butt based on lack of skill, but more on dumb luck.  You need a lot of luck to win this game on the harder difficulty; at some point good decision making only gets you so far in this one.

However, when you do win, it's a little more exciting since it happens so infrequently!

A fantastic coop game that my oldest enjoyed a lot. You have to get all 8 pieces of treasure out of the house, but you can only carry one at a time. All the time you move around additional ghosts are added to the board and once a room has 3 ghosts a haunting occurs and the big bad red pieces come out. You can fight the ghosts with 1 person but a red haunting requires 2 people in the room. If 6 red hauntings come out you lose the game. In our play we had 6 treasures out and my daughter and I had the last 2 but we had to fight the hauntings on our way out and our luck finally ran out. Great game, can't wait to play it with my kids again.

Won our first play with the advanced variant, good little challenge

Terrific game for kids and adults together. Bought for my 8 year old godson. At that age the advanced game was understandable to him and made it a challenge for the adults, but he can go back to the simple game to play with his contemporaries. I fear, though, that we have created a little alpa-gamer, given how bossy he got. A worthy Kinderspiel des Yahr winner. Lost a mark because there's no English language version and, apparently, they won't make one. Sell those Mattell shares now. 

Update: I gather they have relented and will be producing an English language version. Hurrah!

The game is deceivingly difficult. My daughter likes to play so she can put the ghosts on her fingers.  The game is challenging and the end typically is exciting since the place has a tendency to get over run as you focus on getting out.

An excellent game for kids, perhaps even with their parents. But parents on their own? That's a tough one. On most turns you make two die rolls, which makes this feel like it's highly dependent upon luck. But there are so many rolls that it should balance out, right? There's clearly strategy here but the repeated die-rolling doesn't make it feel like there is. I'm on the fence with this one...

In normal mode, this game is pretty easy and feels like Forbidden Island in easy mode.  Add the extra cards for difficulty and ghosts quickly start to compound making the game feel like a haunted house version of Forbidden Desert. It's still a light game, great with kids, but it can escalate very quickly. Luck is needed with dice rolls, but strategy is also important to make sure you don't use all 6 haunts and lose the game.  There's very little down time between turns and everyone stays involved.  The board looks great and the components are excellent.  I really like the backpacks on the models that hold the treasure tokens.  Excellent family game that is fun for adults (at higher difficulty) as well.

Hm. My kids like the game, but I can't claim I had fun. It's just a lot of dice rolling with a lot of chrome on top. It does remind me of Cluedo where I always suffered from having some specific information but wasn't able to use it because the dice kept me outside the required rooms... I might rate this higher if I was a fan of dice rolling in general.
One thing that puzzles me: If you roll a six, no new ghost is added. That should definitely be the case on rolling a one, not on a six.

Very good kids co-op game with some decent decisions to make and good mechanics.  The board reminds me of Clue for sure but the game play is far different.  The components are great and although it's a "roll and move" at heart, the teamwork needed to fight ghosts and hauntings along with the mechanisms in which the ghosts appear make this a cut above most "kids games".  Highly recommended for 10 and under crowd.

RATING: 5
A cooperative pickup and deliver game with a roll and move mechanic.  You go into a mansion to pick up treasures and carry them out of the mansion or fight ghosts.  Each time you take a turn, you see what room gets another ghost.  If three ghosts show up, the room is haunted.  There are cards that cause the discard deck to be reshuffled and placed back on top of the deck.  

The game is relatively light.  If you get all of the treasures out in numeric order, you win.  If a certain number of rooms become haunted you lose.  There is some trickiness with certain rooms becoming locked.  

Overall, it was a rather forgettable game.

The basic game is fun, though replayability is low. My wife said that this is nice for kids and it was fun to play, but she prefers the other games she ever played. There is an amount of luck and there is indeed fun and excitement: hoping the dice turn up well...

I have yet to play the advanced version. I think that's a more 'grown-up' challenge.

very good co-op for children - we only played the easiest mode now but haven't won it yet. It seems very easy in the beginning, telling to yourself: how on earth can we lose this game with only 4 ghosts in the house? But then the number of ghosts grow and the house becomes haunted and before you are able to bring the last jewel outside, you've lost the game. Very entertaining roll-and-move game, even at easy mode. One of the best games for children.

BADABUMMM!!! Így kell bevezetni a családot a kooperatív társasjátékok világába! Egyből 4-szer játszottunk vele egymás után, változatlan győzelmi aránnyal (segítek, nem 100%). :)
Jelenleg ezt tartom a legcukibb társasomnak (bocs Panda, majd ha lesz csajod...), szemkápráztató a kivitelezés! No és akkor ez az a játék, ahol ha már a látvány bevonzott, a játékélmény megtart. Rendkívül egyszerű szabályok, kockadobás, kártyahúzás, és az lesz, amit dobott a gép. Persze ne higgye senki egy percig se, hogy ebből áll a játék, hiszen igenis kell fontos döntéseket hozni, amik elsősorban a priorizálásról és a megfelelő csapatmunkáról szólnak. Ebbe persze nem szakadunk bele (azért a szellemek megjelenési helyét be lehet határolni), már csak azért sem, mert úgyis tuti mást dobunk! :) És ez hihetetlen szórakoztató!!
Nagyonnagyon szeretnék még vele játszani! Kíváncsian várom, hogy a szomj az első győzelem után is megmarad e!

A 8. partinkat sikerült megnyerni! Nagy volt az öröm és a büszkeség. A szellemkastély közelébe sem mentünk ezután.
...Egészen a mai napig. Ma ismét megküzdöttünk a szellemekkel. Négyszer. Lehet tippelni!
25-28 év köztiek játszottuk 4-en, és imádtuk. Zseniális játék! Jövőhéten újra megpróbáljuk, de most már nyerni is szeretnénk... :P

I wasn't sure what to make of this game, but I came away enjoying myself. For a kids game, this is excellent. Most kids games are either mind-numbingly simple, or just aren't that fun...sometimes both. Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters manages to meet halfway between what kids are capable of playing, and at the same time giving adults enough to think about. Even with the basic rules, there's enough to think about here that you can't just play on autopilot. The roll and move is a bit of a black spot on the whole experience, but I could see an action point system easily being implemented here, a la Flashpoint: Fire Rescue. Very good game.

Just a dice-chucking luck-fest, but it actually makes you think about how to best manage the bad luck caused by the cards and dice. For a kids' game this is just stellar. I've played it with all adults at the table, and we still had fun anyway. The art, the minis and the straightforward objective all serve to draw players in. Strong stuff in the co-op genre, which usually leaves me fairly apathetic.

RATING: 8.5
Slick co-op game that's a nice addition to the collection of family games.  Very nice components beyond the stickered dice.  Cardboard jewel token slots into the backpacks of the four kid adventurers - similar to Wiz-War - and each model is unique, though an argument did break out between my two girls due to the fact that of the four player pieces, only one is a girl. :(  Two difficulty levels are nice - and the advanced game is no joke.  Games always seems to come down to the very end.  I like this one a lot - very much worth tracking down.

[b]Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My youngest daughter is a fan of co-ops, unlike the rest of my fam, because we can all win the game together. Forbidden Island  is the only co-op still in our collection, but Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters has a fun theme, some cool components and a very family friendly rule set so I ended up getting a copy for my youngest. The production is really top notch, the artwork is funny instead of spooky, the different minis are great, kids will definitely appreciate the toy factor found in this game. 

After our first play [i](this included all of my kids: 14, 11 and 7)[/i] Ghost Fightin... was unanimously praised as a great game. I'll admit that it was touch and go for a while as we seemingly were cruising towards victory until, all of a sudden, we triggered one haunting after another and were quickly defeated by the ghosts. Make no mistake about it, while the rules are simple, Ghost Fightin... requires coordinated teamwork if you want to win [i](we've been playing the more challenging variant)[/i]. In short this has been a hit with my whole family and I'm happy to have found another co-op my kids like, even I will admit it is sometimes fun to work together when playing games ;)[/i]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Spooky cooperative game for adults and children to enjoy together...and it's hard to win. The ghost figures are so nice...and there are so many of them. The game is simple enter the haunted house and find the gems; each one must be removed from the house by placing them in your figures backpack. But there is only room for one gem and you have to take them out of the house in numerical order. If a room overruns with three ghosts while your character is in the room, a haunted bigger red ghost is added to the room. He will trap you there until someone else comes and frees you.

RATING: 7
This is a really well designed kid's game that is a bit of a cross between Pandemic and a simple dungeon crawler. The goal is for all players as a team to get into the house and get the gems out. Every turn a player rolls the movement die, which on most results spawns a new ghost. You flip a card and spawn a ghost mini to the room matching the letter on the card. If you end your movement in a room with a ghost, you get to fight it by trying to roll a ghost icon on the combat d6. Two players in the same room, means you get to roll an extra die. When a room gets 3 ghosts, you replace them with a fire ghost, which can only be fought by 2 players, and only gets defeated on a fire result on the combat die (1/6). When all the fire ghosts are on the board, the players lose the game. 

My kids love killing the ghosts, they like counting the movement spaces. They love how some cards lock certain colored doors. They absolutely love replacing the three ghosts with the fire ghost. That moment is really cool for them clearly. They also really enjoy the process of putting the gem into their mini's backpack. The components are fantastic, and this is the first kids game I'm really properly enjoying as a player.

The game is for the most part incredibly simple, and as we constantly had to remind ourselves aloud "This IS A CHILDREN'S GAME". You roll the die, draw a card to generate ghosts, and resolve actions at the end of your move. You can fight ghosts and grab gems, and with the advance rules (which makes it an actual game and not trash) you have to remove the gems in proper order.

If all of the haunts come into play, the game ends and you lose. Which came into play later.

So we laughed and laughed about how simple this children's co-op game was, and then lost HORRIBLY.

Now available in sellout IP form.

This game is FUN and deceptively difficult!  It's like a super streamlined version of Flash Point: Fire Rescue will all of the fiddly crap removed and lots of FUN and excitement as been added!  I recommend playing the "advanced" game in which all jewels need to be recovered in numerical order and all players out of the house to win.  Don't let the artwork and cute ghost miniatures fool you into thinking this game will be just an easy kids game. The first several rounds feel pretty harmless, but once the ghosts accumulate and hauntings start occurring, people start to realize that the game can be quickly lost. Players sit up a bit straighter at the edge of their seats and begin taking the game much more seriously, but it's already too late.  Trust me, don't dismiss this game or enter into it thinking that it will be easy...  You've been warned!

RATING: 8
Okay, I'm going to make a very loose comparison to Pandemic with this one. Although the theme and the victory conditions for both are polar opposites, the gameplay and the cooperation aspects could be used to draw a parallel (remember I said "very loose" comparison). So why even attempt to make this comparison then? Well, players work together trying to escape the mansion with a specific number of treasures while ridding this domicile with the ever-spreading horde of ghosts. In Pandemic, players work together traveling around the planet removing viruses (and gathering matching cards) to cure or eradicate them amidst the continuous onslaught of disease cubes. Now does it sound a little familiar? If not that's okay, Im still calling it "My First Pandemic" but I think "Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters" has a bit more appeal. Where it differs from Pandemic is that it is heavily luck-based due to the die rolls. There still is a strategic side to the game but bad die rolls will crush you in this game. The components are top notch, the game play is simple to understand and there's little downtime. For what it is, this is a nifty little family game that holds it weight. The advanced game can be tougher based on the card draw but I've noticed about the same success rate as the "easy" game. This is a really fun kid's game that is just as fun for adults, so my rating reflects it's mass appeal to all ages...yeah I know...an 8!

Really cool and simple rule set that agrees with the Kinderspiele award. It's fun and the pace is quick. However, the dice rolls will absolutely alter the course of the game. If you hate how luck can seep into decision making, then this game is not for you. If you can shrug off the occasional, game breaking die roll, then this game is a good change of pace from your Splotter fare.

Oh so close...we were one die roll away from success in the advance game. Good times!

Perfect for family halloween game night.  It's got a ghost busters vibe, probably from the artwork.  It has some meaningful decisions, pandemic style, but not as intense so kids can handle it.  

My 6 year old son, my mom, my sister, and I (how's that for a crew) had a blast with this.  It came down to needing to move 3 spaces without bringing out the last haunting. It was my kid's turn, and he rolled exactly what we needed for the win.  Lots of high fives and cheering.  My kid wore his biggest smile.  Perfect.

Great co-op. Not usually a fan of roll and move, but this one implements it so wonderfully. Only have played the advanced game, since my gaming groups are adults. I like it. Like Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill, made kid friendly, with some dice. Sometimes the game can just screw you over with these dice, so beware. It DOES encourage a sense of teamwork and victory feels well earned in the end. The components are amazing, it looks great and plays easy. The theme is drenched all over this "invade a haunted house" game.

A simple coop game that perfects the genre for a younger audience with out being needlessly complicated. A very fun surprise. Components are extremely well made.

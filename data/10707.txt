This sends me back to the days of yore, before the Internet. Don't play much though. Needs players that remember where this game comes from or it's not interesting.

Can take too long for what is a fairly simple game. Outdated components although they do have some nostalgic charm.

Hacker is a game where you try to take over 12 systems before everyone else.  It is a bit light and there are some really broken cards (typical of Steve Jackson games) but it is a lot of fun.  Similar to illuminati in some game mechanics.

All elements of this game are present and in good condition.  Cards and markers look unplayed, with no creases, folds, stains, etc.  Black box shows some shelf wear on the edges, and a fingernail-sized area on lid near the top is white (tape pulled away black).  Nice, deluxe edition.

SJGames. Sheesh I own alot of their crap, and I don't even like most of it.

RATING: 6
One of the better offerings from Steve Jackson Games but we don't play it very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Probably the only SJ game I wouldn't give or trade away for the longest time, and probably tied more to fond memories.  This was one of the first games I was introduced to (and which I won the one time I did play it), and fitted my fancy at the time.  I bought the deluxe edition just to have as a reminder of where I came from.
  
I keep this game around for all the wrong reasons, the key one being nostalgia.

Clone of Illuminati with "hacker" theme.

RATING: 6.25
It's usually a toss-up between playing this and Illuminati.  Since Hacker is more about substance and less about graphics, most people tend to want to play Illuminati.  I like Hacker though since it has a good complexity to it.

The amount of components really does make the game look a lot trickier than it is. Relation to Illuminati can be readily seen, but the game stands alone. A lot of fun, with a great number of competitive play options - such a shame an alt virus table and additional compnents (allowing additional card draws, reallocation of empty servers, and the like) were never developed in Pyramid - plenty of ways these could have been taken. ... ... ...*lightbulb* (watch this space)

An early Steve Jackson Game. An earlier version of s Netrunner type game. Based on the famous 1990 "hacker hunt" by the Secret Service against Jackson Games. You invade systems on the net, backdoors, ninjas, phreaking, trading favors, viruses,ice, etc. If you are caught 3 times by the Secret Service you are busted and out of the game. 2 to 6 players with the deluxe edition.

The components are some of the most annoying for SJGames (which is saying something).  All the pieces are printed on glorified cardstock, and you have to cut them out yourself.  I had more fun assembling Twilight Imperium. Have yet to play.

I think I should give this another chance. It actually makes sense, in a C64-era kind of way, and the whole hacking mechanics are pretty well thought-through and applied to a game.

It's just that I don't remember the game being actually fun.

Ideal Players: 6

Description: Hack into servers, upgrade your equipment, and rule the net.

Pro: Theme-appropriate components. Well-balanced cards. Interesting building the map of the net. Neat use of action point system.

Con: Cheap components. Game largely determined by dice rolling. Mechanics reflect 80's and 90's theme, not modern computers. Game is very dated. Cards would be infinitely better with good art. Extremely long game for what it is.

Takes the right group to play this game, but the jokes that end up being made about aspects of the game make it a blast to play. A simple game at first, a lot can be added with the full rules.

Very good strategic game. A bit too slow at the beginning. Bonus points for those over 30 that are interested in PCs for a long time due to the hidden humor. Recommended to remove the virus and the worm however.

RATING: 9
Nice combo with the original "Hacker" and "Hacker II: The Dark Side" in one box. The game mechanics are somewhat similar to Illuminati, but the hacker theme and several original ideas make the game very enjoyable. If you were part of the underground scene during the late 80's you definitely will like this game.

Still fun, though many jokes are dated,and some of the concepts are no longer close to true to life.

The inverse of Illuminati although for whatever reason this gets a lot less play than Illuminati does.

Great ideas, but there is no particular reason to hack a server. So you have no longterm strategym you just wander around. I also had to change some rules since for example ICE was broken.

RATING: 7
Rated from nostalgia, have not played this since it first came out. Used to play it tons. Looking forward to trying this again. It's a nasty fun gotcha majority sort of game in the Illuminati vein, even though it is reverse-Illuminati. Clever mechanisms and good dated fun.

RATING: 4
It's fiddly, like many of Steve Jackson's games, but doesn't feel dated (except in theme, where it is horribly dated) to me as badly as Illuminati.  Too long by about half an hour or so, but trying to shorten the game (less system hacked for a win) seems to add more problems.  All of the stuff from the expansion can get extremely complicated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another classic and one of my personal favorites that I can't seem to get anyone else to appreciate.  This ain't no Euro.  For any player who knows 1980's hacker/internet culture, the theme is right on; for the other players, they don't understand how cleverly the theme fits the mechanics.  The game is cut-throat.  The quality of the cards is good, but the cardboard chits suck--the usual Steve Jackson paper quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Stumbled through the first game with 6 people. It's fun, but seems like it is entirely too easy to jack another player with raid cards and the like. I will re-rate after another game, probably with less players.

Game takes too long because it's too easy to stop the person in the lead. Also, turns can take forever if playing with all of the rules due to all the things you can do and let others do during your turn.

The game has a great concept and theme to it, and it's kinda fun to play a throwback to the 80's-90's era of hacking. The best part of the game, to me, is the story that lead to SJ Games creating it. Check out http://www.sjgames.com/SS/ for more information.

Good premise, but what really hurts this game is how easily it can get bogged down with upkeep every turn.  A single turn once took almost 15 minutes during a large game.  If you have any interest in the subject(hacking), theres plenty of inside jokes and references. NOT for casual gamers, but with a group of nerds, not bad.

Probably my "secret favorite" of the steve jackson card games (although I like quite a few, munchkin being my "public favorite").

I finally played this one.  I was very disappointed.  First, the game features the same mechanic that all Steve Jackson games now feature.  The draw card, play card or put it to hand, roll the dice twice or perform a special action, and go on to the next player.  This in and of itself is not bad, if it moves along quickly.  However, the downtime in a 6 player game was excruciating.  Each turn took about 20 minutes.  This was made worse by one of the other players saying that they saw a game of it played in 30 minutes!  

I can see where some people would find this game interesting.  However, the downtime, the sheer power of some of the cards, plus the downside of holding on to your cards really cut down on some of the strategic play.  Give me a game where the randomness is a lot lower,as well as the screwage factor, and I would enjoy it a lot more.

Give me Illuminati over this any day.

Chock full of loving nostalgia for a bygone age - the transitional BBS period of late 80s computing.  Unlike, say, Munckin however, the gameplay isn't an afterthought here.  Very fun, and I'm happy to play it when it hits the table.

RATING: 8
Besides the horror of getting the game set up the first time (you'll have to break out about 100 little pieces and cut a lot of things) it's a very addictive game. The fun grows, as more players are joining the game because you can have allies and such. Definitely worth a look.

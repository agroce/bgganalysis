Is this a gamesystem that is meant to encourage the sale of figures? Those systems are rarely good systems. I am not for sure, if this is the case for Black Powder.

[u]Some thoughts[/u]:
* dice intensive with widespread results.
* No defensive fire. You simply fire after your move. This favours attacking which is basically ok√©, but not in line with reality.
* Manhandling artillery means that you could use artillery as tanks by moving them forward.
* One system for all wars from 1700 to 1900. I don't know.
* It is not worth to withdraw your units from the line of fire, due to fire after movement. Games tends to clashes till some brigade - or whatever - breaks.
* Disordered units may not receive orders, which is a heavy penalty. You can't retreat them out of the firing line.
* A good miniature gamesystem should have multiple strategic options such as defending, attacking, outmanoeuvring, flanking, retreating to gain time or prevent losses, placing units in reserve. I believe a typical Black Powder game is a simple head on clash with firing and meleeing - nothing wrong with that - till one sides collapses.
* This game doesn't remind me of [gameid=15827].

A fun and rather fast-playing set of miniatures rules. Although the rules are quite light they are perhaps not the best choice for beginners though; it requires some prior knowledge to bring out the flavour for your selected period.

Always wantedd to dabble in tabletop mini wargames.
Thanks to Pat (agrippa), I was broken in w/ these simple, "dumbed-down" rules. Quick, easy, straightforward, but the odd Cavalry-Force-Infantry-Into-Square rule helped my Austrians defeat the French in the 11th Hour!  Exciting, I highly rec this ruleset for a painless entry step into the bigger hobby!

I can't compare Black Powder to other any 18th-19th century miniatures war games as this is my first.  What I can say is the rules don't seem particularly complex, but they are written in a very confusing manner.  It seems like the author wrote them as reference for players already familiar with them.  A new player should not ever have to wonder whether the numbers they are looking at refer to the number of dice or the modifier/Target Number of the dice rolled.  Unfortunately, Black Powder on occasion doesn't make that clear. I understand Black Powder is built using a 6'x12 table, however; I think it may have be more prudent of the author to assume most players would be working with a 4'x8 or 4'x6' and half the distances with the note to double them on larger tables.

I use Black Powder currently for American Revolution which may be one of the weaker wars for the game as the AWI doesn't make use of many formations or different types of units (i.e. cavalry) all that often.

Despite my criticisms, I think Black Powder is a fun game as I find myself more interested in gentlemanly games and scenarios where a players forces are chosen for them rather than that player building a force to then determining the scenario.

My first miniatures game.  Tested it out with NWIBA in agrippa's house.  Interesting game that I would like to try again, though doubt I would invest in on my own.

My favorite set of rules for Naps and ACW. I'm a fan of the command system especially. Simple but not simplistic game play capturing the feel of the periods in a toolbox approach.

Drove for seven hours,

Feels like it drags on a bit. I'm assuming local numerical superiority is mandatory, however the command system does tend to complicate that.

Based loosely on Warmaster, this is old-school wargaming aesthetics with contemporary rules.  A modern classic!

Great Wargame that I always look for at conventions to play.Plays fast, and leads to a great deal of hilarity when your allies get stalled up at the Alma River and your Franc-Tireurs are left to deal with a Russian Brigade on their own...

I recently purchased this hardback edition of the Black Powder rulebook. I really like this system and am a big fan of the Napoleonic Wars. The miniature for this company are very nice especially if your a beginner at Napoleonic battles. This is a very easy system to learn and you can make it as complex as you want.

Very close to what I'm looking for, but I'm disappointed by the lack of army lists.  I realize that casual gamers may want to throw whatever they have onto the table, but I'd like to be able to create counter-factuals and other what-ifs without spending ages pouring over OOBs trying to make for a reasonably even game.  I'll be keeping an eye out to see how Black Powder develops.

Well thought out rules. Very open to tinkering - in fact they seem to encourage it. Played several times, and each game enjoyable. We combined fire and save into a single D12 roll, and altered the sequence to initiative move, fire, then command roll moves. Plus the brigade break rule, we just did -1 to command rating per unit lost.

These are versatile rules for the nineteenth century particularly, as in my first game we fought a typical battle from the Second Franco-Mexican War of 1861 - 67 with several European nations being involved including Austria, Belgium, France and Poland plus Egypt! Mechanics seem straightforward - a phrase I like to be able to use about any set of wargames rules - and this one is no exception. Good value.

151117 So damn innovative I can't rate it too low, though the horrifically drafted rulebook makes it very hard for me to want to get back into.

130929 I played it once again after a couple years and found the game fiddly.  Its not a bad game, but its not a great one either.  And unfortunately the fiddliness makes me lose interest in playing it at all.

120102 Interesting game where you mess around with stock prices.  It may go up or go down, and will likely end up in my collection

SECOND UPDATE: The rules to this have been corrected (Thanks, Jay!) and now provide the ability to have the experience the designer had intended. Certainly not a bad game, but it is filled with a high degree of micro-managerial tasks -- which a checklist or flowchart should help solve.

UPDATE FOLLOWING PUBLICATION: The rules are miserable. There have been changes since the prototype, and at present, trying to divine the intent of the designer is impossible. This will remain unplayed and trade fodder if that doesn't change.

INITIAL TAKE ON PROTOTYPE:
An interesting take on open auction markets. It's a prototype, so the fact that it's a bit flat isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a little dry also. Not MANY choices to make, but some. Mainly attempting to seed the future market through decisions made at present (reminds me a little of Power Grid, no surprise).

Interestingly enough, this also reminded me of Age of Steam (cube setup and cube draw) and 18XX games (vertical and horizontal market pricing table). I certainly cannot blame him, as those mechanisms lend themselves well to this particular application. I think the use of these mechanics is an excellent choice.

Markets tend to be deathly dull... but with that said, I have faith that Friedemann Friese is capable of making this an exciting game with further revision. It's certainly a great first-cut at a stock market / open auction game.

Another play keeps the rating the same.  I enjoy stock market games (Acquire, Steam Barons, etc.) so it's no surprise that I like this one.  However, it is a little thinky and definitely not a game that I'd want to play every day.  Nonetheless, I'm pretty happy with my purchase.

I think Black Friday has had a slightly tragic introduction into the BGG world. The awful rulebook seems to have sealed its fate as a bargain-bin title, held in pretty low regard. I've played it several times now, and Black Friday has proved itself more exciting, interesting, and downright fun than 90% of the new titles I play. What a shame that it's so derided.

A decent game of the stock market with some smooth mechanics to keep things moving. A bit much luck in the pricing of stocks makes for run-away leader issues, but for a game of this type, it's fun. Runs a touch long and is brutally unforgiving for early misplays.

A very interesting market simulation.  I can hopefully look forward to many more plays of this, as it's not complicated and has a good length.  Tense too.  Unfortunately, the rules are fairly unplayable as-translated, even the Rio Grande ones.  I uploaded a player aid that should help, and there are other aids around here too that should help you play it.

I would be surprised if more than 25% of players are playing this with Friedemann's intended ruleset right now.

Update: Upgraded to an 8.  I think about this game a lot, always with fond thoughts.

As dry as a game can get, and without the benefit of an interesting set of mechanics to back it all up. The game feels very chaotic (perhaps as real stock trading should feel, but still not a positive trait on a somehow "more serious" game), and while there's not a ton of luck involved, the small parts where it is (as in the behavior of the market) affects so much of the game, it's almost impossible to make an educated guess as to what would happen to it in the future. Definitely not my cup of tea.

RATING: 6.5
Comment after one play. If one of the aims was to build tension as the market rises then this definitely succeeds. In my one game there were a couple of stocks that were on the point of bursting, players sold, then they just kept rising. The vagaries of the stock market were nicely re-created. When falls did occur I did expect them to be steeper though (as in Tulipmania 1637).
I can't comment on the quality of the rule book because I had the advantage of being expertly taught the game, but I can say that the game play itself is not complicated. 
I do have one reservation. Twice the same player was able to buy silver two times between price adjustments while other players could only buy once. Player order (or luck, in other words) therefore seems to play a significant part in the outcome - however I say that after just the one play.

Very poorly written rules.  Played one game with the wrong rules (so the stocks fell more than they should, and the game lasted much longer - we called it quits half way through.)

One play with 5 players and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's a very fiddly game which is unfortunate, but if you get the rules right it seems to create a fascinating game of player-controlled (somewhat) stock market.  That part is neat, but I see the potential for the players to "break" the game too.  I'd like to try it again.

RATING: 8
It was after several read-throughs of player aids and online FAQs before I felt comfortable with the rules. They're not hard once you internalise them, but the rulebook doesn't help you much to do that.

Its biggest knock in my eyes is that it has Friese's style of "balancing by adding weird edge cases that you have to try to remember". So in this game you have to remember that a stock price goes up whenever the market is depleted of a colour, and after the market adjustment pull from the bag, if it's *still* depleted then it goes up again, but in a different way. A lot of little things to try and remember, and some of them are of the type "whenever the state of the game looks like [i]this[/i], do [i]that[/i]". In other words, the change isn't triggered by an action, but a state you have to watch out for. That makes it much easier to miss/forget.

However, assuming you got those down, this is actually a really, really good implementation of the stock market. It shows the gradual increase of most stock prices, with a gentle pull downward if nothing much happens with a stock, with exciting jumps and drops. I really enjoy this dynamic game and seeing how it plays out. Somewhat fragile, though.

Once you get the confusing rules, the game starts to make sense. Funny pure stock market game!

Need to play it again, maybe too repetitive but has interesting mechanics and market manipulation tools.

*update*

Traded.

*update*

Repurchased two years later... 

Replayed after purchase it again, I think this game is much better face2face than in www.yucata.de because I enjoy the uncertainty factor of the hidden suitcases behind player screens and specially the bag.

Maybe it's a little too fiddly to explain and also to understand the first time but after a few plays it clicks and I started to like it quite a bit... 

Would you have the patience to discover the beauty under the fiddlyness here? I bet 90% of the times the answer is [b]no![/b]... but this is not the first nor the last game to suffer this issue in the times of "instant hit with your group or you better start to think about getting rid of it".

Another stock market game. Manipulate so that you can sell high and buy low. Not seeing anything super inspiring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 I think in general the market mechanics are pretty good.  Prices increase with purchases and decrease with sales.   The "crash" element is also cleverly done... the later the bull market goes, the greater the probability of a crash.   Also, the potential for an early game crash stops a player from trying to hold on for the entire game with minimal selling.

The one part that doesn't quite feel right is that gold buying allows you to place a color of your choice into the bag.  You would think that such anti-market activity wouldn't support price increases in that manner.   Still, that's the rule.   

Overall a very good mix between pushing your luck, taking advantage of price increases, and buying gold at the right time.   Near the end of the game the market movements became a little too predictable because there were only a tiny number of cubes in the bag.   

A good game, rating 8 initially, and certainly one of the better stock market simulation games out there.  Far better than the weak Tulipmania.

Not absolutely sure about this one but I do like it as it's attractively non-intuitive.  There's more to it than the usual buy/sell cycle of most stockmarket games due to the market crashes, which is 'a good thing' and I really failed to crack it first time out, which hopefully means there are depths left to explore.  My uncertainty though is whether the amount of footering involved in producing that result and the consequent longish playtime is really justified - which is probably down to the balance between chaos/randomness and assesable risk in the price mechanism.  Not sure what the answer to that is after one play but look forward to finding out

I rather liked this one. It has a very clever and interesting market mechanism that makes for an interesting game of evaluation and timing. The rules are not as bad as their reputation; this is just a quirky game that takes some time to suss out, and if you want to teach your group, do yourself a favor and pull everything out and go through the motions of a game to learn it before trying to teach. It's not hard, but as I say, it's quirky and unusual and hard to intuit.

I love me some stock games, and this is a stellar entry into the arena!

Black Friday is a totally new twist on the market system that really hits it out of the park.  The market is handled in such a way that players can gamble on the odds, which really makes it a fun game in a gambling sort of way.  You have a feel for when the stocks are about to crash, but the odds may not always play out as you thought, which makes nothing a sure thing.

The game also has a really sweet timing element to it.  In Black Friday, you can invest in either silver or stocks.  Stocks are what makes you money, but silver is what wins you the game!  In the early game, stocks rise like crazy, making them the solid investment.  However, silver starts out cheap, but rises throughout the course of the game.  The real crux of the game is deciding when to get out of the stocks, before they crash, and when to get into silver, before the silver price gets meteoric.

A pretty crazy good stock game here.  It's a real shame that the first English rules were absolutely butchered, leading to many poor reviews which really killed any momentum Black Friday had.  The rules are fixed now, so don't hesitate to pick this one up!

This is an OK simulation and an OK game but just OK.  There are much better games to play (especially since it's not super fast) and it's not nearly a good enough simulation of a bubble to outweigh that.  I won't avoid a game, but I would never suggest bringing it out at game night.

An elegant market system, reminds me of Power Grid. Mechanically sound, and reasonably smart. However, this game fails both as a game and as a market simulator (to borrow the words of Hill 218 designer). As a game, decisions take a 2nd seat to luck: if you do not pull your stocks early out of the bag, you will suffer defeat no matter how well you play. Such a degree of luck is unacceptable in a 90' game such as this one. As a simulator, the market-making function is completely missing, and thus distorts the whole fabric of the design. In real life you can always buy shares (generally speaking), you just have to pay the price. Similarly for selling. In Black Friday, there are times that you simply cannot buy certain stocks, and this is under normal market conditions. Where are the market makers and why can't I buy the stocks I want?

Almost all mechanisms are theme-braking: adding a stock to the silver buying track when you pass or buy silver, the left and right columns of the price matrix functioning differently than the other ones, the 3 sales tracks, the special action cards, the list goes on and on. I understand the necessity of these mechanisms, but I find them fiddly and non-thematic.

Overall, an interesting exercise in boardgame design, but not a game I will seek to play again, unless it is vigorously suggested.

I like the idea of the game a lot.  In the first few playings, I'm seeing a fairly boring market, though. Everything goes up most of the time...and then maybe the last turn you get a down-turn.  

Maybe we need more black shares in the bag to make the market more interesting?

Ultimately, I fear that there are less meaningful strategic decisions here than I want there to be. Its ultimately a betting game, where you have a tiny bit of perceived influence over the odds....but probably not enough to make much difference.  It becomes a game of timing opportunities and maximizing efficiency with your actions (like buying/selling all the amount you can at the time you choose that action). 

I'd be happy to play more, but I think this one will probably drop with repeated play.

Pretty interesting stock game. And it's all stock, nothing but stock, we don't need no stinking map or buildings or trains, so help me stock. If you thought Factory Manager was a stripped down, this is even more so. I mean, it's a stock game with not even so much as a veneer of any other theme on top. But it's souped up at the same time. It has a nice system by which investments can affect prices later, not instantly. 

Only one play so far. Hoping it will do well on repeated plays.

Vaguely interesting, but stock market mechanism is far too random and far too much can happen between player turns. If someone is lucky enough to make a killing early on allowing them to purchase a bit of silver when the price is low, while another sees the value of their holdings stagnate or drop, then it is going to be difficult to come back.

Is it wrong to put a game on a want list four and a half years before it will be published? Power Grid was the first game I rated as a 10 on BGG and the things I have been reading on this one make me think that I am going to love it. I've started working on a prototype kit from his website, so that I can give it a try.

After the uproar about bad rules, this one is no longer as interesting to me as it once was. I would still like to give it a try, though.

Not broken or anything but not a whole lot of fun. It is a pure stock-market game in that the market is not driven by other events within the game, it is simply an exercise in speculation based on probabilities and some access to manipulate those - feels very similar to Tulip Mania, although there is a bit more going on in this.

It is though dry and too fiddly for what it offers. There is no board aspects other than the market and therefore is less interesting (for me) than something like Acquire or Planet Steam, where the market is driven by things happening in the wider game.

On top of this there is a massive element of 'luck thrown in by the way the market movements are determined - you can be made or screwed by what comes out the bag. For the level of fiddliness and length the luck aspect is also too much - to the extent I should really nudge my rating down.

Might play again, but there are so many other things I would play instead, I hope I don't have to.

Get Acquire, or better still, Shark instead.

Purchased from Favorite Local Game Store at Favorite Local Gaming Convention.  Lots of fun with either 3-4 players; haven't tried it with 5 players yet.  The hidden information (starting stock shares for each player) keeps the "card counters" from having a huge advantage.  For that reason, the board game is a lot more fun to play than the online Yucata implementation of the game.   Yucata's version of the game has no hidden information, and that just makes the game a mathematical exercise.

Played one game that was a total disaster. Ok, it's a game called 'Black Friday', SO...
End game situation was that almost all the shares were around the bottom left corner of the board (values were something between 4 and 20) and silver was 2 or 3 spaces under 100 so we decided to end the game that early because there was no sense anymore.

It's a horrible rulebook and an the board is not without its share of green and white. But from this mess arises a rather intriguing economics game.

After one play, I think this one has the potential to be a great stock game.

Took a long time trying to understand the written rules;  definitely worth watching the 30 min. (!) video on the rules, and printing the flowchart from the BGG file section.  The briefcases are a bit small, but ... okay, they work.  It's not a bad game.  Perhaps rating will increase with subsequent plays.  Similar to Power Grid in that at some point it's worth converting from trading for profit to conservation and investment in silver.  It also has an accelerating game-end trigger, and you can decide, to some extent, when to trigger.  Also played well with two players, which is good for a market game.

I played this game more than 10 times while it was a prototype, and it was already a winner.  I made my own copy by using the files Friedemann posted on his website.  It simulates stock market fluctuations (panic buying followed by a crash) with less external influence than any other stock market game I know.

I now own a copy of the published game and have played it a number of times since it came out.

The rules are a little tricky to learn, but the game works well and provides variety from one play to the next.

Despite some staggering lapses, errors and omissions in the RG rules (I mean come on, how many years have these people been publishing games and yet some simple proofreading and logic is beyond them???), despite that and some very fiddly market adjustment mechanisms that took a lot to get our heads around, despite all that... it's a quite good market game. I liked the way that borrowing money at low cost didn't really hurt, you're supposed to do it. I liked that buying silver was actually the point of the game and so buying early had greater benefits than working the share market. We liked the share mechanisms and the black suitcases. The special actions seemed too slight to bother with. All in all a nice package for the discount price I paid. But you really have to read up heavily before attempting to explain, so many basic points are missing from the rules set in the box. Desperately needs a player aide too.

This game has been a surprise hit for me, I have loved power grid for my first play and have been looking for the next great game by the designer and this is it for me.

Everyone I have showed this game to have really injoyed it as well. It's play is simple and engaging with lots of depth. All you really need is one player that knows the games market shifting macanics to get by any initial clunkyness you may find in the organic nature of the market. If you want a good stock market game that realy focuses on just the tention of a ever changing market ,you get no better than black Friday.

RATING: 6
A good economic game that is hindered by poor rules and fiddly administrative tasks.

Players buy and sell goods in five different colors, always trying to buy low and sell high. The market values are influenced by the trading as well as random draws from a bag every round. The random draws mean that players can predict the odds, but not the outcomes, i.e., when there is more blue in the bag it is more likely to be drawn, but not guaranteed.

Overall, an interesting experience and worth checking out.

First impression: 
The big problem of this is the setup. You can begin with the wrong nuber of the wrong colour stocks and the taste of the game is similar to begin Monopoly without money.
If you survive to this first cut you will be pushed in a sea of (un)lucky sharks ready to bite, stealing precious resources and trying to push the price up and down.
The study of the shares chart is important and there is space for more than one strategy but you know... when stocks come out a black box...
If you are not afraid by the destiny, try this title; if your brain understands only the words "Splotter Spellen" avoid it!

Rating after one play with 4 players: 

A fine game of stock trading with a nice, new twist: players buy and sell stock which will more or less automatically rise for the first 2/3 of the game.  The game has a built-in market-crash mechanism which sends all stock prices down the drain at the end.  The players need to anticipate when it is best to sell stock and buy silver & gold.  Tricky, interesting game which nicely captures the more cynical aspects of capitalism :)

This is not a game you would expect from Kosmos. They probably thought so as well and tried to find a nifty layout for the rules that would make Schwarzer Freitag accessible for family gamers. This, however, went horribly wrong: the rules are a mess. I have only read them german, but have heared even worse about the english version.

No rating at the moment due to the mistakes we made.

RATING: 3
Not a very eventful game. Little luck too, which is good, but where there is luck involved (stockmarket prices going up or down) it affects the game in a big way. You can't plan ahead and in my experience once the black stocks get involved it goes downhill from there. You just take loans and convert them to silver asap. Loans need not to be paid back and there is just a very small penaltie for lending (interest). Maybe they should rename the game into Greek Friday?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The stock market theme doesn't really grab me, but there are some interesting things about how all the mechanics interact. Deciding when to buy and sell is interesting as you have only a vague idea of how the values will change, but you also have some control over this. The main complaint is the setup and upkeep the game requires. There is constant shuffling about of tiny colored briefcases from one board section to another then into the bag then back to the board then behind the player screens over and over again. It was fairly enjoyable regardless, but the math involved combined with all the upkeep made it feel a bit too much like work.

I have played Black Friday many times now, and it really is a gem of game design!  The system of counters in a black bag achieves the goal of introducing a limited randomness that can be mitigated very successfully by the experienced player.  The way that the market rises and then is forced down towards the end of the game works very well, and does trigger a race to "get out" which is really fun to be caught up in.

I like it for a similar reason to Modern Art and Container, i.e. the purity of the economic simulation - even though it takes a different approach to those two (you play a market that "exists", rather than creating a market between players).  Credit to FF on this one - I think he has succeeded in simulating something quite difficult to model and, in doing so, he has also created the first pure economic game that plays as well with two players as with five!

It is criminal that the poorly written rules seem to have undermined this game's popularity.  Get hold of the re-write on BGG if you buy this game.

RATING: 8
This pure economic "betting" game is a whole lot of fun and offers tense gameplay - ONCE you get past the terribly structured rules. What did Kosmos do here? It took us three games to finally play with the exact rules. And this where your options per turn are limited to only
i) buy shares
ii) sell shares
iii) buy silver
iv) pass.
However, share prices can be effected in several ways which are explained all over the rules. A summary would have helped immensely.

JUL12 OK, there is a good game in  here after all. All that was needed was a clear explanation of the rules and a couple of other willing players.

Game is all about investing/speculating in shares (with a risk/reward element with a fair slice of chance involved) and investing in silver/gold (VPs to you and me) before the inevitable crash in the market.

Not a bad game at all, but the people responsible for the original rule book should apologise to everyone who bought the game - it was that poor!


FIRST REVIEW
I have tried playing this game on-line a few times but just don't get it at all. 

Probably the worst FF game ever (and that says something!) and certainly the worst "stock game" I have ever played.

Rules booklet is a disgrace.

While the randomness of what comes out of the bag (despite any deliberate stacking of what is in the bag) can go against you, it is still a reasonably entertaining game.

The problem that I have with it is that it's the kind of game  that you'd want to play with 4/5 players, however if you play with 4/5 players then too much can happen between your turns that you feel like you just don't have much control.

Unfortunately this game is not good with 2/3 either, there just isn't enough interaction with all the different stocks. 

It's hard to justify ever bringing this to the table given that there is no sweet spot in player count, despite liking the mechanics of the game in general.

One of the best stock market games I've played for capturing the psychology of the market.  You know the market is going to turn, and when it does, it can be hard to liquidate fast enough.  Lots of tension as you wait as long as possible but then try to unload stocks before it's too late.

This is probably the best stock market game in the market... BUT!!! The rule book is not well written. The rules (for me) are simple enough .... when you finally understand them, although a gamer friend described this as a heavy game. 

Set up......
. Fill the sell markets with two of each color. In a two player game add two of each color beside the board to form a market... any other number of players add four of each beside the board.
Place 10 of each color in the bag plus one more of each color for each player (12 in add two player, 13 in a three). Each player pulls five stock and places them behind there player board. Then draw 20 and added them to the market beside the board. Place all black stock on the black spots on the board.
Place the start rule tile on the board. Separate everything else into piles beside the board.

Play..
You get to choose one of four actions in the game... buy stocks, sell stocks, buy silver, or pass.... you can also take as many subsidies as the rules alow (you can never have more subsidies than the current rule max limit), and play your additional action once at some point in the game, then discard it.
The amounts you can sell or buy are governed by rule cards that change as the value of stock go up. The rule cards also let you know the max subsidies you can have, as well as how many stocks will be drawn out of the bag when an adjustment is triggered.
When you buy a stock (or stocks when the rules alow) you add one stock to the buy market. The stock must be the same color as one of the ones you bought if possible...or any color if not.
When you sell you also remove one stock from the sell market (same color as one of the ones you sold if possible, any color if not).  The sell markets are preloaded with 10 stocks, two of each color.
When you buy silver you add a stock of your choice to the silver market. You do the same if you pass...  add a stock to the silver market.
When ever there are five stocks in a market (not including black) an adjustment is triggered, and the following four steps are used.
1. Pay interest on all your subsidies (if you can't pay, turn one over and you must pay for them on your next turn or you are out of the game).
2. Reset the silver buy tracker to zero increasing the price of silver by one for every three silvers bought since the last adjustment.
3. Draw a number of stocks indicated on the rule tile (the number at the bottom of the tile next to the black briefcase symbol). And adjust each stock.
For each black stock that comes out you will increase the price of silver by one
If only one black stock comes out you will place it back in the bag. If two or more come out each black stock will count negatively against each color, and then are placed beside the board.
4. You will then look to see if any stock has passed into a higher zone than the current rule tile (there are ten zones.... start and then 1 through 9). If a stock has passed into a high zone you will reveal the rules for that zone. For each zone you had to increase you add a black stock to the bag.
The stock drawn from the bag then is placed in the market beside the board...And the stock in the market that triggered the adjustment is placed in the bag (including the black stock next to the sell markets).

Additional rules... when ever exactly three of the same colored stock is in the same market the value of that stock is advanced one space to the right. When ever a colored stock is depleted in the market move the coresponding stock one place to the right
When ever you sell a stock, you must move one stock in one of the colors you sold one space to the left... you choose if you sold more than one color.
Once all three selling markets are depleted, refill the middle sell market and use this market repeating as needed.
The game ends the instant silver is worth 100. 
Take all the subsidies you are alowed... sell all your stocks... buy all the silver you can.... the person with the most silver wins (gold = 5 silver).
Send me a message if you have any questions :)

This is a pure stock trading game in which the market goes up for various goods and then crashes. The mechanic of timing is done by having cubes that can be bought which can increase the price, but also leads to them being put in the bag. Then there is a better chance of drawing them from the bag which will further increase the price. As the game goes along black suitcases are added to the bag which if drawn can push the prices down. Stocks will need to be sold which decreases the price but gives you cash to buy silver which is used for final scoring. The price of silver continues to increase throughout the game until it reaches 100 to trigger the game end. Loans called subsidies are also available to buy stocks. In this game using the loans is a necessity and not punitive. There seemed to be a lot of little rules that add to the complexity and make timing a challenge, but there is some satisfaction when your market predictions work out.

Played this again on Yucata. This time, the game worked. Players speculated on higher courses making it shorter and more satisfying. Big plus: the system took over the annoying administration. Not exactly a recommendation for buying the game but proof that it can work... sometimes.
---
I can see that there's a good game in there. Somewhere, most of the time probably. Just not always as the game is too prone to groupthink. It is all about speculating on the market, pushing prices higher and higher, selling at the peak before the collapse and investing in the safe silver in time. Too bad that all this speculation didn't happen in my game. We played with 5 players. 4 of them (yes, I was the fifth one) decided to play it safe and always sold as soon as the selling price permitted buying silver. Therefore, all efforts to push a share were doomed. The game was cash-starved and took much longer than it should. It wasn't fun this way. Add to this a noticeable luck factor in the development of market prices and the usual fiddlyness of Friedemann's games and I have to pass on this although I can imagine that it is fun with a daring and speculating group. In any case, it is better than the other 2010 big Friese game Fürstenfeld.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it.  While the players can definitely influence the market, the random draw "simulates" the masses out there that have more of the buying/selling power and the black briefcases, the overall economy.  A fast playing time helps this one hit the table a lot.

A very fragile game, missed rules (as exemplified by the fiasco regarding the rules in early copies at Essen) will kill any interest the game has.

But I like it - there are a lot of games that try to model a stock market type of situation.  I admired the intention behind Tulipmania, but something about it just didn't feel right.  I also like the bluffing and open/hidden information in Hab & Gut.  But this one feels unique, even if the physical production of the game is bland.  The board is very uninspiring (a big grid of numbers!) and they don't even try to theme the stocks beyond a few icons on the board that everyone ignores.

But the rise and fall of the stocks has the right blend of planning and luck (which is more luck than planning) to provide enough of an illusion of control.  I also enjoy the way players are encouraged to cash out early, due to scarcity of money and need to buy silver.

We'll see if the game has long term staying power, but for now it's fun.

There is a serious press your luck element to the game. You know the market will crash, but maybe your color will pay out one more time before you should dump it.

It's a shame that it is so difficult to get a stock market game played, especially when it is so unique and interesting as Black Friday. Black Friday manages to capture the phenomenon of bubbles and their inevitable bust on the stock market. It uses a very intricate system to pull this off. Unfortunately, the rules are not the best and the system is very sensitive to mistakes. But if you play it correctly, it is a very interesting game.

First play was good.  There is potential for this game to go up or down.  I found the flow slightly fiddley.  I guess we played correctly, but the transfers and holding back of black cases seemed strained.

The market is basically programmed to climb, plateau and then crash.  Certainly there is room for wild variations, but on average it seems like this arc is predestined.  So you need to ride the stocks up, hop out at the top of the bubble and buy silver whenever you can.

I don't see how I would try anything much different from game to game - which makes me question how much staying power this game might have for me.  

UPDATE: After my second play my rating drops from 7 to 6.  The game is more of an event.  While you do get to make meaningful decisions, the chaos of what the other players do combined with the luck of the draw form a huge variance.  I am not convinced its a good exchange of effort for payoff..

Black Friday is about stock trading, nothing else. Good news is that its market mechanism is more interesting than in any other economic game I've ever played - it rewards calculated risk taking, diversification, careful planning of your liquity, requires well thought out timing decisions and so forth, just excellent stuff.

There is one major downside to Black Firday. The game requires players to remember many minor rule details of how the market is adjusted. This is a problem, because a) playing even a minor rule wrong may wreck the game completely and b) the rulebook is awful to the point that it is pretty much impossible to play the game correctly from the original rulebook (download a better one from 'geek files section)

Thoughts are uncertain after one play - needs another.

LIKE:

* Volatile market possible - but you can only play the odds/probabilities.  
* You can plan to improve the odds of your preferred stocks going up...or down.
* Board and bits are quite colorful.

DISLIKE:

* Rules are horribly formatted.  Thank goodness for the extremely helpful flowchart on BGG!
* I'm uncertain there is much replay value in the game.  While the market can be quite different each game, your actual choices in actions generally would seem to remain quite constant.

Tom Vasel seemed to be positive about the game. He does, however, say it's not forgiving.

The game seems worth having, but only at a relatively inexpensive price.

2)So many things that you need to remember (how to adjust the price, move right/ up ... Together with the world's worst rulebook (yes, that's the WORLD'S WORST!!!) making teaching and remembering the rules in this game a pain in the ass.
edited on 12/8/2012: With 3 sets of rules (the original one, the flow chart designed by Peter Johns and the quick reference by William Bussick) hopefully I'm playing with the correct set of rules :)
Remember to get them in order to run this game correctly!

This is a weird one for me - I couldn't stop thinking about it between the first few plays.  On my last play, the luck of the draw left a bad taste in my mouth.  Would like to play another time or two before trading it, but we'll see.  Maybe I just didn't get it, but thought I did.  I'll be looking for a different stock game in the mean time.

Compares infavourably to Friese's own Power Grid. The heaviness of the turn order and lack of simultaneous actions (it's a stock market after all) made it first a bit chaotic, then it became programmed. It somehow compares to SCNF but that game was fun.

Known by many as "That Friedemann Friese game with the bad rulebook", Black Friday is a thrilling stock market simulator. Fans of Friese will feel right at home with lots of number crunching and competition. You will build confidence in your predictions and then watch them shattered in a manner that truly feels like the stock market. Great game.

Intriguing market mechanism which, as a non-economist, seems to replicate the fickleness of the market rather well. A very interesting game to play, though it's debatable whether the winner is decided by player choices rather than luck of the draw. Freidemann Freise seems to think good players make a difference - as yet, I don't have enough experience to judge, but I wonder: does it even matter? This is an intriguing game in terms of just watching how things develop - almost like playing the old computer simulation Life. It's random, but there are patterns. Whether the game lasts long enough to take advantage of that is pretty much moot.

Lots of nice ideas. I have no idea what I think of it.

Initial reaction: although this is an extremely dry stock game the market mechanisms and eventual stock-market crash work very well.  I really think Friese did an excellent job balancing the predictability of fluctuations based on purchases and sells by the group with the luck of the draw which although can cause sudden jumps in prices is also based on known probabilities influenced by earlier decisions.  The loan mechanic and how one need not bother paying them back is genius too.

*Nov 2013* Thanks Santa! Stoked about this one!

*Dec 2013* After 2 plays, this one regrettably gets sold. In short: this does not replace Chicago Express as my go-to quick economic make-money game. 

What this has over Chicago Express: 
1) Plays well 2p
2) The market mechanism and design is definitely more interesting.

What Chicago Express has over this:
1) Less fiddly with components (setup with BF is a bear)
2) PLAYER INTERACTION
        This is the biggie. BF is almost multiplayer solitaire. See my thread here: 
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1085599/am-i-missing-something

Unfortunately, even though BF is a very good game and one I'd be happy to play, shelf space is VERY limited and this one has to go. I had high hopes for this one as a keeper :(

neat ebb and flow.  just a tad longer than a longer filler (if that makes sense).  neat mechanism of converting dollars into victory points.  somewhat underutilized as a mechanic, but tough to make work.  this works here as the market can really break lower due to the black briefcase draws.

for sale probably the better game all things considered, but this warrants a few plays.

Black Friday is basically a "spreadsheet" stock market simulation, but it has a very pleasing feel and a graphic design that is inviting and appealing.  The rule-book is the worst I've seen and this is unfortunate because the rules are like a razor-back ridge: a tiny rules mistake can have you falling into a bottomless chasm.  In my 4th game, we got 1 small rule wrong with regards to the handling of black briefcases and this caused the game to last 3 grueling hours instead of one!  In my last game, we got all the rules right and we were rewarded with a super exciting quick, dynamic stock market simulation.  I'm bumping my rating from 5 to 7.

Easily the most spreadsheet-y spreadsheet game I've ever seen or played. It's relatively interesting; the owner described it as "Tulipmania if it worked", and he wasn't entirely wrong in that assessment.

I'm not exactly sure what all the finagling [which was handled in game by two two-sided flowchart player aids... lol] of bits was supposed to represent, thematically or even mechanically, but the game played reasonably well and had reasonable interest.

Otherwise i think this game is really good but please for gods sake get the rulebook rewrite from the file section. This game has the worst rulebook i ever read. Careful the rewrite has still one mistake: If you do buy the last of one resource the price marker moves UP and not to the right.

-> Most of the times, the strategy to follow is rather obvious. There are 0-2 big decisions each game (basically, when to start selling) and the outcome depend on those.

-> The initial distribution of the cubes can be key. Those who get cubes with a strong presence in the bag get a HUGE advantage (that can be decisive).

Side note: with 5 players, you play very few turns: you have to do things in advance, and that means start selling the stuff well before.

RATING: 9
According to my opinion this game correctly simulates many stock market's situations, especially the feeling that a stock will soon fall but you are not able to predict exactly when and how much. And usually you take the wrong decision, selling too early or too late.
In every game there is a major crash or two-three minor falls, according to semi-random and semi-predictable rules.

However, some players dislike it since the setting is only a stock market, with buying and selling abstract things without having the feeling of having built anything (exactly as it happens in the stock market!)

Rules need to be rewritten probably in a more concise way or at least empathizing the "easily forgotten" points. However, once you get them, they are very short to explain and easy to remember.

Score is for my rethemed version with real stock market companies.

Although I somehow enjoy the game, it has a couple of really annoying elements: 
- Flimsy paper money and ridiculously undersized screens
- Incomprehensive rule book and incomplete rules
- A lot of fiddly bookkeeping
- Implausible immersion of market mechanisms
- Too random for an economic game
All in all, I often find it difficult to see cause and effect of player actions.

RATING: 5
The game begins with promise, jumping on stock bandwagons (ie that have lots of cubes in the 'Price' bag and therefore offer most promise of going up in price) whilst trying to eke out stock advantages over other players. And then the stocks you invest in, against the odds, don't go up. Other players' stocks do, they get a windfall, sell out because it's not going to happen twice and buy victory points at cheap prices. With each turn, even if you're in the most promising stock, more and more pus cubes get added to the price bag, diminishing the chances of your stock rising. Meanwhile the cost of victory points is also increasing each turn. So you're shafted on both sides of the fence. And thus does the game go. Your result, and the game, is that fragile that I don't want to play again, despite the idea and the mechanics being interesting during play.

Based on one play: A stock market game with a weird feel. You buy and sell shares in an open market and then based on the number of briefcases (tokens) pulled from a bag the price adjusts. You know what is in the bag and can control what is added to it, thus you control the likelihood of your shares increasing. Others can cause the end of turn to occur earlier based ont he actions they take, so be careful, don't get too greedy.

RATING: 5
I didn't much enjoy this pure stock market game.  The game has five different stocks (represented by colored briefcases) that players could buy or sell based on availability, and the price of the stocks went up or down based on the player actions as well as a random bag draw.  You can also buy victory points (represented by silver), whose price only goes up as the game goes on.  It was very difficult to figure out what to do because of the large random factor, and often it seems like the best thing to do was mimic other players.  There are also a ton of administrative tasks in the game, which were both time consuming and only helped obscure what was going on.

Stock and Shares and high rise towers! Can you really plan in this economic game? The board is a bunch of numbers and the theme has animals looking upon this board, with red pointy arrows going up and down. This games does have a nice stock/share system and I did remember having fun playing it. The problem is my group isn't a big fan of these games due to the frustration levels when your shares do not increase in value. The mechanic wasn't special enough for me to think what it was and surely that is a problem.

Didn't make the cut because it was the German edition with German words. Would have kept it otherwise, can't guaranteed it would have stayed in my collection. Would like to play it again- see my review of Crude!

I've tried a bunch of Friedemann Friese's games, but I'm starting to think his only good design is Power Grid (and First Sparks).

The cover art is weird and doesn't have anything to do with gameplay.

For a game about the stock market, this one is pretty fun. The one issue I have with it is that the rules for moving the stock prices around can get quite complex. In my first game, I was doing pretty poorly, but ended up not far behind on the end score (actually, one of the expert players ended up just one point over me). I would play this any time it is offered, but it is not the kind of game I would buy because it does not fit my family likes.

The game has an extraordinary fine mechanics. I've never played a stock exchange game with such an amazing math behind the whole price modification. And, it's actually easy to do (no need to calculate anything more than single digit add and subtract); the whole magic comes from a black bag introducing a time delay and some randomization. I really enjoyed playing it; so did my wife. It simulates the stock exchange and prices in a way you wouldn't believe: you are able to predict but unable to specify the time it happens. Fantastic!

That said and all the niceties out of the way, we come to the negative aspects: The rules are the absolute crudest difficult to understand and error prone thing I've dealt with in the last years (and I came across some).

If you like to play the game, you have to download the rules rewrite here from boardgamegeeks - it has no (known) errors and explains the game quite thoroughly.

Don't waste your time to read the original rules in the box. Even the updated Rio Grande version of the rules (2nd version) is wrong, difficult to understand and misleading. Can't help. If I would rate the game from that I'd given it a solid 2/10.

Black Friday is probably one of the best ways to simulate a random stock market with limited market impact in a board game. Of course you have artificial restriction as being limited to either buy stocks, sell stocks or buy rare metals, and each transaction has a limited volume. But I think you cannot design a board game without these restrictions without degenerating it to a pure luck based game. Maybe with a lot of insider information, but then it is hard to obscure optimal decisions.

Ok, back to Black Friday. This game relies on a very clever mechanism, how buying stocks will increase the chance of an increas in the stock price and sales decreasing the chance of a rise. This is done by pulling small wooden briefcases of different colors (each color representing a certain stock) out of a bag. With progress in the game more "black briefcases" go into the bag, which cause all prices to decrease if drawn from the bag. Your goal is to buy silver, which is steadily increasing in price. So will your stocks' prices increase faster than silver, or should you better buy silver right now?

Each play tells a very  similar story. You start out with some stocks and some (semi) public information which stocks are more likely to rise. You take loans and increase your stock holdings and stock prices will rise. In the middle of the game more "black briefcases" enter the bag and you should start selling stocks and buy silver. In the end game you get rid of your remaining stocks and try to purchase more silver before there is another price increase.

I really like the clever mechanisms of Black Friday, but these require at least on player to run the game very well and not forget any price adjustments, as this game is very fiddly. In the end you have typical stock market feeling "Will the prices continue to rise, or should I cash in", which I think to be extremely thematic. However, the narrative arc of each play seems rather similar, so I am not sure how many interesting plays are in this game. Since you have only limited actions, I think this game is better with less (=3) players, because otherwise it takes too long till you can react to market changes.

A stockmarket game. Buy and sell commodities on the market, trying to predict when the price goes up and when it goes down. Use that money to purchase silver and gold, and see who has the most money at the end.

Complex rules, difficult to understand how the market works. It helps to play it on yucata.de because there the system ensures rule-consistent play. I think this is a good share market game because it's not very luck dependent since it's possible to calculate the probabilities in order to make good decisions.
I think this plays better with more than two players. The more players the better. Like in reality there should be lots of share holders.

The game gives you a lot of opportunity to influence the market, but how to do that properly sure wasn't obvious to me in the first play.  Even with just going with the flow on market changes, the game was fun.  How influence is performed is apparent to me now that the game is over, but I think the effect will be minimal.  It still would have made the game more fun knowing it at the time.

Not much control - especially when playing with more than three players. Stocks go up and down. There's not much to think about on your turn - you're just reacting to the other players. It's all about timing your sprint to get out of the market before it falls and convert the cash to silver. It all works, but it's kind of boring trading in different coloured suitcases and shares. Would it have hurt to inject something thematic into the proceedings? I guess I can think of better ways of using my gaming time. Disappointing considering the time I invested in comprehending the rules. For a slightly better stock market manipulation game try Hab & Gut.

Just to complaint about something, perhaps it is a little bit fiddly in its "burocratic" aspect (where and when to put briefcases, when to change prices, what makes a price to change...), but not to the point of spoiling the gaming experience.

Played one game, the rules being explained to me. Still didn't really understand what was going on for a while. Apparently our game went further than most as the black briefcases were almost absent from the draw bag.
Muddled through but it all seemed out of control. Need to try it again to get a definite feel.

Raised my score all the way from 3 to 7 now that I actually get how the game works, which took a few plays. 
As expected, "buy low, sell high" to make money, which you then use to buy silver (which exchanges for gold, which is what the end game is scored with). 
Every time a color is bought or sold, it is added to a buy or sell table, which means once one of those tables has exactly 5 briefcases on it, a price adjustment happens. 
If the adjustment is started by the sell table, it adds black briefcases to the draw bag, which have a negative effect on price movement. 
Getting the buy table (or silver table) up to 5 briefcases adjusts pricing without adding any new black briefcases to the draw bag (however, new briefcases aren't added to the bag until *after* the current price adjustment - so right now you're dealing with whatever was added after the last one). 
The buying of silver bars increases the price of silver - up one spot for every 3 bars purchased, so as the game progresses silver gets more and more expensive making it harder to buy. 
Although it is a bit random (as after all it's the stock market), it's interesting to try and figure what is best to buy, hold, or sell based on what is on the tables, what the other players are holding (and thus might sell off), etc.
I've decided I really kind of like it.

Horrible rulebook! I had to watch videos, because some rules are not even mentioned in my copy's rules. The game itself is not that bad, but a bit too long - especially if you buy gold too early. Then you're stuck passing for several rounds. 
The components are awesome, the bright and cartoony art is gorgeous, but it - in my opinion - doesn't fit the theme.
It's probably the best stock market Simulation i have played - I just didn't enjoy it enough to keep it.

Holy crap the rules are terrible for this.  So many rules were only mentioned in examples and some of the examples referred to rules that were nowhere to be found, but were only implied by another graphic. Even after a restart and combing through the rules we discovered that we'd still played something wrong at the end of the game (all suitcases after the first one pulled goes into the supply not the bag).

That said we muddled through it and I thought that it was a very clever and inspired game that stood out as being really different from most stock games.  

I think that five players is burdened by too many actions changing everything about before it is your turn.  I suspect that this will be get a much higher rating from me when I play it with a clean knowledge of the rules and three or four players.

RATING: 2.5
I will not say that this game is bad, but it is very confusing. I just played it once and did not really get the rules (normally something I do not have problems with). I think we played everything according to the rules, but it did not really make sense. I might correct this rating upwards if I play it again, but I actually doubt that. Maybe I am just not the right person for the game.

My rating could drop with more plays, but very enjoyable first impression. Nicely simulates an equity-versus-metals market using an 18xx-style share price grid. Lots of fun luck-pushing throughout. Like Union Pacific in that the most valuable commodity in the game is actions. Tempo is also extremely important, so that different numbers of players will likely provide very different games.

RATING: 8
Not exactly sure what to make of this - it's interesting, but I'm having trouble understanding what are good moves, and when to buy and sell. It would seem that the first player would have a huge advantage with all the extra stocks, but perhaps you're supposed to start out by buying a bunch of stock.

UPDATE: The first player doesn't get a bunch of extra stock. It's actually a pretty good stock game, although a little fiddly in that after each action is taken, you have to tweak some value and move some stocks around. Nevertheless, I enjoy the intrigue of trying to buy and sell in enough of a different pattern than my opponents to gain an advantage.

RATING: 7
A nice, simple economic stock market simulation. Start the game with a few random stocks, then watch the prices go up and down as people buy and sell. Try to time your transactions to maximize your profit, which you use to buy gold and run off to Switzerland!

Seems to do a great job modeling the market but unfortunately, the game is a bit dry and fiddly and the rules (1st version, at least) were pretty horrible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I was very disappointed on this game. It seemed very random in my first play, it doesn't have catch up mechanisms at all given the amount of luck provided and the rules are really a mess.

I played with a single important rule mistake that adds more control to the game and could make it more independent on luck (barely) but I still find it boring, repetitive and very uninteresting. 

Not sure if I want to play it again because the clever market system is obviously under the boring playability.

Played twice on Yucata.de and this game sucks digitally because it needs to be constant, not a turn a day. But, playing "live" makes this game an interesting little Stock Market game. It appeals to me more than Stockpile did which actually surprised me as I was expecting to really like Stockpile.

Would probably give it another try but didn't enjoy it.  The market never got very high and then the prices just dropped.  The price of silver just kept going up so we just ended the game.  Edit:  played again and it was better, not great but not terrible like first play was.

RATING: 7
Buy low, sell high, then flee the market for the safety of gold before the crash.

Probably too luck prone. Potential for stagnation (inherent? groupthink? 5-player?).

The often criticised first edition Rio Grande English rules were actually an homage to William Burroughs: both his family's good fortune in selling off Burroughs Corporation stocks just before the 1929 Wall Street Crash, and to his experimental "cut-up" technique of writing, where the author's thoughts are recorded as words, re-arranged, then left to the reader to extract whatever meaning they can.

Revised rules on RG site are better (though unreadable when printed A4), but they [i]still[/i] omit some details & mention some important info buried in the middle of paragraphs.

Revisited after 2 years, quite a fun game - but only with somebody else responsible for rules explanation & book-keeping.

This looks so promising and the theme is so interesting, but beyond being a fairly complicated teaching tool (complicated for non-gamers) I fail to see the point of this. As a game it seems to fail quite badly. Slightly misjudge when the bubble will burst and you're left with worthless stocks which only continue to decline in value. At that point your options are too hope to ride it out and come last, or sell for next to nothing and come last. 

What a spectacularly uninteresting second half of the game as your decisions are basically to see whether you can afford to buy silver or not. A disappointment.

It is really too bad this game got off to a rocky start with its poor rulebook.  This game is awesome if you like stock market games.  It really gives the feel of speculating (buying low and selling high, and manipulating the market).  The impending crashes add to the excitement.

Be sure to check out the updated rulebook, it fixes all issues w/ the original one that came with the game.

RATING: 8
The game is well designed but every action is followed by some board adjustments and moving pieces. Our game at Essen needed a lot of rulebook referencing. Our second game went much smother and fairly quick (rating went up from 6 to 7), but it will probably take one more game to develop a strategy.

It is purely stock trade and manipulation, so the theme may appear dry to many (and to me as well...) The price changes are influenced by interesting mechanics. If you like the economy engines of Friedemann Friese and do not mind the fiddlyness, this will be a great game for you. This is the pure essence of a market.

Teaches more about market dynamics than you might think.

The more I play it the more I appreciate how different the market dynamics play out and how each group responds differently. Frequently, one player starts selling or buying and the whole group follows in a panic, driving the  stock rates up and down.

Rating increased again (now 8).

Fairly sure we played with the correct rules.  Took far too long (abandoned with silver only just over 50 after 105 minutes), and the shares had already started crashing. Seems counterintuative that the only way for shares to rise in value is to get them in the bag, and the only way to do that is to buy them and add to the purchase table.  However if you all buy them none go in the bag !

To win the game, you have to have a close look on what the others do to be in the position to sell the highest share at the right time, to get the most money, but the silver/gold price will raise, too and you can also winn by buying silver/gold early in the game.

Am holding off on rating until I play this with all the correct rules. My one play had us extending the game 5 or 6 turns past the correct ending, and we only caught when when we all realized we collectively didn't have much to do on our turns.

Update: After playing with the correct rules, I'm still not sure how much I like it. While it does play relatively quickly, market fluctuations are far too random to make any meaningful choices, the only one of consequence being "When do I dump my stock?" While it tries to be clever, the result just isn't very good.

The rules are some of the worst-written I've seen, but once you figure it out it is surprisingly intuitive and clever.  Handling adjustments, shifting briefcases for sales, etc. is also a lot less annoying and fiddly in practice than expected.

RATING: 5.5
Stock market games aren't my forte, but this one caught my interest, especially with all the rules errors (since fixed in downloadable form).

Maybe I just don't get it, but all our 3 plays were extremely similar. To the point of *identical* scores for *both* of us in game 2 and 3, Deb with 4 gold-2 silver to my 4 gold-1 silver. In game 1 Deb managed 4 gold-3 silver, again nearly identical.

You start out with no money, so you take full subsidies. You buy some cheap stock. It rises a bit, you sell some of it to earn some cash and buy silver while it's cheap. Early on, there is no black in the bag, so anything drawn rises. After a while, more and more black goes in the bag, so once you reach level 6 or so, everything is topped out, and pretty much guaranteed to fall after that. I guess I need to see the game played by experts, to see what you're supposed to do. I just don't see how to wring any more points (money) out of the game based on how the silver/stock pricing works.

Strangely byzantine yet at the same time lacking in subtlety or interesting decisions, or at least that's how I feel about it after my one and likely only play. Moreover, I'm increasingly finding that I need stock games to have some additional element beyond just straightforward mechanisms for the rise and fall of stocks. Take as a counterexample Imperial, where stock value is determined by the conflict of nations under majority stockholder control, or Stephensons Rocket, where stock is both determined by the path that railways develop in as well as a currency for influencing said path. Black Friday's mechanisms are by comparison random and gimmicky with relatively little room for players influencing the course of the game. Yet it takes almost as long as these other games to finish.

I don’t know how "pure" of a stock game design this game is, but it certainly feels like a pretty good game, if not a simulation of the stock market.  There’s a good bit of randomness from drawing briefcases from the bag, but the subtle manipulation of the market you make by the buying and selling mechanisms give you some slight control over adjusting your odds, which I find to be pretty darn cool.  I understand the complaints of the fragility of the overall system, and I understand why people are saying that one small mistake in the rules can have a huge effect on the game overall, but it doesn’t bother me.  It reminds me a little bit of Container in that respect.

A game that manages to capture very well the rise and fall of a stock market. There is an higher than normal (normal for these kind of games, anyway) dependence on the luck of the draw, anyway - the briefcases taken from the black bag can effectively make or break your entire game - but this is also a good simulation of the stock market.

Wow, what a disappointment.  An empty gaming experience made even worse by layers of foggy fiddle.

Gripe #1: The timing of each new round - and being able to buy stock at its highest price (and silver at its lowest price) - is of paramount importance, yet the manipulation of said timing is beyond the control of most players.

Gripe #2: Each player's statistically optimal play is often obvious, yet there is no guarantee that a player's "best" move won't lead to disastrous consequences.  

A doozy of a flop, coming to bargain bins near you.

I think this is the worst stock buying / selling game I have ever played. Its simply not intuitively right. Having to sell shares to try and get them into a bag so the price goes up is odd.

Not sure how many shares in the financial world have their price determined by a draw from a bag..

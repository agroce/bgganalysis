OK, in Germany you have to learn and play this game when you go to school.
I missed it.
I am a very poor Skat player (I know the rules but that is not enough to play Skat with German-Skat-People, they will become upset with stupid playing me!).
Therefore no ranking.

Ich habe es nie wirklich gerne gespielt (z.B. zur Schulzeit). Aber man muss die Regeln können, damit man zur Not mit spielen kann. Wobei es dann nur das Problem gibt, daß die echten Skatspieler meistens nicht wirklich Spaß daran haben, wenn so ein unerfahrener (ich kenne nur die Regeln-Mitspieler) als dritter Mann-Zur-Not mitspielt.

A sophisticated trick taking card game for three players with varied scoring options. To do well one must carefully analyze your 10 card hand and judge its scoring possibilities in a variety of ways, then pay careful attention to the bidding to attempt to discern what kind of hands your opponents are holding. Once the trick taking begins more analysis is required as you must remember what has been played and by whom to judge the best time to play your high scoring As and 10s.

The best game ever, if I where allowed only to play a single game for the rest of my life Skat would be it without a moment of hesitation, you simply can't get more game out of just 32 cards.

One of the best 3-player games. Hard to learn, but a time spent on that does pay back in a sheer pleasure coming from a game. Like most card games, it becomes a bit too schematic with time -  even the slightest mistake can be punished painfully, especially if it's a mistake of your teammate... ;)

This game is exlusively for three players. After getting used to the unusual scoring system, it plays very nicely.

While it can be played with a standard deck of cards I am lucky enough to have a Skat deck (32 cards only) with the traditional German suits.

I learnt this with two friends from the Penguin card game book and might have got some rules wrong but..

This is a very interesting game, perhaps a bit too harsh on mistakes and i'm not sure how much real room for to and fro there is in the bidding since some hands are just much easier to lever than others. The actual play is usually just a fairly straight forward trick taking game but where jacks are a suit of trumps of their own. Not entirely sure what to make of it as much of the strategy appeared to go over our heads.

RATING: 6
Standard trick-taking game, with a whole lot of bidding rules.  Only one player can actually score during a round.  I constantly had to refer to the reference sheet to remember the hierarchy of the cards with Jacks, then A, 10, followed by the remaining.

Overall, I didn't care for it as the bidding was fairly complex to me, and it felt like a lot of changes to a standard trick-taking game that didn't have any real purpose, like the 10's being higher than the King, and all the Jacks being still higher.  Although it is a 3-player game which there aren't enough of those.

Played a second time and I liked it a lot better.  Still had to refer to the reference sheets, but much better than my first play.

The "other" traditional German partnership trick-taking game, this one for three players only. Rules may seem somewhat baroque initially, but most of the difficulty comes from the bidding process at the start of a round and while that part is critically important it can be easily blunted when learning the game.

Skat is quite likely one of the most strategic trick-takers around.

I used to be a complete Tichu addict, pulling it out at every possible occasion I could. That was until I learned Skat. 

This is the ultimate trick-taking experience. Trumps are not too numerous or too scarce, just enough to make the game balanced. The same applies to contract options: enough to suit most hands without overloading the game with possibilities. Hands can be calculated to a great extent, but most of them cannot be completely solved - again, just enough to mitigate the game and make it very cerebral without becoming a broken game.

The bidding system, which at first seems unnecessarily convoluted, is actually an ingenious way of measuring the value of your hand without telling exactly what you have. The whole system is a game in itself, with players telling bits of information with every increment - the more you understand it, the more you can read someone's hand through it. Moreover, it allows some flexibility on your decisions, so you can be bidding on two different games of approximate same value at the same time.

The 1-against-2 dynamic is very exciting, especially due to the changing temporary partnerships between hands. Add to this the fact that you can play with either 3 or 4 players, to a flexible but pre-defined number of hands (thus limiting playing time), and you have a winner. 

The only downside is that it is a considerably taxing game when compared to other traditional card games. In comparison, Tichu is much easier to learn, especially for people who have an understanding of Poker hands. I'm not sure there is a way back though - after learning Skat, all other card games feel lacking. 

I am still willing to play Tichu, Schafkopf or Schnapsen at anytime, but would definitely try to pull out Skat first!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Skat is the 3 player (old school trick taking) card game!
Maybe on par or even better then Bridge, since there are no fixed partnerships, but otherwise second best.

No flaws? Sure, it's best enjoyed with 3 equal(ish) level players. Starting hands determines the possibilities, so in a session people can be "(un)lucky". Skat is a matter of who makes less mistakes then the opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very thinky game. The most interesting part is finding out who gets to play alone (and usually to win that round). Still, there is usually some tension in seeing how the round actually plays out - a single tactical error can turn the outcome around.

RATING: 7
A complex bidding & trick-taking game for 3, more complex than Bridge if anything, with arcane scoring. Like all trick takers, it heavily depends on getting a good hand, although the Null bid gives you some options for a VERY bad hand. Defenders have less information to go on than they do in Bridge, but the absence of bidding systems makes the game much more approachable. However it's very much a German game: orderly and safe. With severe penalties for missing contract, conservative bidding is the way to go (although not official, the Ramsch variant improves things a lot here and would increase my rating to 8). For me, the similar Slovenian Tarock is better as the scoring forces you to take risks.

RATING: 8.5
I really like Skat. The first game I was taught in these types of games was Schafkopf which apparently came first (derived from Tarock), then Skat and then Doppelkopf.

All 3 games are very similiar, they all employ standard trick taking with trump, if trump is called.  Where they all differ is player numbers, betting and scoring.  Not surpringly coming from German descent, Skat has a fairly logical but slightly complex bidding/scoring system. Its not that bad really, just more convoluted than it needs to be though I am sure many Germans would scoff at me. 

I like the scoring and what it was trying to do but it just went a little too far in spots, doubling (multiplying) things instead of just adding 10 or 20 points, Grand is so high just for getting dealt the Jacks, etc. The Null seems VERY tough too, maybe it should be one trick so it comes into play more often? but then not really a null anymore.  I like playing Ramsch in the game, where the object is just to have the least points or tricks depending how you play, I played a version of this before in Schafkopf where the loser is punished and the winner is rewarded and liked it a lot, especially if you play it following a round where everyone passes and the same could be done here and is a variant that is played to my understanding. 

Overall Skat is an excellent game for 3 players. I do wish the betting came into play a little more, usually passes happens too quickly and nothing gets bid up very high. I also wish it didn't give such a BIG reward for randomly getting dealt a good hand like many card games do, and focused giving out more points for good play, which many card games miss the mark on.  With a couple tweaks my rating could be a good point higher.   

[u]Update:[/u] 7.5 => 8 I've played a bunch more, and I don't think the scoring is as far off as I thought.  Once in awhile someone scores a crazy big Grand and runs off but a lot of Grands just score about double a normal hand so not bad and often well deserved if you pull it off.  Also, had a couple hands where two players both had good hands and bidding actually became part of the game.  Like Schafkopf (Sheepshead) I also really enjoy this.  

[u]Update:[/u] 8 => 8.5 My rating depends on what version you play, and unfortunately I don't even know technically what version (German but so many variations) I am playing, but its good and addicting. A shorter game would be nice though, I think I will play a slightly tweaked version going forward, like game ends after 15 hands or 250 or 300 points, whichever comes first. The longer game is that way to balance the luck I'm sure but it starts to get too long. I would like to reduce the big bad Grand a little and reward the Nil a little more too, but again this depends on the version you play and I would like to see at least a round of Ramsch every 5 rounds, or at least the ability to call one instead of the null/nil just at a reduced reward.

More of a religion than a game in some parts of Germany. If you don't know all the hidden do's and dont's, you get in trouble with your partner fast.

RATING: 6
Trick-taking for three players, naturally with German suits. Seems to demand quite a lot of rounds since only the bidding player gets any points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Germany's national treasure is possibly the deepest three-hand trick taking game on the face of Earth due to a convoluted auction system that allows rounds to be played for a vast range of points, regardless of the different values of the same cards depending on the type of round played (something not too infrequent in harder card games, actually). Especially striking is the use of Jacks as driving force of the auctions and as über-trumps.

It must be said that Skat has got a very steep learning curve, and that being a game for two partners against a lone player it can be frustrating to discover its tactical intricacies (if not for the learning player it will be for their partner!). Luckily modern technology can help:

Once over that hurdle there is a sublime, varied game that always offers new surprises.

Trick taking games don't get any better than this one. I've played thousands (yes, thousands) of hands without getting bored even one single time. Best 3 player game ever.

RATING: 7
A very solid bidding & trick-taking game, ideal for 3 players who play well. Good hands, bad hands, it's about ekeing out every advantage and maximising your score through practised bidding over a series of hands, and that will gradually whittle away the luck aspect.

2014-09-21: Raised this from 7 to 10. I finally played this with two other players who were willing to slog through the seemingly convoluted scoring and bidding system. We also played with won cards face up so we can better count cards. In this trick-taking game, every card played counts! 

2011-11-20: Very logical yet messy bidding system; I had to create tables as player aids.

This is a great 3 player card game. The rules seem arcane but are actually reasonably logical. Non-Germans seem to struggle with the bid not representing directly what you must win. The play is very good, with the large numbers of trumps and the Skat meaning that the declarer can pull off interesting manouevres in many hands. The counting Matadors with/without and the possibility of losing through finding a matador in the Skat are strikes against it, but otherwise a very good game.

Quite complex German(?) trick taking game. Quite unique mechanism that the right to play what suits your hand best is auctioned off before the game starts. I was never a big fan of Skat, but with a couple of friends in a Pub this is fine.

Very good, traditional card game from Germany. A lot of people have problems in the beginning with some of the rules, but it is really easy once you get it. Really a classic game, which you can play over and over. I played it for around 3 or 4 years every day on the ride back home from school. And it is very cheap, you just need a standard card deck with 32 cards (each color from 7 to Ace).

I used to think it was a: Wonderful game for three that can be played anywhere you have five minutes to spare for another hand. I never tire of it. It's not just about winning the trick, but also about how to maximise your points through the bidding. Amongst players of equal skill the winner in the long run is the one who maximises their points with clever bidding. That said, I think I prefer Die Sieben Siegel or Sticheln because they don't involve partnerships in the way Skat does. If you like the partnership aspect of Tichu then Skat will most likely appeal to you too.
Now I think the partnership aspect of it annoys me to much. I've changed. I prefer games where I can play my own game the way I want to. Milage may vary.

We had many good pub nights with this back in the day :-)

Very good 3 player trick taking game.

I think it's better, and more complex, than Euchre, so if you like Euchre and actually are willing to try other games (something I find most Euchre players are not, in fact, willing to do)... I think you will find this one rewarding.

By the same token, I think it's a poor man's Bridge in terms of complexity and depth to the game.  That's not a big knock though because this one is either to get your teeth into and you don't have to have a couple years experience with your partner to be able to play.

I'd put close to Tichu as well in terms of an enjoyable trick taking game that's confusing at first and fun once you get it.  Probably hard to find rules/players for a lot of people.

Classic German 3 handed point trick game that has a hodge podge of various bids with various goals and various points denominations that will likely turn off some. Even the Germans cant agree on what is the basic classic version as everyone has their own preferred bidding variants and scores. Probably on the decline.

Unfortunately, this rating is based on play against various computer opponents only. I have yet to get a group together willing to learn the game. That said, I'm fascinated by the way in which you can push the limits of your hand in order to bid higher. The constantly shifting alliances are wonderful. There is also joy in pulling off a questionable bid by just a few points. My only complaint is the seemingly inflated value of Grand bids.

Update: I spent months playing in a weekly (or bi-weekly) game. So much enjoyment! I love this game, and wish I again had an opportunity for regular play with a dedicated group.

A traditional trick-taking card game that I feel is overly dictated by the deal - there's too much reward for a powerhouse hand.  The game's scoring seems backwards to me - mediocre play with a great hand is rewarded more than great play with a mediocre hand.  The scoring doesn't compensate risk-taking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a fun game. However, it's kind of illogic that someone who has the better cards is rewarded more points for a game than someone who plays a risky game. 

Well, back then they didn't refine game mechanics. Anyways this is our "generations"-game. I used to play it a lot with my father and grandfather. And still do whenever i'm back home.

Many of those old games that are older than the industry (chess, bridge, but not Monopoly and Scrabble and so) have a worldwide following and are very deep. But they don't have as high rankings on BGG. I often wonder why this is. And whether new games will become as deep in playing when they've been around for centuries.

I don't master Skat deeply. Not much sense to play it against German Skat nerds, to them I just make ridiculous mistakes. A proper Skat player plays the cards he gets dealt flawlessly. (Maybe that's the reason why they aren't ranked high.)

I rather enjoy Skat because I still have to try to make the best decision with every card I play. And I admire games like Skat for their resonance, I mean the fact that they gather a huge following and have done it for centuries.

DAS ultimtaive Kartenspiel. Unser Familienspiel, es wird immer wieder gespielt wenn ich zu Hause bin und meine Eltern besuche. Für drei Leute eigentlich ein grandioses Kartenspiel, das man wirklich überall spielen kann, wo man ein Kartenspiel hat.Allein das Reizen hat schon eine besondere Magie und es sind wirklich schöne Momente wenn man ein knappes Spiel doch noch durchgebracht hat, oder aber auch wenn man ein sicheres Spiel dann doch noch umgebogen hat. Es macht mit gleichwertigen Spielern einfach mehr Spass als die meisten Brettspiele.

This is a skill-rewarding traditional card game for 3 players. Defence is the greater challenge and the most fun.  Newcomers may find the rules strange and complex, but it's worth the effort to master them. After many plays (mostly unrecorded) I'm a bit burnt out on this one.

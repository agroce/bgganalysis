Looked forward to this ever since I saw it up for preorder but it falls short of the Gamers usual high standards of production. The counters are blurry and off center in my copy which seems to be a complaint in a few areas. 

Having said that lots of scenarios as usual and the designer is committed to putting more up.Lots of support on Consimworld as well. 

The scenarios are varied and interesting. Nice variants too. Shame about the production.

The POP-style VC require the Soviet player (in particular) to grab locations every turn. The pressure to do so is quite relentless, with little tolerance for failure, and if the Soviet player gets behind the curve, it can be difficult to get out of the VP hole. 

The German can frustrate this by putting 16-4-3 infantry divisions in the POP locations, especially the Minor Cities, which are Very Close terrain and contain air bases. The Ju-52 can fly from the Luftlotte box into a city and deliver 2T every turn, picking it up directly from G, which is considered the same location for transport of air cargo per the errata. This will keep at least one division from rolling for attrition (2T for 4RE). Even those without supply will stand a good chance to survive attrition rolls on the AR4 column.

How to counter this? The Minor Cities can be hard to effectively barrage by air, and assaulting them can be expensive in terms of SP for the Soviets: a 40-factor assault typically requires four 10-strength, AR3 divisions (2 steps each); this will generate usually around 5:1 odds against a 8-strength AR4 German division (assuming half-strength due to OOS but not DG), and in Very Close terrain. Such a German division can simply sit in the hex and take any options as Step Losses, and deny the hex to the Soviets for at least two turns (supplying its defense with Internals, assuming it's surrounded and doesn't have its own cache of SP). 

While the Soviet armored formations are beautiful to behold, they are better at surrounding the cities than assaulting them, and more expensive SP-wise to move and to attack. Perhaps the biggest mistake the German player can make is to retreat, especially southeast of Riga, where exposure on the Open terrain will let those Soviet armored units do what they do best.

Repeated in several cities, this German stand-and-die tactic can deny a large chunk of POP to the Soviet player for two turns--more if the German manages to truck, rail, throw, or fly SP into such cities; if the German manages to roll just average on attrition rolls; if the Soviet player botches those attacks. Hedgehogs make them even stronger against barrages and direct assaults.  The German player should consider using 2SP for a L1 Hog, and another 1SP for combat supply or eating off the map.

Perhaps the only way the Soviet can defeat this strategy is to get to the cities first, and so the game may often come down to who moves first. Attrition and initiative rolls don't make for fun determinants of victory in OCS, but if the game gets past that, BG has the potential to be great, with elite German armored divisions clashing with elite Soviet ones in a mini-Kursk. 

Unfortunately, it often won't, based on my own and others' experiences, as BG seems to lead to either very frustrated Soviet players, stymied and defeated by initiative rolls, or very frustrated German ones, steamrollered and defeated by initiative rolls. The promise of the game is 1- or 2-point VP swings per turn over POP locations, and if that happens, I'm sure BG can be a lot of fun. 

On a production note, I'll never understand why north is not "up" on the map. This seems like a Wargaming 101 fail. If players want to turn the maps to suit their tables, they'll turn the maps, but please, always, always make north "up."

AS I type these lines, I have my first game in progress.

You have no idea how many times I was lying in my bed trying to sleep but in stead just couldn't stop thinking about my next move. 

Playing the Germans here against an experienced Russian. It is brutal. The Russians are so powerfull. Somewhere you know you should be retreating toward those rivers but you just don't want to give him all those victory cities without at least a good fight. Only facing more potential doom when they do break through your line and start to pocket your army.

What a game this is. This is the 3rd game of OCS I have ever played and so far all games just were a blast. I have to admit, I have become an addict :p

A game that falls right into the mainstream of the OCS series without being unmanageably large.  It fits onto two 22"x34" maps and has reasonably high unit density.  At the start of the campaign, there's a solid front in the north and a breach in the south, so players have a chance to experience both types of action.

RATING: 8
This game provides an excellent perspective on the various dilemmas faced by the Axis and Soviet forces in an asymmetric late-war campaign. The Soviets have an enormous ability to absorb losses, but never have enough supply and risk overrunning their supply lines. The Germans are suffering from serious attrition, but retain enough punch to punish an overly aggressive opponent.

Still feeling a little dubious on the victory conditions, which tend to reward the Axis side for hunkering down. An organized retreat is much more difficult than throwing up roadblocks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good: WWII Eastern Front - Operational - Heavy

Plus:
-Original theme: Baltic Gap. This is not meant to be balanced in a way that the Germans are capable of launching a serious offensive. This is about the desperate struggle to retreat AGN from the Baltic states. 
-High investment payoff; the more time you invest, the more rewarding. The OCS system is one of the most realistic yet playable operational systems. 
-Although detailed, it is not process heavy and intuitive.  
-It has a H. Graf Strachwitz (see my avatar) counter! That means it must be very evocative. 
-Good mix of scenario's

Minus:
-One sided nature of the scenario's 
-The map text is facing West, not North. Strange why this is done but it is useful for the Russian player
-OCS is actually quite intuitive but with a lot of bookkeeping so only suitable if you can spend a day or weekend playing. I enjoy the system but you have to invest in it. Investment pays off as you mgain experience but I am not convinced yet this title is a good pay off. 
-Map is functional but nothig special; I know it's design for pure funtionality and it really does do a good job but a more evocative map would have been welcome (like 1914: Twilight in the East)
 
Sofar I did not get warm with OCS but I can't put my finger on it. 
I don't like the maps and counters (I much prefer GMT's Battle for Normandy counters and maps). As for the system, maybe I should play it with an OCS expert to win me over.

Great OCS addition and finally a more manageble one.
It is a good entry into OCS from the perspectives that it is only a 2 mapper and only has 840 counters, but on the other hand due to the 'one sided' nature of the theme and scenario's it might not be a good entry; this title is great in depicting the 1944 Baltic situation but the German player hardly get's to attack. I guess Tunisia remains the best OCS entry but you can't go wrong with Burma.

The 9 is for the OCS system. This particular title is great as it is manageable compared to Case Blue and Guderian's Blitzkrieg. I am looking forward to the next, hopefullymnagable OCS titles. 

Russian 'steam roler' with Germans trying desperately to delay the advance. Balance is not an issue for me and I love the German challenges (see Red Storm against the Reich from Compass Games).

Great if you are looking for a serious operational game on the Eastern Front. 

Grognards only. i still haven't embraced OCS and not sure why. I am not a fan of the maps and counter art. I have not given up on OCS yet but maybe should play it with an expert.

Perhaps one of the greatest OCS games I've played, I haven't yet played the campaign, but some of the inovations in victory conditions and catch up mechanics, add significant tension. While time will tell on the brilliance of this game, so far all signs point to awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game system is excellent and the conflict itself is interesting, but the victory conditions are absolutely insane. I haven't done the math, but to beat them as Soviet it seems that the German has to evacuate all his positions while having no real urge to do so. The Soviet player lacks the resources to keep up with the crazy time table. Either the scenario designer severly underrates the Red Army (as most US game designers are want to do), or he's severly underrated Hitler's influence on the historical outcome. I find it strange that despite acknowledging this himself in the notes, he sees no reason to add any difficulties to the Germans to simulate the debacle that the real life campaign was. To me, this is extremely weak game design which seems to assume that the German player should withdraw just because that's what happened. This game seriously needs the "Humeur de Hitler"-counter from Victory Roads.

This is my favorite OSG game yet as the terrain and situation are intense.

Played the campaign game and my opponent forfeited the game in July 8th turn.  I got some good luck and the Germans defended too far forward and I was able to get behind his lines and cut his supplies so far back that he could not even do a breakout.

As the Germans, I strongly suggest you defend in depth with strong reserves as the game can be very unforgiving to the Germans.

The Russians get so many replacements that the practically speaking don't need to worry about casualties.

Would love to play the Germans some time to see if the game is unbalance or not.

My first OCS title - and I was blown away.  I played deep into the campaign twice solitaire before venturing into the VASSAL OCS community which is an order of magnitude better.

This is intense - hard decisions all the time.  No respite for either player.  Smooth rules which push all the game time into decision making not rules reading.  Highly evocative of the 1944 Red Army offensive in the north.

As the beginning of my love for OCS this will always be a special game for me.

Preliminary ranking based on initial run-through.  This looks to be a very nice addition to the OCS repertoire.  Not only are the Germans on the run here, but they're being hotly pursued by a superior Russian force!

The front is nice and narrow, so it allows for more focused play than other Russian Front games.  (But it remains a fully saturated, solid front.)  Judging by the countermix and initial setup, it looks like this game is very infantry-heavy, but with some really potent armored units to create schwerpunkts and exploit breakthroughs.  Not to mention the most powerful artillery ever seen in OCS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably one of the best if not the best operational level ruleset. Just the right OCS size for me. Lots of depth and the 4.0 rules are very streamlined and clear. It shows that there has been lots of work and feed back. Definitely not as complicated as some people think. This one has a bunch of smaller scenarios which is a big plus.

This game is an outstanding choice in the OCS series. It is smaller than the monsters CB or GBII (only two maps) and it is Superior for solitaire play. It also has plenty of One-Map scneraios.

Anyone who gave this OCS game a 10 must be utterly brain washed by MMP.  This is by far the most horribly unbalanced of all the OCS games yet published.  It is a complete stomping of a weak German Army by a Russian juggernaut that is dominant on the ground and in the air.  A German player has very slim to no chance against a competent Russian player in the Campaign Game.  The German can do no more than set up one bowling pin after another for the Russian Army to bowl over and that is supposed to be fun for the German player??   Even the designer seems to have known this, why else include all the "hypothetical" German reinforcements.  The Russians don't get any "hypothetical" reinforcements. I have played the campaign game once, seen it played at Monstercon, and I have a friend who has played the campaign twice, all four games resulted in crushing Russian victories.  Skip this one OCS fans, you won't miss a thing.

I own every single OCS game starting with GB/OCS 1.0 and this is the first time I feel ripped off, well maybe the second, DAK2 was close.  In my opinion MMP is taking advantage of the OCS reputation by publishing poor titles like Baltic Gap.  I think it's time to retire the OCS series if this is all that's left to put out.

A very interesting worker-placement game.  Feels like a lot more player interaction than other games of the genre.  Several interesting mechanics combine for a very cohesive game.  Only complaint is that the phases can end very quickly, so it is easy to end up a turn (or even an action) short of doing something, then having to start fresh in the next phase.

+ Introduces an interesting spacial element with the mine shaft; Nice balance between investing your resources for future returns and saving for end game scoring.
- Feels quite a bit like most other worker-placement games.


Why it's previously-owned:
Yet another in the over-populated worker placement category for me.  It's a really interesting game that I really like, and I never would have traded it I think.
But, I gave this one away to my friend to help him have a worthy game collection.

Good worker placement euro game. Nice implementation of the unique yet weird theme. Players are miners at a salt mine in medieval Poland competing for the most gold at the end of the game. There are no victory points here. Quite a lot of player interaction. There is no new innovative mechanic. The game flows well and money is tight.

This isn't a worker-placement. It's a really cool resource-management game where players can wedge themselves in-between acquisition and delivery, getting rich off of the prosperity of others... really dynamic, lots of neat simple mechanisms interacting. love it.

Gyakorlatilag a játéknak nincs olyan összetevője, ami legalább a kielégítő szintet elérte volna.
Régen untam (talán soha) ilyen mértékben játékot közel három órán keresztül.
A játék arra alkalmas igazán, hogy elijesszen embereket a társasjátékozástól.
Béna szabályok, kiegyensúlyozatlan felszerelés kártyák, ötlettelen megoldások tömkelege - mind a kivitelezésben, mind a játék folyamatában, mindezt cca. 3 órán keresztül.
Igazán a "soha többet" kategóriában a helye...!

RATING: 6
This is a very enjoyable eurogame, without any new mechanic, but where everything fits nicely together and the gameplay is smooth, solid and with just the right duration.
I can't tell how many paths to victory are viable, but the game seems worthy of some exploration at least: the number of meaningful decision seems quite right for such a small game.
Furthermore, it is definitely more interactive than lots of the late euros with worker placement as central mechanic...
The production value is average: the main board is nicely illustrated, but (in my copy at least) it rapidly got warped, while the other components are quite anonymous.
The initial rating is a 7, and it can raise if the game shows longevity and diversity in ways to win, or it can go down if some of the most fragile parts (balance of the tool cards, among others) will show actual brokenness...

RATING: 5
After the first phase I was rather positive but after a while my enthousiasm was going down. The market wasn't used untill the last few turns of the third phase, the tools can be used only once per phase, so the advantage of such a tool is gone soon. felt like it hasn't been tested enough.

Good spin on worker placement. The mine mechanic is really fascinating. You need to balance getting your guys to the spot first with exhausting them to get the salt out. This can lead to some really cut throat maneuvering for salt. Tool tiles seemed to be a little swingy (some overpowered and some not so much). The timing mechanism to present your salt to the king was also handled well. I can see this perhaps getting a little stagnant with the same mine tiles. I would love to get my hands on the expansion at some point for some much needed variety.

Not a bad game, a reasonably tight worker placement game with some solid mechanics and the right amount of chaos and screwage. 

What soured it a little for me is that there seemed to be a lot of decisions about "I need to pay this money to one player, should I give it to player A or player B?" In games like this the winner tends to be the player who pleads best, or whines most rather than the person who makes the best moves. OK, in this case that winner was me, but do you know what? I would rather win by making the best moves.

Not really worker placement in the standard sense. You dont really claim actions with them, they are mostly used in the mines to dig out the salt. Some standard things going on, but in a good way. The game feels pretty tactical and is mostly about timing and positioning.

There is a lot of game here in a relatively small package. Some tough decisions to make particularly with planning your place in the castle queue. Seems to scale well and played well with three.

A dull eurogame where you buy a worker, collect cubes and turn them into points in the end. Nothing really new here and there's nothing that would save the game. Cool theme and/or components might have done it but both are the same old in this case.

There's definitely a lot of gamers who love the game but it's just not my thing.

Only played once. Solid Euro with lots of options and several ways to score points. The water system means that it's difficult to mine successfully with your two actions without giving an advantage to freeloaders who have followed you in. I like money as VPs though.

Hey look, it's a worker placement game!

I am getting very sick of new euro worker placement games, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game didn't bore me to death.   

I guess there's just enough minor innovations to keep it interesting.   Without the purchasable tiles this would probably be a pretty dull game, but the tiles really open up your options and give you some interesting combo moves.

More tactical than strategic, due to the many hidden tiles. Difficult and interesting optimization and timing tasks, which slow the game down a bit towards the end, though. The theme is represented quite nicely for a Euro-Game.

RATING: 6.5
Cube mining and delivery to the royal palace; not the most exciting of themes, but it works well enough.  However it seemed to take an inordinate length of time to play (and this from someone who's played Dominant Species twice in the last month!) - certainly it was far too long for what it is.  Maybe it's just us or maybe it was the same first time syndrome which afflicted Caylus - if, like it, it's playable in half the time with further plays it would be worth an extra mark or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I thought the game was pretty fun, although I will caution against reading too much into the listed mechanisms for this game.  It's only kinda-sorta a worker placement/pick-up and deliver/economic game.  The elements are very very slightly visible, but I'm not sure there's enough there to classify it as any of those.  I initially picked up the game because I tend to like all of these things, but while I still enjoyed the game, it really doesn't have much of any of those elements.

Essentially, you're sending miners to mine you some salt, which you try and cash in in specific sets, dictated by tiles that tell you which sets are currently in demand.  There are quite a few other ways to make money though (which is how you win the game) such as being an assistant at various buildings (you get money every time someone uses the building), buying/selling cubes at the market, and getting paid to assist other people in delivering their salt to the surface (each mined salt needs a continuous chain of men to get it to the surface; if you form part of the chain, you get paid).

Overall, I thought it was a fun game, but the game is rather same-y from game to game, which although I had a decent time playing, means it's really only good for a play a year or so for me.

[i]1 play. 
2 players.[/i] 

Its often frustrating to play a game like [thing=73316]Magnum Sal[/thing].  The design screams of wasted potential.  That's not to say that the remaining game isn't worthwhile -- it's an eminently tolerable light-middleweight Euro.  And, of course, the small-publisher label and quirky theme do contribute a certain charm to this effort by an up-and-coming design team.  But the real hook for gamers comes in several semi-novel mechanics that at once both fascinate and yet obviously and consistently remind of what could have been. 

Magnum Sal's gameplay centers on placing meeples to explore an underground Polish salt mine.  Exploration is limited by "the chain rule," a restriction on the movement of any mines in the mines in a way that would sever the continuous chain of workers leading to the surface.  The chain rule is perhaps paradigmatic of Magnum Sal's mechanics: the fascination derives from regular, if minor, risk/reward tensions and the facilitation of potentially interesting (and even mean-spirited) player interaction.  For example, one player can use the chain rule to easily neutralize a large number of another player's workers simply by placing a single worker who extends the chain in a meaningless or unhelpful way.  In a two-player game, these kind of tactics can be especially brutal.  (Based on anecdotal evidence with a sample size of two, and despite my utter disdain for the term, I'll warn that this is probably not a "significant-other-friendly" game.)

But the fascination is quickly replaced by frustration as Magnum Sal cuts short any long-term strategic potential that mine movement might otherwise have offered by artificially dividing the game into three "weeks" of mining, each of which begins with a completely reset board state.  Had the game been a single, continuous event, the moderate level of interaction and subtle strategies involved in mine movement might well have resulted in something akin to an oddly thematic [thing=43015][/thing].  The three-week structure certainly undermines that. 

Although the weeks themselves hold some potential for tactical round-length jockeying, that aspect of the game would be exponentially more interesting if round length were meaningfully tied to the value of strategic investment opportunities (as in another quirky Spiel '10 release, [thing=75212]Grand Cru[/thing]).  Salt, however, doesn't depreciate; the game's only market is stunted and inelegant; and turns feel abundant.  The opportunity to control round length, then, involves little more than waiting to catch an opponent in a temporarily unfavorable position, rather than a meaningful part of a particular strategic path.  This is little compensation for the negative repercussions of the three-week structure.

I won't rehash my general sentiment against special-power combo-building, but I will note that the Magnum Sal is further weakened by plentiful tool cards that all-too-cheaply enable players to break the game's rules.  Usually, the cost of the tool is little more than the VP value of the tool at game end, while the benefits over even a single use will probably justify the action cost of the purchase.  Perhaps there's more here, so I'll repeat the refrain that these are initial (and hence [i]tentative[/i]) conclusions.

Magnum Sal has the potential to be richer, deeper, and more captivating game with tweaks to many of the same mechanics.  That was clearly not the designers' intention, and consequently I think the game straddles an odd ground in its genre.  If viewed as a middleweight economic game with reasonably strong spatial elements and opportunities for ruthless play, it is easily overshadowed by last year's unheralded [thing=43152][/thing] (see [thread=515622]my review[/thread] for reasons why).  Rather, what remains of the gamer's game that could have been is merely a decent and beneficial, if minor, step up in complexity from [thing=34635]Stone Age[/thing] (the game whose feel Magnum Sal most evokes for me).  

If you are primarily a lightweight and/or middleweight gamer, Magnum Sal might be worth a shot.  But to a heavier gamer, the obviousness of the missed opportunities makes playing the game that ultimately was made less enjoyable that it really ought to be.

RATING: 6.5
In serious need of "Salt Mining Lite" variant since it is too long for what it is. Too much tactics, not enough strategy for a game that takes 2.5 hours and is decided by the caprices of the last phase.

RATING: 8
This game has the potential to really grow on me with repeated plays.  It is a kind of worker placement game, but the workers don't really activate actions or block other players, they just form a chain and hopefully net you some money (points).  They can also mine salt that turns into even bigger points.  Nothing too revolutionary, but what is there is solid.

Rating after 1 play. Props for the theme. Mechanics work pretty well within the theme, especially the actual mining part. Water subtracting from workers collection capacity and pumping water seem ripped straight from Tinner's Trail. But since multiple players can have miners in the same spot, there's a mini game of chicken for who will pump the water. I was way too agressive the first game and tried to dig deep solo too early, which was a ton of wasted actions. Would like to play again.

RATING: 6
(Played at Spiel 2010.) A no-nonsense worker placement game built around an old salt mine in Poland. If you're familiar with the ‘playing the board’ experience of Cuba or World Without End or..., then the part of Magnum Sal which takes place above ground is very easy to grasp, and as such nothing particularly special. What I rather liked were the ideas which went into the functioning of the salt mine itself, which is conveniently located underneath the board. Although here too there is nothing truly unusual, the rules create some good fights between players, if necessary aided by some technology which is available above ground. I hadn't expected to like this game as much as I eventually did, even if it contains, as many commenters have already noticed, nothing truly special. However, the smooth gameplay of Magnum Sal [i]is[/i] something you don't see every day, and that is a little special.

I didn't really know whether or not to bring a copy home with me, and in the end decided against it (my partner had a few doubts too), but it was a border case. I'm keeping my eye on this title, and if further reports keep on mentioning in my opinion favourable things, I may purchase it still.

[b]Update[/b] I was able to give this game another go in a relaxed setting so I could form a better opinion on it. This time I played with four, and could admire to some extent the smoothness of the design. As I indicated there is nothing truly remarkable about it, but neither does it do anything wrong either. Gameplay is quick and pleasant, although we did run into a bit of a logistical quagmire in the second phase of the game. At that point valuable salt is brought to the surface, and players have to decide whether to attempt to bring it to the King, or to wait for the third phase to start in order to finish the game ASAP. This part felt a little... cramped of sorts. There wasn't much to do here, and the limit of two actions meant that opening up a new chamber for mining purposes meant that it drew the other miners like flies to flypaper. But considering how quickly the last phase went I think the overall impression remains somewhat positive on average. I have removed the game from my wishlist as my partner and I deemed it merely 'okay' which no longer suffices to enter the collection; but at the same time the rate remains unchanged: Magnum Sal to me is the archetype '6'-game.

I really dislike winning my first play of a game, because I know I'm not that much more clever than the others, so the fault must be with the game. The easiest way to win seems also to be the least interesting. I would prefer a game which challenges players to find a clever way to win.

This is a particularly interesting worker placement game with a refreshingly different theme: salt mining. (The theme is integrated very tightly with the gameplay... this is not a pasted on theme.)

Explore deeper and deeper into the mine, using tools acquired previously. You must pay other players' workers who help carry your salt up from the depths of the mine.

Good one.

EDIT: after several plays, I'd rate the 4-player game an '8', but the 2-player game is only a '6'.

EDIT 2: The Magnum Sal: Muria expansion very nicely improves this game (and adds a 5th player). It increases the game's length, but it's actually worth it. Bumping my rating up a little.

Interesting game but not sure I like the mechanic.  This game would have been fine 15 years ago, but there are just so many better games out there now.  It is pretty standard stuff of collecting cubes and converting it to VPs/money. This one is very luck dependent.  And by that I mean that other players can screw you out of cubes through no strategic fault of your own.  You have to pick your fights, but sometimes there are simply none that you can win. Now that I have one play under my belt, I wouldn't mind trying it again.  I'd probably focus on the workshop tiles since those provide a strategic advantage since they appear the only way to prevent getting screwed out of cubes.

Really nice Euro design.  No complex conversions of materials to victory points here - your gold is your points, and I love that.  The economy escalates very nicely over the course of the game.  The game has a lot of direct competition mixed with some grudging cooperation.  The game lacks a lot of the convoluted mechanics I have seen in many Euros lately.  It's not too hard to figure out how to accomplish your goals, so you can focus on outmaneuvering your opponents.  My main reservation is I wonder how much replay value the game has, but I'd be happy to play this any time to find out.

A pretty straightforward worker placement game where the primary actions don't actually require you to place workers.  So maybe it is an action selection game at heart?   In any case, the theme is actually pretty well implemented, even if salt mining in Poland isn't the most riveting concept for a game.  The water mechanism reminds me a little of Tinner's Trail.   Might be a good game to buy if you don't already have 5 other games like it.

Played my first game of Magnum Sal complete with the Muria expansion, which is a must. This is a great game with a worker placement mechanism. Not dissimilar to Viticulture in feel but a lot lot better in its execution. You are fulfilling orders for salt from the mines, similar to the wine orders you fulfil in Viticulture. But here you have a very clever system to extract the salt from the mines. You need to get deep in the mines, but in order to do so you need the help of fellow player's workers to help get down the mine. This interesting dynamic of competitive cooperation makes for a really interesting game.

I bought this game from Essen 2011 based on the quick brief they gave about the game at the publisher's booth. And it was a good purchase.
There is just enough tough choices and game works mechanically well.

Seems to be best if played with 3 players because then everyone can be starting player at once. And maybe the most recommended spot to place a meeple at every beginning is the card shop.

Magnum Sal is, for the most part, a pretty standard worker placement and resource conversion game. The most interesting deviation from the usual formula is that placement in the mine has a strong spatial component. Unfortunately, the potential created by this change is somewhat squandered by the full board reset after each of the three rounds, making it a game of fleeting commitments rather than one of strategic development.
While the game works alright as is I also cannot help but think that the market could have been used for better effect and wonder whether the cheap tools are really properly balanced with the rest of the game.

One of the most interesting and underrated economic games (judging from relatively low ranking here on BGG) in my collection. The designer successfully combines both a good economic model with elegant play mechanics that are very thematic. I especially like the rules of placing/moving miners (cannot break the 'chain' to the surface) and the competition for castle orders.

Ok. So, the game is good. Even very good. Alhough, a major problem was the length of our first game. For all the things that you do in the game it took too much time. Probably a board with a track of your money would be better than constatnly getting and counting new coins.

It's the first game for very long time that made me think of it a day after the first game, which is a sign of a good design.
On the other hand I'm worried about the replayabality - there are not that many paths to victory, and some moves are forced by the opoonent. We shall see.
I am also eager to check how does the game work with the expansion.

Magnum Sal is a 2 to 4 player worker placement game.
Each player send worker in the mine to extract salt and complete royal order to gain money.  Extracting salt from the mines is what makes this game interesting.  There must always be a chain of worker from the farthest miner to the top.  When extracting salt, you have to pay for each space where you don't have a miner to one of the player who have a miner.
At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.

Tidy Euro, nice artwork and wonderful theme. There is a bit of variation due to each game having random tool cards removed. On my first play I liked it. We included the expansion and I don't see it ever getting played without that. I'd rate it higher but our hobby really isn't crying out for another worker placement game and I don't get anything like the plays I should out of the games I already know. Feb 2013

Oh no, another WP game!? Well, I don't mind and this one isn't a pure WP game anyway.

Using meeplechains to get the goods more cheap, sending out meeples to get to the king 2 rounds later and buying new stuff to make everything easier sounds similar? Yeah it does (mostly), however, this game works differently and due to this, it's another great WP style game.

By current Eurogame standards this is a fairly straightforward game, you mine and sell salt, there's no maximising one quantity while minimising another as you get in games like Notre Dame. It's essentially worker placement, but you can run out of useful actions towards the end of a 'week' and it certainly pays to know which combinations of goods are going to be in demand at the start of the final round. Scoring tends to be close so paying others to carry your salt out of the mine can decide the winner. Solid, but not a classic.

Magnum Sal is fairly thematic game based on  a worker-placement type of mechanic with a twist - the latter being the mining element that is the core of the game. Despite relatively simple rules, Magnum Sal requires a considerable amount of thought to play well, as for every move you need to calculate how much money (i.e. victory points) you will gain and how many you will give to your opponents. The game is highly interactive as most actions will impact not just on you but also on one or more of the other players. The tool cards are a nice touch as they can be used in combination to sneakily mine salt from under the noses of other players.

Worker placement with an interesting spatial component. So far, it's been worthy of its few plays. During the third round, when the big points are to be scored, you'll need to evaluate and play your position well to succeed.

That said, for what it is, it does seem a little long. I also think that the between-round resets feel a little TOO severe.

Lots of similarities to "Tinner's Trail" in theme (mining) as well as needing to deal with water (both have pumps and other tools to deal with it).  This newer entry also brings in worker placement into that theme.  The marketplace doesn't seem to be that useful until end game (to sell cubes not used).

RATING: 5
Well, in terms of mechanics it works reasonably well, but it doesn't really offer anything new over all the other action selection / worker placement games. If anything, this devolves into even more fiddly micro-management than is usually seen in these games, and as a result it takes a long time to play.

I didn't buy it, and after playing it, I didn't regret that decision.

RATING: 7
There's nothing wrong with Magnum Sal, but I have a lukewarm impression of it.  This might be the game to have brought home my fatigue with worker placement.  Which is a little unfair to the game I suppose; it has some unique elements like a spatial focus to the miner placement, and costs that actually make whether to buy another worker a real decision.

Salt Mining in Poland. It's a theme that's quite difficult to sell. It's a solid if not spectacular game. Board looks very similar in style to Stone Age, but it does not play like it. One of the players in my first game described it as Caylus light.

Potentially a good midweight game of resource gathering and point-conversion. Pretty sure this is nothing spectacular but the logistics of mining, investment in infrastructure (tools / more workers), and timing of orders all comes together well enough. Would play again but don't expect it to catch on.

Magnum Sal: Muria (Multilingual first edition) (2012)

This is an under-appreciated gem of a worker placement game. And it's one that is perfectly integrated with its theme. Imagine, a true Eurogame in which the theme is not pasted on! The "worker chain" mechanic that links your workers in the mine to all the other workers in the mine is just brilliant. And there are even multiple paths to victory in Magnum Sal. I've seen games won in which the winning player hardly mined at all, but simply capitalized on all the other actions on the board. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because of the components. They are sub-par. That's my only complaint about this otherwise fantastic game.

Good one. Outstanding graphics and pieces quality for a Polish game. The same applies for rules, except that I was confused at the end - everybody got quite the same amount of points and the winner was just lucky to have one more point for something - accidentally... I have to give it another try.

And the Caylus references, especially in graphics design are quite obvious - but it's rather in game's advantage I suppose.

Enjoyable worker placement game where you seek to mine out salt to fulfill contracts and/or sell for money.  The infrastructure takes time to build and you will generally use other people's miners to help transport your salt which will cut into your profits.  I'm not sure I really like the aspect of the game that clears all your workers from the mines at the end of each day - I understand that the day is over and they are going home to rest, but I didn't much care for having to set up my miner network all over again each round.

12/06/11 Played a three-player game.
Magnum Sal gains a point for having a unique theme. However said theme and game are as dry as, as, as, Salt! Sure, its all logical, but I can't say mining salt fired my imagination. The game lasts three major turns, all basically the same. There is no culmination of effort. Each turn is just more of the same. So I guess it *is* much like toiling in a salt mine, day after day, with no end in sight. The coins are so small its hard to pick them up. And why 3's and no 10's? And what the heck is green and brown salt anyway? Even though the salt gallery tiles are slightly rearranged each game, I see little reason to think subsequent games would be much different. Everyone is basically doing the same thing each game. There's no real way to specialize. So it turns into a game of micro-management, hoping someone else will make a mistake you can take advantage of. I'd play it again, but I hope for not at least nine months. Right now I can't see ever playing it more than three times total. Needs more Cowbell.

A very easy fun child game. At my first game I manage to make 165 points. At the end of second round all mines were already explored. Nothing to do in the third phase unless sell all salt cubes. The two turns wait to sell goods at the castle are really annoying, seems that the designers want to make the game last more time with afraid that it was to quick. Buy workers, get cubes, sell them at the castle. A fun game to play with your kids once or twice.

First impression (4 players): I liked the theme for a change. It's a worker place game where you try to mine for salt from mines. I like how you must pay to other players for transporting salt from the bottom parts of the mine if you don't have workers to do so. On the other hand these minor payments eventually might be determining the winner in a tight game and at least in our game they were more or less done in semi-random fashion (when there was a choice) until the later parts of the game. I would've liked that there would be more salt tiles because now every game is played with same set of tiles which in the long run feels a bit boring. Tools offer perhaps a bit too much of flexibility especially if you can collect a couple of those that help you with digging. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The mining chain system and the ticket queue form the core, otherwise there isn't anything new here. It's an entertaining package nevertheless.

My main issue with the game is that the setup is too static: All mine, ticket, and tool tiles are used in every game. This is most problematic with the mine tiles but some variety with the tickets would be welcome as well. Luckily, the expansion addresses this issue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Efficient if hardly outstanding worker-placement-ish sort of game. The mining tunnels are great fun, especially into the one-upmanship of the final round, but there is a distinct runaway leader problem, and - once the random draws have been resolved - a strictly hierarchical action-selection system.

Altra opera prima dello Spiel 2010 che diventa una delle sorprese della fiera. Ambientazione insolita (Estrazione di sale nella Polonia tardo medievale) e veste grafica di tutto rispetto nascondono una meccanica interessante che salva Magnum Sal dall'essere il solito clone di Stone Age / Pilastri della Terra.
Il grosso dell'azione e del divertimento avvengono sotto terra. Una miniera da scoprire tessera dopo tessera grazie a una finta cooperazione tra giocatori, obbligati da regolamento ad esplorare le viscere della terra uno accanto all'altro. Dovendo pagare i minatori del "trenino" ogni volta che la catena di trasporto non include un proprio giocatore, l'estrazione rischia di avvantaggiare più gli avversari che sé stessi.
Un piccolo gioiellino nascosto sotto terra.

On paper this sounded like a nice worker placement game, in practice it was boring. Somehow the theme/gameplay didn't grab my attention at all. Quite a lot of downtime between turns didn't help either.

This is a really interesting game where you are trying to make the most money, mostly by filling recipe tiles, with cubes that you dig out of the mineshaft. The rules for the game are very simple, which is nice. The general idea is you can move workers around in the mine and they can collect the cubes for you. The tricky part is, you can only move workers in such a way that there is still a continuous chain of meeples belonging to all players, and when you extract the cubes, you have to pay money to the people who are in the spots that you aren't. It's a really fun logistics puzzle. Additionally there is a board of special actions you can take without a meeple, and someone can assign a meeple to the action, which means when anyone does that action the person with the assigned meeple gets a dollar from the bank afterwards. 

The game provides a lot of player interaction, and opportunities to steal opportunities out from under other players, which adds some nice tension. One issue is that you do see 100% of the tiles every game, with only the order of appearance being randomized. This leads multiple plays to feel somewhat samey.

Quite fresh in the worker placement genre, with semi-fixed placement of workers in the mine. Plays otherwise well, but seems to be rather prone for kingmaking. On average one only earns a few coins per action, yet it is quite easy to end up giving some other player even more than that as a side effect of one's own action.

An interesting Fresco variant that is more tight and unforgiving and slightly more complicated, the board setup looks interesting and is definitely unique but unfortunately plays like any other game. Generic artwork and a plastered on theme makes this more meh than yay.

Excellent worker placement game, made even better by the expansion. Careful planning, seeing what the rest does and timing it all right makes it maybe not very original, but it has enough twists and a great theme to make this one a really fun game.

There's a lot to like about Magnum Sal. It doesn't do anything groundbreaking in it's mechanics but rather mixes mechanics from a lot of great games to create something fresh. I especially enjoy the way the miners line up down the mineshaft and how workers line up to fill the king's orders.

I only have two complaints about the game-
1. It can be hard to gauge a proper strategy. Players tend to be dead last one second and having a sizable lead the next.
2. The components look fantastic but actually aren't very sturdy. The tiles especially feel like they could easily fall apart.

Overall- I really enjoy Magnum Sal. It's simple yet has plenty of tough choices for players to make. It doesn't tread any new ground mechanically but altogether feels like it's own game. Just a ton of fun.

 First game went well, played with the wife and she really enjoyed it. Neat mechanics of sending your workers down into the mine shafts to extract cubes of salt while others are up visiting buildings to buy, sell, fill contracts, hire more workers, extract water from the mining sections and more.

Yippee! A game about working in the salt mines!  I don't normally rate a game after 1 play, but I am sure that I'll never give this another try.  Very dry, very hard work, and not much fun.  Actually, I guess they nailed the salt mine theme.

RATING: 7
This is a very good worker placement game with unique mechanics.  I really like having to pay other miners to transport your salt out of the mine if you do not have a miner in line of the exiting path.  Components are very good as they use tiles where most games would have used regular playing cards (the coins are too small though, the only negative complaint about the components.) Lots of interesting choices to make in this game. Rating is based on a 2 player game - I think the game could easily be rated a bit higher with more players. Fun game, certainly recommended!

Start slowly, but the accumulation of tools, workers, and wealth lets one accelerate towards the end.  But, there is always a cost of doing so - paying others to transport salt, costs to assistants as one tries to maximize the limited number of royal contracts one can achieve.  Requires some planning and tempo awareness, but an engaging game.

[b]Strengths[/b]
This works great with 2p.
The board artwork is nice and the card stock for the other bits is good.
The 'unbroken chain' of workers is an interesting mechanic
For a Euro game, the theme works really well with most (not all) of the mechanics.
If you like worker placement games and are looking for something a bit different this might be a good game for you.

[b]Cons[/b]
Set up is a bit fiddly but not bad.

[b]Other Thoughts[/b]
I think a few plays would leave a person in strong position against new players as they would be able to deduce remaining contracts/mine chambers etc.

RATING: 7.5
In Magnum Sal you place workers, mine for salt and fulfill order for the king. Sounds like pretty standard fare for a euro, but this fine-tuned game has enough going for it to actually find a place in many gamer's collections.

With only 2 actions per turn, there is a lot to think about and plenty of difficult decisions. The worker placement in the mine unfolds differently in each of the 3 phases and much of the decision making will be centered around how to not give the other players easy money or an easy salt cube. When to place a miner on the castle track is also a major consideration. Since everyone is competing for orders, you have to get there before the juicy orders dry up, but if you don't have the resources to fulfill the order two turns later you're slapped with a penalty. The tools also add a lot of variability in how each phase will play out, and also some unpredictability.

Magnum Sal has a beautiful board. the artwork is terrific, and the wooden bits are nice. If I had to complain, the card stock used for the tiles is a bit cheap (think alea, but slightly less durable). You could also legitimately level the complaint of this game being fiddly, but not deal-breaking fiddly. Lastly, what's up with the denominations of money? Yes, it is a dry euro, but I can think of plenty of fantastic but dry cube pushers with little to no theme: El Grande, Egizia, Hansa, etc... Despite these minor flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I'd love to see some future expansions that could easily be added.

Played 1 4P game back in 2011, and recently revisited this title with 3P in 2014. Magnum Sal is a decent worker placement game with a salt-mining subgame as its distinguishing feature. I like the idea of being able to leech off other players' efforts when collecting resources, and taxing them for transporting the salts.

The tweak on the fulfilling of royal orders is also smart. Having to queue in line increases the importance of forward planning, and occasionally requires a bit of a gamble to pull off. The other elements in the game, such as the market, tools workshop and inn are more or less recycled from existing Euros. 

If there are any drawbacks to the game it's that towards the end of the phase it is possible to have no viable moves left. That, and the fact that the game lasts a little long for its weight. However, there's nothing substantially interesting about this game that would make me get a copy for myself.

It's a set collection pick-up-and-deliver game sort of like Freya's Folly, with a worker placement (with a twist!) mechanic added in, and themed about salt (!) instead of gems. The mine has one main shaft with 3 levels branching off of it; deeper levels have more valuable salts. Players place workers in a chain down the mine -- the twist here is that the chain may never be broken, only extended (or pulled back) from the end. Each room along the shafts must first be reached/explored (flip the tile over, revealing the types of salt present) then mined. To get the salt out of the mine, you must pay 1 coin to each helper used in the link to transport the cube. The board shows several other places to place workers: water pump, to remove water from rooms and make mining more efficient; inn, to hire extra miners (more meeples); market, to buy/sell cubes; general store, to buy tools (to make other actions more efficient); king's castle, to sell sets of gems for coins (=VP). Each location also has place for an overseer -- a single player's meeple -- who collects a commission for every transaction conducted there. 

It's not a great game, but rather a pretty solid game in the genre. The only new mechanic here is the requirement to chain workers in the mine. And, perhaps, having to constantly pay other players to use their workers (in the mine shaft to transport salt, or the overseers on the board): not exactly new, but I don't remember playing anything where there was so much money flying around the table throughout the game.

Anyway, the game works well and I'd rather play this than Freya's Folly. But Mary would not, so we won't likely be buying this one!

A perfectly adequate light eurogame themed -- and here, at least, is a novelty -- around mining salt in Poland. Over three rounds, players descend into the mines, mining and hauling out salt; if opponents miners are part of the chain to carry it out, they must be paid. The lack of exclusivity makes this less interesting than it could be and the return of the miners at the end of each round diminishes the positional aspect in favour of three smaller efficiency games.

It's enjoyable enough, but not really deep enough to hold interest. The expansion appears to offer some minor improvements.

Played prototypes in the middle of development. Would like to give the final version a try.
Edit: Played final version. Finally it become quite decent eurogame, although I found that all tools and privileges are a key to success in the game, what limits strategies a bit. I appreciate some kind of pressure the mining part imposes upon players and a bit different approach to typical worker-placement system. Workers chain is nice addidition, although not all players like it.

Solid but slightly dull worker-placement game with a salt mining theme. The object is to extract salt from a mine of three levels to meet specific orders, which in turn reward you with money. The deeper you send your workers into the mine the better the quality of the salt available. There's a semi-cooperative element to the placement of workers as opponents' pieces can be used to help you (at a cost) to transport the salt from the mine, and you have to be mindful of assisting opponents by taking actions to remove water from the mine, something that is necessary to obtain the salt, and then your opponent taking advantage of this by finding it easier to take salt for themselves. The victor is the person to amass the most money after three rounds of the game. This is a solid game and the element where you have to be aware of not assisting your opponents too much is a nice aspect of the gameplay, but overall it plays slightly too long for what it is and lacking in tension, which unfortunately makes it a little dull.

A worker-placement and pick-up-and-deliver game, Magnum Sal falls squarely into the solid but not spectacular category for me. Everything works well and the game is definitely an interesting exercise in efficiency, but there's nothing terribly innovative or compelling here. It's an OK game, but it's a close call whether it stays in my collection. I suspect rating might move down a notch with future plays and very much doubt my rating will increase.

RATING: 6
Dry and heavy worker placement/pick-up and delivery-game, in which the placement of the workers is important twice. Once in regards to what and where you want to pick-up and deliver but also in where you see potential to generate income by positioning your pawns on the way (or as assistants), so that other players just don't get around using your talents (meeples). 
But just because a person has to drop me a coin for using my pawns, doesn't mean interaction to me. There's no negotiation, so what's proclaimed as interactivity is me opening my hand to receive whatever amount of money an opponent has to pay me for using my workforce, which I can't deny. So again, where's the involvement? 
The mechanic of workers getting fatigued is not really new. I can't point my finger on it, but I'm sure there's ganes with this mechanic.
After all, this is a solid game. But it most definitely is not the fountain of youth for this type of game.

First Impression:

A mathematical euro game, with a lot of cutthroat interaction.

The game is a pure euro, and is well balanced. The theme, though weird, is also well intergrated and you really get into the role of a.. salt mining group manager. 

Though most of the game time flows well, the game is occasionally halting to analysis paralysis. The mathematical nature also is not of my taste, and finally a cutthroat euro is not for the fainthearted. The deliveries to the king system works well, but is a bit hard to monitor.

The game works, and the theme keeps it, but I'm not completely sure about it yet. I need to play it more.

So far only one solo (2p) game, but I'm a bit underwhelmed. All of the salt mining mechanics sounded very fresh (to me at least), but the sum of its parts leads to a simple worker placement game. For a theme so well integrated into the game, the game play felt distinctly derivative. Will need to give it a few more plays before I pass judgement.

Edit: After playing a game with a flesh and blood opponent, I'm starting to warm to this game. It's by no means anything new, but it also does what it does reasonably well. Faint Praise, I know, but it's a good game.

Well, it's pretty great.  I'm not 100% convinced that Warmachine needed a MkII, but I'm not complaining about the results.  The rules are very easy to learn, the games play quick, and the miniatures are still great, so it's definitely a great game.

Probably the best Minis game out there, imho.  Engrossing, great style, and very well balanced.  This game is a TON of fun.

I have probably spent the most time playing this game, but there are flaws:
  The plastic quality is just not as good as other dedicated minis games (GW, resin).  
  Because of all the crazy abilities, there is a LOT of memorization in the game.  
  If you don't know exactly what each of your opponent's models does, you can easily lose a game.  There are also some crazy solos (4% of an army) that can swing the game all on their own.  Because everyone has access to some of these guys, it's not unbalanced for the most part, but it is a detriment to enjoying the game.
  A lot of people get into the game for the big robots, but the robots are for the most part a minor part of the game.

WarMachine does so many things right. The combat is fast and tactically deep. The game gives you the right number of choices to make each turn to keep things interesting without getting bogged down. And though minis gaming can be expensive, WarMachine gives the players a chance to totally change their playstyle by swapping out a single figure on the board - commanders are so central to the game that you can change the way your whole force plays just by swapping that one fig.

I'm an occasional player trying to get my friends more interested in regular play. When recording plays of [i]Warmachine[/i] and [i]Hordes[/i], I will record the game for the army list I play. Often times, my opponent could be playing a faction from the other system.

I usually consider myself a player of the following factions:

• Rhulic [i][thing=74766]Mercenaries[/thing][/i] - please give us an eGorten!
• Blindwater Congregation (Gatormen [i][thing=88878]Minions[/thing][/i])
• [i][thing=74774]Trollbloods[/thing][/i] - primarily an eDoomshaper devotee
• [i][thing=69696]Khador[/thing][/i] - a pButcher and Man-o-War player

These days I am focusing on getting many of the all-in-one army boxes released by Privateer built and available for friends to use to try and stoke interested. I posted overviews of the first four 'core' armies from each game on my [b][blog=26]BGG blog[/blog][/b].

As with the first edition: an interesting combination of skirmish miniatures game and combo-based CCG. The resource management of Focus is good, and you still don't need to paint as much as some games. Sadly, most factions don't seem to concentrate on the stompy Warjacks; why play this game, if not for the stompy Warjacks? :)

The new edition mostly streamlined some things, and simplified unit/model point totals. No complaints for my part.

I run Trollbloods in Warmahordes. I have a ton of these guys and I really love the system. Privateer Press does a great job supporting the community and marketing its product in a positive way. The rules are great and not too hard once you have a few games under your belt. The one thing that gets complicated is that every single unit has their own little special rules that you'd better memorize if you want to stay competitive - including memorizing all things the enemy can do!!

Great skirmish game!  I love the interaction between the abilities of the various characters (eg how the warcasters control the warjacks, how you plan how to deploy your troopers to support your strategy for your warcaster and jacks, etc).  

I also like the fact that you don't need to set aside 8 hours for a game, and you can play with 2 people.

My only issue with this game is that although I like playing the game, I'm not terribly interested in assembling and painting minis.    

I am however willing to pay for prepainted armies so that I can just get in there and play.   I'd give Privateer all my money if they offered this.

RATING: N/A
I don't feel able to rate this game yet after only [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/play/details/14016735]one (very basic) game at a Tabletop Wargaming evening[/url] in which some knowledgeable guys nicely introduced me to Miniature Wargaming. (Thanks, guys! :))

However, there are several things I didn't like at all (about this game and the alternative Miniature Wargames they also showed me) - so my rating won't be high:

1. Price! From what I have been told, Warmachine is even one of the cheaper ones (f. e. compared to Warhammer), because you need much fewer units. But apparently, I still have to spend hundreds of € on a single army if I want to play competitively in a tournament! One army could be called about equivalent to a single deck in a deckbuilding game! And if it itches me to try out other mechanics with a different faction, I basically have to spend hundreds of € again! Just to have two different "army-decks" to switch between! Just wow! :(

2. I don't feel the slightest desire to paint and/or even sculpt miniatures. Actually, I would hate the need to do it. I thought there were more systems with prepainted miniatures so that I wouldn't have to, but apparently not really. (Except Star Trek: X-Wing from what I have been told, so I'd still like to try that one out.)

3. I dislike the chaotic nature of playing with a measuring tape on terrain without hexes (or squares). I had thought there were more systems with hex maps (or square maps), but apparently not. What makes it even worse for me is Warmachine's IMHO unnecessarily stupid rule of not being allowed to measure distances before committing to an action. Which is probably supposed to be thematic, but makes for a very bad game rule in my opinion, particularly in combination with unclear edge cases on the brink of a range which seem to occur frequently.

4. From what I have been told, the exact stats of the units can't be looked up for free online. Instead, the publisher wants players to buy lots of expensive books and/or an also expensive smartphone app with the stats. Which makes #1 above even worse. Impertinent, shame on the publisher! :( Stuff like this belongs in the rules of a game and the rules better be free, dammit!

With that being said, it is possible that Warmachine is still one of the better Miniature Wargames. Which certainly have alluring pros as well, otherwise I wouldn't have sought to try them out. But at the end of the day, that doesn't help much for me when I look at this massive list of disadvantages I see.

However, things would probably be much different for me with a miniature wargame with considerably cheaper, pre-painted plastic miniatures on a hex or square map with free stats of all units. Any advice, does such a game exist? Geekmail me! :)

I've been playing this heavily for the past 7 months, and I wanted to hold off on rating it.  I was so taken with tthe game that I figured that eventually the other shoe would drop and I'd find some warts on this sucker, but no, my enjoyment continues to grow with each game played, and each mini painted.

What I love about the game:
1.  The minis.  There are some amazing sculpts. The metal ones are very clean and need little prep work.  The plastics are already cut off the sprue and made of some resin type susbstance.  I was apprehensive at first, but the plastics have grown on me.
2.  The rules.  The rules are tight.  For the entire game system, which includes the core rules to Hordes/Warmachine, and all 11 of the different faction books, there is only a grand total of 4 pages of errata!  I still have yet to run into an in-game situation that is not dealt with be following the timing flowchart in the rules.  The rules are also very intuitive.  I describe this game to other mini gamers as "the game you already know how to play."
3.  The gameplay.  I love the way Warmachine makes me think.  There is a resource management aspect to it, as you only get so much focus, but you want it to do about 10 different things. You also have to carefully think about which order you activate your units in, as each one resolves all of their actions before the next unit activates.  Each turn is like a little puzzle to maximize the effeciency of your forces.  There are many scenarios to play.  These, combined with the ever-present Warcaster kill objective, make the games decisive.  There is no "play for 6 turns then break out the calculators and add up points to determine the winner" goin on here.
4.  The company.  Privateer press gave the rules away (for free) to the public to playtest before releasing the final version of the game.  They maintain official discussioin forums where you can get timely and "official" answers to any questions you may have.  The entire game system was revised at the same time, to help keep it all balanced against one another.  Also, their release schedule is such that everyone is slowly getting new stuff all of the time.  Privateer Press also allows a VASSAL module of the game.  If you download the quickstart rules for free from their website, you can play on VASSAL to check it out for yourself. 

One of the downsides I suppose is the price, like most miniatures games of this style.  That being said, low points games, with just 3-5 models on a side are very engaging.

I transitioned from large tabletop games to WM/Hordes as GW prices kept climbing.  The lower entry cost/model count allowed me to entice some new people to join our game club.

At some point, Warmachine Mk2 might fall behind in Rating, either as a result of later additions or because new games appear or old games get their own new editions. But as of now, there is no tighter system out there. The rules are as clear and intuitive as any rules system available, the factions as balanced as any I've seen outside systems where there is only aesthetic faction difference. It is not perfect, and questions are beginning to pop up over rules interaction where there is a clear discrepancy between intention and rules, but so far, I have not encountered any real big issues.

A needed re-balancing of a great game that was losing control of itself. The simplified game mechanics and the "un-breaking" of overpowered models, abilities, and combos took my Cryx and Mercs back off my dusty shelves until I had to retire from the game due to a lack of time to devote to serious play. But damn, if my nicely painted models didn't bring me in a good payday on their way out the door...

RATING: 9
It took me a while to warm up to the models for this game, but each faction offers a really unique style and culture. The universe is well thought out and the fluff is nice.
The models are a bit expensive, but overall it's cheaper than Warhammer to have a pretty fleshed out army.
What really makes this game shine are the rules! It takes the best hobby parts of Warhammer and mixes it with the idea of something like a small deckbuilding CCG or an MMO like Guild Wars, where you really have well thought out build lists. This game really intrigues me and I dare say I think I love it more than WH40K. A blast!

RATING: 6
The minis are beautiful, the gameplay is simple, elegant, and allows for a lot of options in strategy. That said, it's a game of special rules and abilities, and can get overly complex when introducing the new releases into your game.

It feels a bit like Magic: The Gathering, in that you're looking for combinations and synergies to affect, and enhance your strategy.

The dice can be your best friend or worst enemy, but such are the chances one takes on the battlefield, and there are mechanics to decrease the luck, but sometimes the best planned strategy can fail. A great game I recommend to all the mini gamers out there. Great sculpts, great rules, and a ton of support from Privateer made this one my favorite of all time.

I enjoy the modeling the most, and PP minis are made for painter's and modeler's. As usual with a minis game, it requires a bit of an investment to have a number of options in strategy. With constant new releases it can get expensive fast.

I played the hell out of this game, but with constant new releases, and the sheer amount I played and ran events for this system, I got kind of bored. Mk2 has renewed my interest, and it's an even better game than MK1. A major improvement, and even tighter rules.

MK2 is a much better, more balanced, and FUN game. Warjacks are now much more durable, and there's been a lot of balancing issues solved. Now is the time to get into Warmachine if you've been on the fence about it.

RATING: 5
Miniatures games have long since lost any interest for me, but even when they were my main hobby I was always more interested in large fantasy games with lots of troops in tight unit formation. The steampunk/fantasy theme of Warmachine just doesn't interest me and the fact that it's generally played with small skirmish units and solo figures interests me even less. It does share some things with other miniatures games though, in that if you care at all about winning there will almost certainly be some discussion/argument about fractions of inches, line of sight, cocked dice, etc. and there will probably be a fair amount of luck involved in the outcome. Another thing I dislike about Warmachine is the fact that you could be kicking your opponents ass but then they have one lucky roll to kill your warcaster and win the game. Not my idea of a good win condition.

A very fun and heavily tactical miniatures game.  Like all such games the rules are a little complicated with many exceptions and options to remember and a bunch of rules that make you think "wouldn't this game be just as much fun without that rule" - BUT for that type of game, it is pretty streamlined and rules-light.  Sort of like being the healthiest cigarette I guess.  

A couple of the mechanics are really innovative.  The damage system is something you would expect from a mechwarrior style game, and really captures the flavor of fighting robots well without being too complicated.  The focus system provides a lot of very interesting choices and resource allocation opportunities.  The tactical nature of it (opposed to the broad strategic strokes of similar games like 40K) means a much larger learning curve and a greater rules knowledge quotient.  

Overall I think its a great game and would love to play it more often if I had time.

Obviously Warmachine isn't going to escape comparison to Warhammer, and in that regard Warmachine is better in almost every way. 

The big winner for me is less figures to paint before you can play. I'm still to finish a Warhammer army. Games Workshop also lost me when they released a new rulebook only 2 years after the previous one (that's a rulebook that costs $120 in Australia). Warmachine's fantasy-meets-steampunk theme is refreshing and interesting. The figures are well sculpted. The gameplay is engaging and I love the Focus mechanic (though tokens, which are sold separately, are a necessity to keep track of everything). 

The few downsides are the lack of anything for the non active player to do (no dice rolling to defend), and the lack of plastic miniatures (there are some, but most have at least some parts that are metal).

My first foray into miniature wargaming.  This reminds me a lot of Magic the Gathering:  each model or unit has a stat card with varying powers, and it's knowing how to play those in combos that will get you a win.

RATING: 8.5
Without a doubt, the tightest system of rules I've seen in tabletop wargaming.  Every character feels unique and the game is very rewarding to play when facing a reasonable opponent.

My only dislike for the game comes from the game being prone to bad matchups, and being terrain dependant, which can make the game feel unbalanced - and some players love this. As the system has grown, just about every new model forces an opponent to go buy a counter to it.  There is far to much skew to the meta game and some casters and models are just a shake-hands-and-walk-away if you brought the wrong model. They will sit so far into the corner niche that a balanced list will get chewed up.

Sometimes you'll setup a table, and the terrain provides an unbalanced advantage to a models abilities.  Even the generic scenarios will not recover from a bad table.  This of course can be compensated for by setting up generic table layouts, but for someone wanting to play a thematic or full table of terrain - forget about having a balanced game.

So with friends who can relax, or for those who are hyper competetive Warmachine is boss, but both players have to take ownership of the experience.

Miniatures games aren't for everyone, but I like this one the best. These types of games are more of a hobby that includes a game. Warmachine and Hordes have a great rule-set that will take some time to master, but are fairly tight and offer a lot of depth.

Own Cygnar, Convergence of Cyriss, and Khador. Do be warned this game will suck your funds dry since the models are not cheap. Also, playing it over and over again can get dull no matter how many different units you field or scenarios you play. Otherwise, it is a good game that should be played in moderation.

I have played 7 games of Warmachine MKII - and so far, so great! As a table top miniatures game, the rules are exceptionally tight.

The index is also amazingly useful. But it would all be just a set of rules, (a very well done set of rules), if the models weren't some of the best ever. Flavorful, creative, and very fun to play. Warmachine MKII is a winner!

By now I have played substantially more than 7 games, probably near 70 or so. Game is still great! (though my winning percentage is not). The more you play, the more you grasp the intricacies. It becomes less getting ahold of your capabilities and more of how to strategically implement your tactical means. The producers of Warmachine have begun to introduce these *very* large models, but unlike the way Greasy Wieners would make them a must purchase, Privateer Press' large models don't break the game. Far from it. They actually seem to be there for the modeling fun and visual impact. Gotta say, I like everything about Warmachine. I have lots of games, but this is the only one I've been playing for over a year.

Further updating, WarmaHordes has added even larger models than before. Sadly, they are over powered and under costed. If WarmaHordes players were anything like GW players, these Colossuses would be on every table for the sheer "must include" winningness of these models. Sad really. Fortunately, most of the folks at the store I go to only use them occasionally, and the tactical fun can be maintained. Still playing this absolutely fantastic game!

My favorite table-top miniatures game of all time. I love the steampunk world it is set in, the fantastic look of the miniatures and the clear rules. 
But it still is a classic table-top miniatures game and does take way to long to play and is in my opinion way to expensive. If you want to roll dice, the feeling to control an army but do not have the time and/or the money (or simply don't want to have it) to collect and paint (yes, if you play miniature games like this YOU HAVE TO PAINT THEM  ... DO IT ... NOW!) check out Summoner Wars.

If you like giant, complex, sprawling, collectible fantasy miniature games that require a lot of time and money, but reward you with a lot of strategic and thematic satisfaction, this is probably the best of the bunch.

Collectable tabletop wargame. Skirmish type battles.  Very fun, both to play and to customize. Games tend to be quick 30-45 min, but you can add larger armies to get a longer play time. The big problem, as with most tabletop wargames, is the complicated rule system and steep early learning curve.

Almost all the miniatures for the game are beautifully sculpted. I've enjoyed painting each and the look of a completed army can be breathtaking. (even for someone with terrible painting skills like me)

I really enjoyed the first "version" of Warmachine.  Cool models.  4 interesting factions.  The rules were manageable, and only broken if you actively sought to break the game.  If you chose models and factions purely based on "coolness" the game was a blast.

MKII improved the presentation of the rules, sure, but the new edition also marked a change in Warmachine culture.  It's now so clearly all about the money, money, money.  New models were put out to replace the "outdated" models. The company switched to plastic after swearing that it never would. New factions have been released that don't organically emerge from the setting.  The miniature styles seem tired to me, repetitive, and downright ugly for the new factions.  And let's face it, the factions all basically play the same now.  It's sort of like high level DnD 4e that way.  More importantly the game seems to actively play TO the lists.  It's Magic in miniature form.  If you're into that thing, great.  I'm not, and it isn't what appealed to me in the first few years of the game.

Warmachine has the virtue of being robust, well thought out, not contradictory, and supported by a company which understands what FAQs are meant to be about. Moving from WFB to Warmachine, one is struck by the balance of the game, and the lower price point from smaller armies.

This little gem used to soak up most of my free time. I usually got spun up and devoted my spare time to this in spurts. So every few weeks I would wrap my brain around this and then take a month break.

This is in my opinion one of the best miniatures game on the market. In the "other" mini game, yeah... you know which one, you can place your army and look across the board and usually determine the winner before someone takes their first turn. This is definitely not the case in Warmachine and the variable abilities on mini's, awesome back story, mechanics and the mini's themselves kept me coming back again and again.

Overall I think that Mark II has some definite merit to it compared to the original edition but I don't know that I like the direction the game took as a whole.  Gameplay was streamlined in many ways but the game also shifted to focus on noticeably larger armies.  This is not necessarily a bad thing for the game but financially it makes this game easily as expensive as a GW game, if not more so.  So not bad really but I don't think this one is my cup of tea anymore.

EDIT: One caveat about this game is that it is balanced and intended for tournament play - A better skilled player should always have the advantage over a rookie despite randomness from dice.

Many people have complained about Warma/Hordes first plays saying that their opponent was excessively anal about where a figure was facing, or that a figure moved a millimetre too far - but this is a serious part of the game play = Accuracy.

This is not a 'rough' game like 40K where moving figures up 'about that far' is tolerated, the system is built upon accuracy.
Certainly in casual games mistakes and particularly learning mistakes will happen, but player be warned when facing a seasoned player!

LOVE THIS GAME!

Solid Rules - After years of GW's rough rule guides, this is a refreshing change to have such solid foundations.
Great Figures - Took a little for some to grow on me, but in an over the top fantasy they are sheer coolness.

Even small games are very enjoyable and can be tense.

RATING: 10
The Mk II rules simply made a great game even better. I love the fact that all the factions are competitive and fairly balanced. There is no GW silliness like "hobby" lists and "tournament" lists. No waiting for years to get an updated Army book, and no models that are so useless that no one uses them. The rules are tight and well-written and the new plastic models are beautiful. The starter kits for both Warmachine and Hordes are great bargains. You can download the starter rules for free, the model cards keep you from lugging the rulebook around, and you actually have an official forum run by the company to post rules questions or ask for advice.

 I have never heard a Warmachine player say "I am going to start playing X faction when their book comes out next month because they are going to be over-powering." Or " I am not playing in next month's tournament because my X army got hosed in the new rules." I have never seen a small business owner post on his website "I can't show you pictures of Warmachine model X to sell you because they are the intellectual property of Privateer Press."

A superior game with superior rules manufactured by a company that cares. Who else would have had an open public field test before publishing their rulebook?"

I love to play and metagame WARMACHINE and HORDES, but man I dislike painting those damned dolls. The game allows for a lot of cheesemongering and it's an absolute blast to come up with something incredibly sneaky.

I used to play in tournaments and do somewhat well but I can't be bothered any more.

This game is expensive in the long run, all miniatures games are.
The Commands and Colours: Ancients players complain about stickering two hundred block before they can play. Imagine that, it's almost cute.

Scyrah player.
Not sure if you'd like Warmachine? Think of Warhammer/40k, but more agressive, with a lower starting price, not needing dozens of the same models, and just changing your general drastically changes how your army handles. That's Warmachine/Hordes.

I have to blame The D6 Generation for this one. They made it sound like a lot of fun. After reading the rules I am really looking forward to play this one. **UPDATE: Having played a handful of solo test games, I'm really eager to get som real plays under my belt. The rules are solid and easy. The different factions are all interesting. Each of them interesting in it's own way. Khador focusing on firepower and armour while lacking in speed. Cygnar that has mastered lightning and electricity. Cryx lacking in armour but compensating with speed and a high body county. Protectorate of Menoth utilizing synergy of different units while burning their enemies. Then there's Retribution of Scyrah, the elves trying to free their imprisoned god. Lastly theres mercenaries that can reinforce your army or field an army of their own. *** Update: Having lost my 25 first games of Warmachine I can conclude that this is a FUN game. I suck at it but it's FUN! *** UPDATE: After 78 plays this game is becoming increasingly fun. I still lose most games but it's often close calls. Most of the losses I can account to one or two mistakes made early in the game. I still play Khador and for the moment I'm enjoying the possibilities afforded by Supreme Kommendant Irusk.

By far the best minis game I've ever played.  I've played almost everything in the GW stables, most of the clix games and several other systems as well.  The ability to play against the sister game [gameid=74771] make the game even more appealing in my book.

If you're interested in learning this game and are in Logan, UT on a Thursday night come to Phoenix Games on Center Street.  We play every Thursday and the group is over a dozen strong with players of all skill levels and everyone is willing to teach or help a guy learn the game.  We also have 2 Press Gangers, Privateer Press' "ambassadors" for the game.

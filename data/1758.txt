Играта е стара и времето е оставило отпечатък върху нея. Липсва една фигурка за врата. Книжката с правилата е разчленена на страници, но няма липсващи такива и се четат нормално. Играта е с колекционерска стойност.

I don't remember ever getting the most out of this as a child - I preferred the simple pick-up-and-play of standard Heroquest. I remember the lack of monsters being a disappointment to me - just Skaven? Sadly, I sold it years ago, thinking it would never be of interest to me again. I would love to dive back in and have another go!

The Random Dungeon Creation [i]sounds[/i] like a good idea, but it is time consuming and ultimately unsatisfying. Character creation is neat, but there is little color to them. It may be "Advanced," but it isn't [i]better.[/i]

Having said that, it may be my favorite Dungeon Crawl game out there.

This game is a mixed bag that is significantly improved (read 'made playable') with some pretty major house rules. The components are lovely and the possibilities for quest creation (especially with the entire GW miniatures range available) are vast. It is best used as a campaign vehicle so having a GM willing to invest some time in coherent - and survivable! - quests is really required for enjoyment. As written (and indeed with major house rules) it is dementedly hard for the heroes. But this is what wandering into unknown dungeons is all about I think.. It is a high-stress experience, but of the best kind :-)

RATING: 7
This nostalgic game is one of the first boardgame version role playing games.  With a campaign setting and interesting back story and lots of support from a monthly magazine, this was an excellent game.  Unfortunately, they dropped the magazine, so it isn't as exciting as it could have been.  I suspect this game was replaced by Warhammer Quest.

Best. Game. Ever.  Though I obsessed about it so much so, that I actually had insomnia for 3 days because everytime I would close my eyes, all I could see where the brown tones of the pieces, and miniatures.  I would enlessly be looking at the rules, and pieces when I closed my eyes.  It was no fun, which is ironic, because JP and I got ALOT of entertainment and gameplay out of this one.  Including lots of bonus rules from White Dwarf we could use.  The board was also used for some of our more advanced Warband games, before that burned out.

Great initially and drives the player on by creating a desire to improve. Eventually one does need to buy more and more miniatures to challenge ever more powerful characters, but it is good fun, simple, and the solo feature gives it some good longevity. 

One quickly wants to tell tales of their exploits in the dungeon but quizzical looks from non-players quickly puts a stop to the urge...

My copy is old, battered, and just a pile of pieces in a box. It hasn't been played in years (many years). Not sure if it's complete or not.

Perhaps I will pull it out someday to see how much of it is actually missing.

RATING: 4
I am a big fan of the original HeroQuest.  This game did not hold up.  The game had added complexity and lost a lot of what made the original HeroQuest great.  The biggest failing of this game in my eyes, however, is the random dungeon generation feature. As appealing as this might be to gamers who wish to run through this game by themselves, it can make taking a party through a dungeon a tedious affair, never knowing wether you will find the mission critical room in a few minutes or a few hours.

I loved Heroquest as a kid, and remembering seeing a copy of this in a store once. Just the idea that there was a bigger, better version of my favorite game set my imagination to work, although I never had the chance to play it or even look through the game until it was long out of print. 

Lots of interesting ideas, so worth a look for raiding to make house rules for other games. May have done better as an expansion for Heroquest, which could have developed the DMs role more, expanded the campaign system, and changed things up with a new henchmen option.

RATING: 5
Semi-succesful attempt to create a hybrid of role- and wargame. The extensive rules promise an interesting experience, but where the game fails is the atmosphere. This is dungeon crawling at it's most basic - only a handful of different monsters and basic features appear again and again (this was supposedly to be changed with expansions - but not many appeared) and torture the patience of the players. Why anybody would want to play a campaign with a character who visits the same three different rooms again and again is anybody's guess. The basic "Heroquest" - although truly "basic" - remains more playable because of it's many expansion and it's appeal to young gamers. Has been greatly surpassed in playability and appeal by newer games like "Heroscape" or most collectible miniature games. Therefore dated, but a "grail" to many for some reason.

I somewhat bought this game on a whim because I loved the original HeroQuest, and overall I was not disappointed.  As the name implies, AHQ adds more depth to the classic HQ game and in many ways is a lite RPG.  My favorite aspect of AHQ is the random "explore as you go" dungeon tile placement as this really satisfied my craving for a classic dungeon crawl.  That being said, I do not like the d12 dice combat system of this game as I found it rather clumsy at times to keep referencing tables.  As  a project, I plan to incorporate a hybrid of both HQ and AHQ (check out Toco's "Allied HeroQuest" forums for more on this).

Excellent dungeon crawler. It is slower moving than classic Heroquest, but it offers more depth, room for tactics and atmosphere.

My favorite of the 'true' dungeoncrawlers due to character generation, random dungeon generator, and classic 80's/early 90's GW feel. Unfortunately, only containing Skaven means a lot of cash will need to be dropped to play anything beyond the default adventure.

RATING: 8.5
Some interesting mechanics around advancement and combat would put this ahead of base HQ, but lack of model and quest variety and requirement to collect the miniature range (even before the out-of-print aspect further ratcheted the cost) restrained the game's potential.

Decent dungeon crawler, but limited in scope.  It seemed like the scaling for the game broke down as characters gained experience.  Clearly behind several other dungeon crawling games.  However, I do like the scarcity of magic items in this game, it made every object you found special.  Had it been better supported, with more variety in adventures and monsters, it might have won a more permanent place in my rotation.

Classic game, with solid theme and interesting attempt at a randomised exploring mechanism. Excellent character development.

Game has some major issues: 

- Lack of balance - characters & enemies are either too weak, or too strong to be enjoyable. 

- Random dungeon building takes away feeling of being on a mission; there is no sense of build up or purpose, just 'hope this next roll will see us find the room we need to'.

- Far, far too many lookup tables which slow the game down to a grind. I've fixed this by coding up my own application when auto generates rooms/monsters etc. without which I find the game virtually unplayable.

- Poor starting miniatures & furnishings (but good room tiles). Certainly when compared to rival games the out of the box selection of miniatures is limited - the game was obviously intended to see further extensive components.

Ultimately a poor execution, but one that strangely still holds (some small parts of) my affection.

Admittedly better than "Heroquest" as far as game play and exploration. It lacked a bit in it's components. This one mainly concentrated on Skaven and had quite a few connected scenarios but did not give you the minis to play them. It only came with one model of skaven so you either had to mark the "special" skaven or buy the metal minis. I liked the fact that the original had many different models of creatures.
At least they threw in charts so you could use "Heroquest" creatures and furniture with this, that was a plus. Probably a better game than "Warhammer Quest" even. The battle system was very similar but 12 or 20 sided die usually makes for a better game. Maybe that's just me. Over all a really good dungeon crawl.

Liked the idea alot, but really this game is a newbie intro game for younger players. I, as usual, added a lot of house rules to make it better, but then I'd already moved on to something else. I even made a special enlarged map on a vinyl one I got at the hobby store with permanent markers so I didn't have to use the crappy one that came with the game......way too small and crowded with the cool furniture that was included. Most of my minis are painted too.

I prefer the original HeroQuest. There comes a point where the 'simplification' of old concepts becomes so simplified it's mundane. The original game at least made me feel like I was playing an advanced form of Dungeon. This version makes me feel like I'm playing a very dumbed down RPG where dialogue and free choice have been eleminated. "Put down the dice, step away from the game, and use your imagination instead."

What I liked about this game when we played is the competition of the Game Master to actually KILL the players.  He's both encouraged and the game is balanced to enable him to wait until moments where the characters are weak to spring traps and ambushes on them.  For a person that was sick and tired of mollycoddling PC's through powergaming-heavy D&D or Vampire, this was a great alternative.

As a standalone game, it's a bit poor. You only get 20 equal skaven miniatures as enemies, not even the special ones used in the rulebook quest (champion, sentry, warlord, etc). However, the kinda role-playing style rules gives the chance of a great customization, using another miniatures, creating character and monster sheets, making your own dungeons or left the dice and tables generate randomly the sections, rooms and encounters.

Update: 27 years later, I've found some 2nd hand "cheap" miniatures and I'm thinking to give this another chance.

At the first page of the rulebook it becomes clear that this is pretty much an attempt to get people to buy more GW miniatures. The dungeon generation mechanism is solid, but also pretty generic. The base campaign includes four dungeons, and if they had included different "special rooms" for each and perhaps even modified event tables a bit (say, traps are more common in one dungeon than in the others), this could have been great. Wait a moment... I think Warhammer Quest says hello.

We used extensive house rules to turn this into almost an honest RPG.  Especially fun was when one of the characters decided to become a Chaos Champion of Khorne and became the other characters' nemesis.

This game doesn't work on any level. The random generated dungeons is a great idea i theory. In practice there is just a lot of long empty corridors with a few room, and not really much to do but wander aimlessly hoping to find an encounter of some kind, before you get bored mapping the area. And the encounters themselves are just a lot of dice rolls, with very little strategy involved. May be good with fully pregenerated dungeons, but on the whole I'd rather just play the original HeroQuest.

One of my favorite fantasy adventure roleplay games that I thought was designed quite well. It uses D12 and has exploration, treasure and monster matrix tables that you role on. So the game could be played without a GM/DM. The combat system works good but not everyone that I introduced the game too enjoyed it. The game had a definit appeal to me since it followed in the footsteps of Heroquest another fantasy dungeon game I am very fond of.

Much more balanced than Warhammer Quest, especially as characters rise in levels. Rules such as monster sentries that can run for reinforcements make the dungeon seem more real.  Many of the cool rules were not transferred to WHQ which makes this game so much better.  Random dungeon makes the GM and player experience so much more fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game, but not worth the price tag. 

For starters, while you get enough heroes and men-at-arms for the players, you only get one adventure, and, even so, only one sculpture (Skaven ratmen) for *all* the monsters you fight in the adventure. You're expected to buy not only more miniatures for the adventures you create, you're also encouraged to buy the miniatures of the "boss monsters" in the adventure that comes with the game! The base game doesn't even come with the extensive treasure list, released in a supplement, IIRC, nor spells for the other wizard schools. The game is semi-good with HeroQuest, in that AHQ has some vaguely useful tables that use the HeroQuest components.

AHQ *is* unique (at least when it was released) in that you first make a "weapon skill vs. weapon skill" die roll to hit, then a "strength vs. toughess" roll for damage. I like the AHQ mechanics, but not much else.

If you can get a scan of the AHQ rules, you *have* the game. You're better off getting a Border's 40% off coupon, buying a 4e D&D core book set for $60 after coupon, and making up your own adventures with the HeroQuest figures!

Battle against the Rat Men! You can tell there wasn't a lot of competition when this came out. Slightly more point to it if you already have a substantial collection of monster miniatures. The tables for generating solo dungeons in the old AD&D DM's guide are better than this flimsy product. Comes complete with swinging doors, though! And a bunch of identical rat men! What larks, Pip!
Edit : my original ratings of 2 then 3 seem a bit harsh. The quality of the tiles is pretty good, and as an expansion for Heroquest it is probably pretty useful. Can't help but compare the rule set to things like the solo dungeoneering tables printed in an issue of Warlock magazine, which I'm pretty sure had more meat to them than the effort made for AHQ
Edit again (April 2011): And having had another look at the rules, having picked up a copy from a charity shop, I have to concede that there is something interesting about how the ruleset approach dungeon-crawling as a boardgame - eg the idea that the GM has to follow a set of rules and randomly generate a dungeon during play. Is this what WHQ refined? The tiles are also well-suited to this purpose. May try playing some time.

Dunnow...tries to add detail but random factor is still huge (perhaps even more so than in HQ), tactical decisions still largely irrelevant, and does not get close to grasping the magic of original Heroquest. Some moderate fun offered by solo play.

RATING: 8
Still one of my favourite games after so many years. It does have its flaws, however to me these are fairly minor and don't detract much from gameplay. I've used this to introduce people to Roleplaying, and if you're mostly into dungeon crawls (even linked ones) I find using a system like this to be much more fun than doing it in a traditional rpg.

For anyone who is owner of Heroquest, absolutely can not miss the Advanced version. Although the themes and characters are the same, we are faced with a different game and definitely more detailed than its predecessor. The main characters are developed as in an RPG, rolling the dice, the same thing happens for maps and monsters to deal with. Dice will tell us whether we are in a room or in a hallway, if there is a trap or what kind of enemy is this: if we can dodge an attack or taking it, etc. A game developed and better features than its predecessor. The thumbnail of the enemies can be implemented by other GW and provide a good diversity in the adventures. The materials and the thumbnails are excellent. Highly recommend to the holders of Heroquest and fans of the games on topic.

Not bad at all, but it gets weird if you play it a lot with the same characters. They make no money/get way overpowered. It's very odd.

About 50 plays?

A great dungeon crawl, and it probably has the best solo dungeon crawling system I have seen so far, with just one minor error, that can be fixed easily with house rules.

Una gran expedición de mazmorra, y probablemente tenga el mejor sistema de exploración en solitario que haya visto hasta ahora, con un solo pequeño error, que puede ser arreglado facilmente con reglas caseras.

Good dungeon crawl game.  Lots of great plastic pieces.  If you can still find this game I recommend picking it up for its collector value alone.  If you like moving small groups of adventurers through dark cavernous lairs

this one is starting to show its age.  Outside of collector's value there are now better dungeon crawl games out there.  I recommend looking at Descent.

I like the idea that the dungeon is made up during gameplay, but wonder if this means a lot of downtime during the game.
From my first impression, I would probably house-rule two things: Doors are 2 squares wide (to prevent bottle-neck situations), and monsters can each choose individually if they move&attack, or attack&move.

RATING: 9
Although this gem is not without its flaws, once house rules are implemented from a host of dedicated sources/websites (or come up with your own) I can without a doubt say this is one of the finest Fantasy Miniatures Boardgame RPGs I have ever played.

In single stand alone game sessions AHQ is simply superb. But I recommend dedicating some time into the Campaign where the RPG elements become more crucial and exciting.

This will NEVER leave my collection.

The too-tiny rooms eliminate any tactical decision making, leaving this game a dreadful rollfest.  Actually a step down from Heroquest.

RATING: 5
Too complicated for a hack and slash game, too simple for a full flegded RPG. At least the original HQ makes no pretention of being a RPG. The modular gameboard is great, as long as you don't make it random. Otherwise you could be stranded in the first levels for hours before you get to the part that really matters.

More involved than HeroQuest, but not as fun. The main improvement is the door pieces have hinges. Nice! 
It's a boardgame/roleplaying game hybrid but doesn't excel at either.

RATING: 5
Not so much a board game as a simplified RPG.  It has the typical GW setup of providing basic rules and a few simple scenarios, with the clear intention of trying to get players to buy more miniatures and expansions if they want to go beyond that.  It's a cynical ploy that, combined with the increasing cost of miniatures, was later to put me right off Games Workshop products.

Similar to Heroquest in name alone, but very cool nonetheless.  Slightly more complex than its simpler namesake, but not dauntingly so.
Tries to bridge a gap between roleplaying and boardgames, but shouldn't have bothered.  Is a boardgame, and a good one at that.  With LOADS of miniatures too.  Skaven cool.

Beautiful production values. VERY simple to explain, pick up and play. There aren't too many true team games around, and this one is really intended to be played 2 vs 2. (3 player and 2 player are listed as variants in the rulebook). It is a somewhat puzzley deduction game - it feels like Mr Jack but for four players; or Escape from the Aliens from Outer Space, but streamlined. The Ghostbusters theme works very well indeed. This is a good game for families, and as a quick filler for gamers, but it really comes into its own if you play multiple plays in one sitting and explore the strategies within.

Traded away for Timbuktu. I can't really think of anyone who would want to play this with me. It's so quick and simple. It didn't really excite me and I lost enthusiasm for it over time.

Still, one to keep an eye on. And I do like the variety of images on the room tiles - something which can make a big difference in swaying my opinion.

What if you took Battleship and actually made it fun? To me, that's what you have here in TPS. It's a simple game of the hunters trying to guess where the ghosts are by picking various rooms somewhat at random. But they have to be fast and clever before the whole house is destroyed.

This was ridiculously easy to learn, very fast to play, and a lot of fun. It's beautifully designed and the mechanism for hiding the ghosts is simple and smart.

A great filler if you can find it at a good price.

RATING: 7.5
À fast-paced strategy game with a traditional feel to it, but with a modern theme and artwork.
After 2 plays, the game seems tougher for the ghost team.
The ghost team has to come up with very efficient strategies in order to have a chance to win, while basic logic seems enough as the hunter team.
Need a few more plays to confirm!

Quick deduction and spatial filler. There is a very small element of bluffing. The variant doesn't add much to the game but it does allow for variable end game condition with a tacked on bidding element.

Components are colorful and function okay for the game.

Not a lot of replayability despite variable setup.

Definitely a fun game with re playability and a bit of strategy. It's like a more fun game of minesweeper for 2-4 players. 2 people hide ghosts, two people hunt them. Ghost wreck rooms in the hotel. Hunters have to discern where those ghosts are before too much damage is done. Art style is fantastic board and pieces are well made. It is just a fun game. Draw backs are after several rounds that go by fairly quickly...You kinda stand there looking at each other and say, "well okay that was fun...What else do you want to play?"

I love the theme of this game, you are essentially the ghost busters chasing a ghost through the building, whilst the ghost is trying to do damage your 'weapons' actually trash the room so get it wrong too often and you win the game for the ghosts.

I was actually quite disappointed when at said con we attempted to play and found that the ghost do not actually fit into the holes in the board which means that when the room is place on top it doesn't lay flat like it is supposed to, therefore you cannot hide the ghosts which means you cannot play.

It looks like I may need to break out the sandpaper and whittle down the ghosts a little so they will actually fit where they are supposed to go and then we can actually play.

This is actually better than I was expecting having read the rulebook. It is more thinky and the room setup is more interesting than it first appears as you can set things up as the ghosts. The ghosts plan is scuppered immediately if the hunters find a ghost very early but if they do not then it is fairly easy to ramp up the points. 

I also found it very difficult to keep track of where the ghosts had actually been placed and indeed was quite surprised when my opponent turned over a room and my ghost wasn't under there at all. I may have made illegal moves because that is where I thought my ghost was.:blush:

RATING: 4
Gameplay isn't that bad, but there are just a bit too many cons. The art is FunForgely beautiful, but the cards (to be used for the master game) are just useless. One could just as well write down a blind bid. And what you are bidding for, is total randomness. While the layout of the rooms on the board could make you decide to bid a bit higher or lower, the luck factor during first turns of the hunter(s) will determine whether the target is within reach or not. The longer it takes to find that first ghost, the more difficult their/his task gets, as more options will be available to the ghost players. I must admit that this part of the game, the deduction puzzle in the vein of Minesweeper & Mr.Jack, is challenging and fun. But it doesn't help either that sometimes you can just spot under which tile a ghost is hidden because it's not totally flat.

The biggest flaw of the game to me sure is the randomness and how much it affects the scoring. A hunter could be lucky and find a ghost during his first turn. At that point, he has at least a 1 out of 8 chance (depending on the number of ghosts around the room that has been destroyed) to find a ghost. That ghost won't be bothering him anymore, and all rooms of that colour are immediately cleared. This shrinks down the options hugely. However, if he is that unlucky that it takes him several turns to find that first ghost, the ghosts get more and more options, so it becomes even more difficult to track down (and remember) the possibilities.

As much as I wanted to like this game, it will probably end up for sale or trade. It sure is a game to be taken lighthearted and I don't have a problem with that at all. But the luck of the first (couple of) turn(s) is just affecting the game too much to really speak of a challenging game of hide & seek. The intended Minesweeper game could too easily become a boring game of Battleship.

My wife and I cracked this open with mum and dad for its first visit to the table. The first thing of note is the great quality of the game. Nice colors and sturdy board and pieces. The rules were easy to follow and we were playing inside five minutes.  The idea of this game is to get points if your playing playing ghost... But each time you get points you give the players playing ghost hunters clues to your location....  the game comes to life as the ghost try to lead the hunters away from where they are but the clues add up ...  will the hunters catch them in time or will the ghosts get the points needed to win... a very fun bluff double bluff game of whit and deduction.
My wife found this one and I'm glad she did :)
Just played this two player... still lots of fun and plays very quickly.

Un jeu simple : les règles sont expliquées en quelques minutes et autant de temps x2 pour que les joueurs les assimile :-)
La qualité du matériel est bonne : les fantômes s'emboitent bien dans les chambres sans que cela se voit.
C'est un jeu "stratégique" ou de "déduction" plutôt puisqu'il est question de dissimuler des fantômes qui explosent littéralement des chambres d'un hôtel : cela ferait penser à un démineur à plusieurs.
Que ce soit à 2,3 ou 4 joueurs, le jeu ne perd pas de son charme, il est rapide est efficace.
Un système d'enchère est également implémenté pour pimenter un peu la partie.
C'est un bon petit jeu à caler en introduction ou entre 2 gros jeux.

RATING: 7
This is one of the games you could perceive either as boring, great fun, or a deeply studious affair, depending on who you play it with. We had great fun with it, and our eyes opened up to the possibilities with each new playing. First comes the setup, seeding the board with the tiles. The hunters want to seed the board to make it easier to later on try and deduce from what base the ghost just worked, limiting the possibilities. The ghosts want to seed the board so later on they can steal high scoring tiles and the hunters won't be able to easily narrow down which base they used to steal the tile from. This part seemed kind of random on first play, but quickly came much more interesting on future plays - this could become quite studious if you wanted. And then in the game play, the hunters reveal a tile to try and locate and shut down a base, but the ghosts will score that tile if it isn't a base. On a ghost turn, they'll reveal and score a tile adjacent to their base. The hunters will quickly narrow down the base possibilities, but the pressure mounts with each failure, and the ghosts will try and reduce the amount of narrowing down as long as possible. The game has lots of "it could be this, this, or this", and Fezzini like "would he do this or that". Yep, it's guessing, but the tile score information adds an element of enjoyable bluff that provides smiles both ways after revelations. Anyway, it's easy to teach and a fun 20 minutes that generates repeat play.

Artwork do melhor e produção de topo, com pressuposto agradável e tema muito apelativo, num jogo que acaba por não corresponder às expectativas e no qual alguns detalhes simples borram a pintura, como o tamanho excessivo dos tokens (tanto em largura, como em altura) ou a pouca ligação dos números dos tiles com os valores das cartas e do manual.

Wasn't at all impressed by demo at 2013 GenCon.  And I'd thought heading in that it might be a buy.  Wow.  Just not much at all there.  And in our demo at least, you could tell where the ghosts were a bit because their rooms seemed to be a tiny bit higher than the non-ghost rooms.

Played once with 2P. The Phantom Society is a beautifully illustrated and thematic game, which is sort of a toss-up between Minesweeper, Mr. Jack and Battleship. Players take on one of two teams, either the Ghosts who hide and mislead Hunters into searching the wrong rooms, or the Hunters who deduce clues left by Ghosts.

The biggest problem is that the ghost tokens fit too snugly into the slots, and as a result the rooms they are in are slightly evident because their tiles are raised. Another issue in the 2P game is that it is easy for the ghost player can easily forget where she placed the ghosts, resulting in a few rechecks.

While it is a clever repurposing of classic game concepts, the game doesn't have much holding power. The 4P game might be a little more interesting though.

This is a clever deduction game that would probably be fun to play with older kids, but for me there just wasn't quite enough to the game to make me want to acquire a copy.

This game is a good, fast game of bluffing and deduction. Best as a 2x2 or 4x4 player team game. There is a good amount of strategy in both tile placement and ghost placement, as well as tile selection.

Bidding cards are pretty useless, instead use IgoUgo. First team plays the ghosts and counts points once all 4 ghosts are revealed. After first game, switch roles. The second set of ghosts have to beat the first set of ghosts score.

Super-quick, and delightfully suspenseful.  I don't think you'll ever find a better Ghostbusters: The Board Game than this.  It's a family-friendly, gamer-friendly deduction game, and really novel.  Plus, it comes with some additional [gorgeous] components to allow you to play in ways more satisfying for gamers.

[b]Note:[/b] You know how the die-punch process leaves one side flat and the other side curved?  …and usually the flat site sits on the table?  That's how the board will sit on the table.  …but always have everyone put the ghosts in [b]curved-side-down[/b].  …and whenever someone wants to move or remove a ghost, [b]push the ghost through the board [u]from the top[/u][/b], so it pops out the bottom of the board (you have to lift the board a little to do this).  That way, you're always pushing curve against curve, and it keeps the edges nice.

RATING: 7
Very fun hunting / hide and seek game. I tend to think of this one as a better battleship. With consequences for missing it at the same time not just shooting blindly. Every action the ghost does, gives a clue to where they are.

RATING: 7
A lightly themed abstract game with amazing components.

Pros:
Amazing component quality - lovely wooden knights and thick cardboard tiles. Very low rules overhead and therefore new gamer friendly. Turns are very quick (no downtime). Random tile set up means good replayability. 

Cons:
A bit dry and the theme is very thin. In two player games you can see your opponent's attacks coming from a mile off and this can lead to a stalemate for much of the game (this may be less of an issue in 3-4 player games). The player aids are a bit busy, but fortunately entirely unnecessary.

Abstract:
Abstract area control game from one of my favourite companies Matagot. It is a tactical and stratetical due to no luck and no hidden information. It is a game with dudes-on-a-map. You use your knights to fight or to convert them into settlements. You collect tokens for points by establishing settlements or steal them from other players. An additional track let you score points.

Thoughts:
Quick, decent game, but a bit too attacky for my taste. You have to attack to win. Combat feels somehow slow. The overall game is and feels quite abstract.

Jogo de controle de área bem fechadinho e preciso, porém dependente da expansão. Gostei do transcorrer do jogo, tempo de jogo e estratégias que ele permite.

RATING: 4
Beautiful components, albeit with almost indecipherable reference cards. Mechanically, the game works; but depending on the sort of players with whom you're playing, the game will go either very defensive (which will make gameplay very, very slow) or some players will find themselves cut off early on and can make no progress at all. It's the latter aspect that kills it for me: what fun is a game where you're sitting around, doing nothing of consequence, hoping it will soon end? Of course, with only two players, you won't run the risk of making no progress; but that might also result in a game with very little interaction. Perhaps best with three players, then?

RATING: 4
A game that reminds me of Settlers in its randomly placed hexagonal terrain, in the way that it is critical to lay claim to the most productive terrain in the set-up, and in the way you then try to grow your empire while blocking opponents' expansion.  Settlers has resource trading, a wandering robber and the potential to score points in several ways.  Barony offers only a pretty feeble threat of attack; it's too easy to make hexes impregnable, you can see those knights coming, and conflict is an inefficient use of your actions.   Beyond that, Barony is just a race to build buildings and score points.

The rules are well written and well laid out.  Component quality is up to Matagot's usual excellent standards.  The artwork is all rather gloomy and humdrum.  Those Dark Ages, eh?

I found this game oddly stressful. I think it's because you're only allowed one action per turn; setting up a move takes several turns in a row where you hope you don't get screwed up.

I do not understand how this game has a high rating (I consider anything 7+ to be a high rating.)  I bought this as soon as it came out.  Game play is too simple and boring.  Maybe with an expansion they could fix this but as it stands it will collect dust on my shelves.  Although, I might use the pieces to upgrade Catan's pieces or something.  Very nice components in this game.  Such a shame it is a snooze fest.

RATING: 7
For fans of no-luck / prefect information games, this is an excellent selection.  The mechanics are very clean.  The turns go by quickly and smoothly.  Play is very straight forward and none too complicated.  It is a fine game.  The strongest complaint about it is that it is so unforgiving.  As everything depends on how well you set up versus your opponents - the game can feel like its over before it really gets started.  This happens far more with inexperienced players and as such, an experienced player will very likely crush the novice quite soundly.  And even as the novice realizes this, the game will not yet have hit the end-state.  There is zero catch-up possibility.  While it might not seem like an obvious link, this game is very close to Hey, That's My Fish.  From initial placement through turn moves.  These 2 games play out similar.  If you enjoy one, you'll likely enjoy the other.  The rating this one gets is lower only because it is a game that I personally just cannot get started right - and hence am far more likely to lose than win.  Realizing this on turn 2 or 3 and just not grasping a solution / recovery plan (if one is even possible), makes the game discouraging to play.  And that feeling knocks the game down a point.  If the strategy and placement click for you, this can easily be an 8 or even a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Area control with simple and modular setup, it's a game of placing and upgrades knights, villages, and cities and then gaining resources from the terrain types you have either built or conquered on. Easy game once you've memorized what the restrictions are on movements and construction, and has an interesting scoring track upon which you are upgrading your character's rank. Another win for Marc Andre, who really specializes at this weight (Splendor was his big hit). Box art and components are quite nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Stellar distillation of an area control game that seems too simple to be taken seriously. However, the simplicity lends very well to a rapid based game that really does capture the feeling of a larger scale endeavor.

Barony is, unsurprisingly, about building a feudal barony, and striving to become the most powerful noble.

It is played on a variable hex map, and after set up has no randomness or hidden information whatsoever, so it is one of those game where the best player wins. Almost.

Players alternate in taking single-action turns, choosing among the six available: turns are often very fast and gameplay proceeds at a brisk pace. Rules are simple and streamlined, and there is much to like.

But it is definitely no chess: there is quite a bit of player induced chaos, and perhaps some kingmaking...

I enjoyed more the rules than my first gameplay. Need to play again to assess correctly my feelings for the game...

Il existe une série TV, une histoire féodale fantasy, géopolitique avec un trône en ferraille, des dragons et des morts violentes à chaque épisode. Ça vous dit quelque chose ? Et bien Barony, c'est un peu pareil, mais sans la partie géopolitique et les dragons. Ici, on essaye juste de s'étaler sur le plateau de jeu avec ses châteaux, ses chevaliers, ses villages, mais surtout d'en déloger les autres, par la force, évidemment.

RATING: 5.5
A very streamlined area control where the ruleset is only 2 pages long. 

The wooden components are top notch. Unfortunately, the game play does not appear to have lots of replayability. The initial city placement is largely going to determine the outcome, because the game play is scripted. It is way too easy to defend (2 pieces, 1 piece in a mountain, stronghold). And to try to attack someone is impossible because movement is so slow that it's telegraphed enough for any player to have plenty of time to react.

RATING: 5
Not my style of game. It's very dry and abstract, and much of the strategy lies in where you place your opening castles. Because of the threat of attack, some moves are almost obligatory to avoid losing a knight or a village, so the game can also get kind of boring in a really frustrating way. The expansion doesn't add much of interest, since with it the game is just as dry and abstract.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 2 players:

I love a good abstract, and this is a pretty neat one. The way pieces convert into other pieces gives you some good choice points, but it makes it tough to plan for someone like me. I tend to prefer abstracts where the actual piece movement/placement is pretty simple, like YINSH (and the other GIPF games) - I'm not a visual person so things like Chess (where each piece moves differently) and Barony (where pieces become other pieces) are difficult for me to think turns ahead in. So this may end up being a game I recommend more highly than I personally will play it (though I definitely want to play it more). But that's fine. It's a good game, and well worth playing.

It will join Domaine as one of my go-to games for 4 players with one or more newbies. Much more interesting than say TTR.

Friendly, and not overtly aggressive game of growth and area control with deterministic combat. Really a bit too tame for my tastes, as it takes quite a lot of effort to step on each other's toes for little gain. Nice rule weight, though, as the game is quickly explained, and plays pleasingly rythmically. I'm hovering between 4 and 5: 4 is for gamers, 5 for family gamers.

A no randomness strategy game of area control. The strategy does seem straightforward to gamers who are familiar with more complex games like Chess.

Nice art livens the abstract gameplay a bit.

Moves up a few notches for its ability to attract a wide range of players, even those that don't tend to like area control. Simplicity in the rules and a beautiful board and components help a lot, plus ... a new expansion!

Great game that goes fast and is well balanced. My only complaint is that people can turtle and/or block off a section of the map too easily. The more you play, the more the game gets more defensive and less interactive. I could see this game benefiting from some asymmetric powers -- something like "who ever owns the most mountain regions, gains this benefit for the next round, etc."

A very tight cutt-throat euro game.

RATING: 7
Barony is a game of territory control with deterministic combat and simple rules that make it feel like an abstract strategy game in many respects. In fact, one could claim it isn't about territory control at all because underneath it all is a race for game end, and once you've bagged the necessary points it doesn't matter whether you retain control of the captured territory, except that it typically allows for easier access to new territory that you need to claim more points.

Pleasantly simple and, due to its abstract feel, I suppose, not so much violently aggressive as thoughtfully hegemonic.

Better than I was expecting! I'm an abstract fan, but after reading the rules and playing a few rounds I felt like maybe the game was going to feel a little more auto-piloty than I would have liked. In the end, there's actually a lot of room to explore and try some different things for max. points. The best part is having to defend yourself from oncoming attacks and look out for opportunities to attack your opponents. The stronger you make yourself offensively, the weaker you become defensively.  That's where a lot of the interest comes in here.  Attacking your opponent can really swing the game, but it can cost a lot of materiel to do so. So there are some real interesting balance things going on. I've only played 2-player but that works well.  Interested in trying 4-player soon!

Jen and my game was very tight. I got the benefit of a swath of plains during setup, but Jen was able to keep me on my toes with some vicious attacks. In the end we were only 10 points off from each other.

Nice looking game... with bland gameplay. It seems that nowadays, most games come with great illustrations or components, but nothing behind it. I'm really getting tired of this.

While this one didn't even made it to my list, I had the opportunity to play it. Well, the game works and it's not bad, but it's more like chess and boring as it is. Go here, build that, put a knight there for defense...

Nothing new or innovative here, which isn't a must, but since there's nothing else that shines through, nothing to see here.

Very quick, no-luck, rather abstract area control strategy game. Good components, variable setup. Nothing new or exciting here, but *very* solid. If more people pick this up (i.e. it doesn't vanish due to lack of hype), I could see this become a modern classic.

I'm not really good at it and would rather play something that involves at least some luck or surprise – but I appreciate the simple elegance of this system.

An abstract in euro-clothing. The turns are fast. The board is clean and the rules are streamlined. The game is fully deterministic with no hidden information or luck, thus king-making situations often arises with 3+ players.  The end-game tiebreaker sucks.

This isn't a bad game.  I am rating it lower than it probably should be because it's just not a mechanic I enjoy.  Its very simple to play.  I'm not sure why its rated on the box at 14+.  It should be closer to 10+, if that.  I believe there is moderate replayability based on the fact that the board is tiles and changes.  The game is all about capturing territory for which you get resources which in turn are worth money.  The money is used to gain rank until someone becomes powerful enough whereby the game ends.  This doesn't mean they win because victory also relies on value of resources.  Game pieces are all wood, tiles are nice, and simple rules.

Love this game! A pure strategy beauty! Straight to the point.

It has a nice abstract/thematic balance. 
Turns are fast (1 action among 6). 
Material is beautiful. 
Layout is never the same, giving it a good replayability.

You gotta try it out!

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2016)

When I learned that the designer was Marc André (I dislike Splendor), my desire to play the game went down. Later I saw Barony in sales across many web stores so my desire to play it plummeted. I decided not to buy it, however all my friends insisted the game was solid so they made me play it, and, I was pleasantly surprised. I do like the game. Barony is a fun area control game.

The rules are easy to grasp, you can teach them under 15 minutes. Playtime is around 1 hour with fast players.

The game components are very good as is usual from Matagot.  Great player aids. The modular board guarantees a high replay value.

The theme is ok, but it is barely there.

Barony offers non-obvious decisions (where to place your cities, where to recruit, when and how to build, who to attack and how to defend). You have so much to do with ONE action per turn. It is very tense and I like this part a lot. There is also lots of player interaction in Barony, so it is (perhaps) best with 4 players.

Initial placement is VERY important. 

On the bad side, I have come to dislike games that allow and/or encourage players to attack the perceived leader (and that’s why I rated it a 6.0). Once upon a time, I loved this facet of games, but now I find it (mostly) tiresome. If all players decide to really attack you, there is no way you can defend all your terrain and tiles. The best strategy (as with most area control games) seems to have a low profile, be near the leader and be ready to jump at the end, but never be the leader or you become the target of all players. I know this can be a positive for you :D, but I’m tired of trying to convince my friends that I’m not the leader and/or convince them someone else is.

Bottom line, I enjoy the game and I could play it from time to time. For me, it is MUCH better than Splendor. Perhaps I will buy it but I’m not 100% sure.

RATING: 3
Played once with 4.  Hated the disincentive to score points with villages (because other players can take the points with their knights).   Got stuck a couple of times just killing time because two of the other players had 2 knights just sitting next to me waiting for me to gain points so they could steal them.  Thankfully the game played fast.  Yech.

Overproduced to an almost ridiculous extent. Like everyone else, I jumped on this because of the strength of Splendor, but this has nearly nothing in common.

Abstract strategy game set on a medieval map with territory building and area control. This game was just so bland to me.

A new (well, unknown to me) designer’s Essen ’15 game that is a good old-fashioned spatial Euro? Is it possible? That's what I asked before finding out that 'new designer' (Marc André) is indeed the designer of Splendor as well. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw during my first and only play. It's something along the lines of Domaine or even Through the Desert with a slightly more modern approach - you have three kind of settlements, five different terrain types (with different features) and whenever it's your turn you have 6 different actions to choose from. So while it's maybe slightly less elegant, the decisions are rather Knizian (I should do five things right now but I have only one action) and sometimes even tricky. I really enjoyed it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is an abstract game. This also involves attacks or playing to prevent attacks. While the game is quite simple and looks quite nice on the table, it isn't my type of game. I had little fun playing this, hence the low rating. I'm sure it works just fine; heck, I even won but I couldn't wait for it to be over.

I got to play this with some coworkers my first time & I've also played with family. I like the simple choices you have (although the player board was not very helpful, too much iconography), how fast each turn goes (since you can only take one action) and how the board is different every time you play ( it also scaled really well from 2-4 players. I've now played three games (two with four players & one with two & I've enjoyed it each time.)I also like how strategic is can be and I know there is still much for me to learn. It also is a pretty fast game. Not having tons of experience in the modern game world I'm not quite sure what you could compare it to. If you get a chance to play it, I say got for it, but make sure you like the game before you buy it.

+Simple game play - take 1 action out of 6 available on your turn.
+Different terrain types matter for points and defensive abilities (mountains, lakes).  Use them to your advantage.
+No luck so it's definitely a battle of wits.  You're constantly trying to out position your opponent.
+Has a bit of a race feeling since reaching the last score column triggers the end game.  Due to this, a higher tension level during the last 1/4 of the game.
+Perfect length for amount of decisions.  
+Quick playing in your face type of game.  Fits a similar slot as Nexus Ops, but a tad bit faster.

Nice components aside, this game is very dull with micro turns and essentially no opportunity for clever play. As a zero sum game, telegraphed positioning and bash the leader are the only tools players have to compete with. Simple one action turns in this game feel inconsequential, like playing less interesting 4 player chess. Not recommended with the rules as written.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]After getting in a few plays at the end of last year and I really wasn't sure if Barony would have staying power. Long story short, Barony has become one of my favorite super fillers and a game I'll break out at any opportunity. The game scales well and is just as good with two as four. The game play is simple yet deep, the game moves along at a quick pace and it is absolutely beautiful set up on the table. Barony is an excellent game that I'm surprised doesn't get more love since it was designed by Marc Andre (the designer of Splendor). I just picked up the expansion which adds some different ways to break some of the rules while not introducing any random elements into the game play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Unique wooden components for each type and beautiful tiles.
- The board is composed of a modular set of tiles which really change how each game plays out. 
- Excellent blend of an abstract and area control game that plays great with 2.
- Lightning quick turns, this game flies by with constant engagement from all the players because it moves so fast. 
- If you want to win you need to react to your opponents moves, in a multiplayer game you may need to coordinate your efforts temporarily. 
- Because of the way scoring works there is a race element to the game (once a point threshold is meet the game ends after the round is finished). 

Not only the biggest surprise of the month for me, but of the year. This game has beautiful components and an attractive set of tiles, but it is an abstract through and through. There have been a few abstracts I've enjoyed (Samurai and Indigo) though most have flopped. Somehow Barony manages to break the game down into an excellent set of choices of which you can only choose one each turn. This keeps the game moving at a great clip and I've yet to see any kind of AP in this game.in a sense you are making micro decisions and since you are only doing one small thing each turn it is easy to change what you are doing in response to other players.[/i]

RATING: N/A
The chess-like description is apt. This game does not have the same magic as Splendor unfortunately. I liked it myself, but I could see my wife quickly becoming annoyed by this game. Splendor had enough randomness to keep her engaged and not so much as to put me off.

Mainly though this game is disappointing because it does not feel all that innovative. Its weird though, I guess i could just say that about Splendor, I mean it did nothing particularly new, it just did it so well. Perhaps that will be this designers mark, doing things well but not breaking the mold. 

Still the other thing I really like about Marc Andre's games is the balance between simpleness and depth.  Here is another prime example.

Another great "abstract with a touch of theme" in my collection.  This one is a real tug-of-war.  Every move is important, so you have to be efficient.  You also have to keep an eye on your opponent.  It's interesting because you may earn 'point tiles' on one turn, and before your next turn, some (or all) of them could be gone if you are not careful.  Simple actions, with great depth of game play.  And the variable set up board is also great.  Nice game!

From the designer of Splendor. Big plus is that turns are also quick. Rules are easy to explain, gaming time is in comparison with the game you get and this game has one of the best player aids ever, as while I was explaining the rules, some other players could already predict the different actions based on the icons.

However, while this is certainly not a bad game, it also doesn't light my fire. It's most of the times quite obvious what to do and it feels more like a race then a game where you are building some kind of engine to gather resources.

Picked up at Dice Tower Ding and Dent. No Ding or dents on it. Solid game. Semi abstract, area control game. Very easy to learn and teach. all in all not much there to explore.

Area control game with interesting attack and defend elements. You're limited to one action per turn which makes most of the moves like chess. "if I do this, then he will do that and then I can do something else". But it's interesting to see limited knights provided, and as with all area control games, you spend half the time convincing others you're not winning.

Let's get this out of the way first...  Barony doesn't have enough movable game pieces with varying strengths to ever be seriously considered "chess-like"  (Hive, for example, definitely is).  

Now, while I love Chess (the greatest of all games) and play it reasonably well, I don't mean here to disparage Barony in any way.  On the contrary, Barony is stellar, so if you're scared away by all the chess comparisons DON'T BE.  To be sure, you must and will strategize through positioning, timing, adapting, and resource management, but this is not some "burn your brain with a million possible permutations on every move"-type pastime.  

How do I love Barony?  In so many "yesses"...  tactile pleasure with the well-made components? Yes.  Aesthetic enjoyment of the game board?  Yes.  Scalability from 2 to 4 players?  Yes.  Reasonable game length?  Yes.  Player interaction?  Yes.  Adaptive and alternate strategies?  Yes.  Replayability?  Yes.  Quick setup?  Yes. Analysis paralysis?  No!

It's an area control game with a small set of easily-memorized rules that make for important decisions, although not necessarily fatal, on every turn.  March those two knights together Sherman-style, for example, toward an opponent's village, but you'll be sacrificing other opportunities for that tactic.    

The game hasn't left the table since we bought it about ten days ago...  quite a statement from people as flighty in entertainment tastes as are my wife and myself.

Very good game. Quick, easy to learn, well balanced and good replayability. Simple rules yet deep. You have always a different board through terrain setup which you have to take into account plus, most important of all, the actions of your opponents. Scoring system is also very straight forward and good. Liked it lot and looking forward to play it again.

Wow, I really enjoyed this. I forgot how good it was. It felt fast, strategic and very much a if you lose it's your fault. 
Although I think with two players go second when it comes to placement is very powerful, and almost game winning! I think we made need to change the rules slightly to make it fairer.

tl;dr: good game, not for me

This is a good game. It has good options, it's well developed, has a very appropriate length. Yes, it's a good game. But the game has an element that I don't like at all: to win you sometimes need to take away things from other players. I don't enjoy that. Not if it's something where the other players need to spend precious time and resources (knights) to build them in the first place. I didn't hate the game for this, but I recognize I'm not the target audience. So if you don't mind this aspect, be sure to give it a try, it's one of those nice quick games that isn't too light either.

Initial rating: 6.5/10

Hard to tell exactly how I feel about this one. It doesn't feel interesting enough, like it doesn't know what kind of game it wants to be. It's fun at times, but most games there is a runaway victor and you're unable to catch them.

First impression after one play was that the early and mid game is not very exciting, but the end game makes up for it. I reckon more play will yield a greater understanding of how to "read" the game in its earlier stages.

RATING: 10
There's just something about this type of perfect information, pseudo-abstract game (Through the Desert, Antike, All Creatures Big and Small, Terra Mystica) that really appeals to me.

This one is very simple on the rules side but offers plenty of fun and tough decisions, all in about 45 minutes. The whole "take one action per turn" mechanic really makes the game. You can plan a big strategy, but your opponents can see it coming so it becomes a matter of choosing when to block an opponent versus when to work for your own strategy.

Speed. The "one action per turn" also serves to keep the game moving right along. There is a ton to think about but somehow turns just fly by and while lost in thought about your next move you'll find yourself asking "oh, it's my turn again?"

Awesome game overall. I could even see my rating going up on this one after more plays.

Update: I have to move this up to a 10. I really can't find any flaw with this game. The whole game is filled with tension, but those last few turns where everybody is a couple of turns away from ending the game are really something.

I love the way the random map layout influences the game. Sometimes water or mountains are mostly around the perimeter of the board, so you have a wide open game where everything is contested. Other times you have mountains and water all through the main board so players can close off sections to themselves.

It's just incredibly fun to play, fast, elegant, and works perfectly for any experience level. 

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
The game is still fine with 2, but more players make it much more interesting. There's a lot more tension because even if one opponent isn't threatening your territory, someone else surely is. So your pieces get spread thin and you have to police each other to make sure someone doesn't dominate too large of an area.
Another consideration, and this can be bad or good based on your preference, but with more players there will of course be more turns between each of your own turns. With two players you could just bounce back and forth, but with more players you have to look at the board and consider how each opponent could affect you before your next turn.

RATING: 8.5
Still working through all player counts, but my first impressions are that this game is GOOD.  Variability only at the point of setup.  The rest of the game is perfect information.  Deep, thinky strategy of area control played out using only 6 different actions.  I like it.  A lot.

RATING: N/A
Not bad, but subject to border fencing and turtling and the possibility of getting your knights locked up if you're not careful. The game seems to devolve into a fairly repetitious series of actions/phases that makes one game similar to the next. I've played with all player counts and IMO it's definitely better with more players.

RATING: 6
I'm not quite seeing the appeal - the extremely slow pace of knight generation and movement seems to give attacking a fairly low return on investment unless it happens to be on the way to where you need to go anyway. The lack of attacking makes it pretty dull. However, I'd be willing to play again to see if we just were missing interesting opportunities.

I suppose that such a lean, abstract design should come as no surprise from the designer of Splendor, but all the same I was impressed by the celerity of play that Barony engendered, even among the more AP prone.

I look forward to getting this to the table more often now that the Sorcery expansion has opened up the game to 5p.

I really like this game. Behind easy rules (1 action per turn among 7 simple actions), you get a really smart blocking and area controlling game. As it's only 1 action per turn, you get a nervous game without waiting time.

As the game is short (30/40 minutes), he will be easily chosen. I'm waiting for it to bring it at our lunch time plays.

[EDIT] after 4 plays, 3 with my 6 y.o. son: it's fun also in 2 with younger players, even if they can't play it strategically. 
I love the fact that a different map radically changes each game.
Raised from 8.0 to 8.2

Very good game of conquest, quite abstract, simple clean and very elegant rules. A game like this really fits well with my tastes. It also plays quite well and fast and AP was lmited (but i guess it could be a serious problem). 
It is somewhat original in the way you score and in the way you can block several game zones without blocking the flow of the game. I'll play it eagerly again and rating could go higher
Components are truly great and once you play it the gameboard looks really nice

When played with two players, Barony certainly reminds me of chess, as other people have mentioned, because you have to think one step ahead. A little bit less so with three and four because it gets a little less predictable. It's a pretty basic game in terms of what you can do on your turn. It was designed by Marc André, who also designed Splendor, and that's pretty clear, because Barony is also a race in which you try to reach the end in as little turns as possible. Overall a decent game, but nothing spectacular.

Initial demo at CK - 4p.  2 of us seemed to enjoy it, one was indifferent, and the wife hated it.  Even after the 3rd round she said this game is awful, and the opinion continued until the end.  Odd because a simple euro area control game should have been up her alley but her complaint was the simplicity.

C'est la vie.

This is a streamlined abstract that nearly has a classic feel. The struggle of doing what benefits you while simultaneously hindering your opponent is perfectly balanced. I honestly surprised myself with how much I liked this game. It was one of those games that I later looked back on playing and thought: "Man, that was a brilliant game! I want to play it again!" The production value is also great, as expected with Matagot.

Played at Essen (2015). This game was high up on my list of "need to play" games because it is a pure strategy game with landgrab elements and has been compare to my favorite Terra Mystica. There's a similarity in the landgrab/expansion and yet there is none because the mechanics are reminiscent only superficially. Barony is far quicker and easier to play with a very streamlined mechanism. I loved the game. We didn't buy it but only because I want to savor it by itself later when we have worked through the huge stack we brought back from the fair.

Plays with up to 4 players with a variable map. The game usually starts by building up the map (this was skipped at the fair), I assume a fair amount of strategy goes into creating the land to play. Then every player gets to place three of his possible five cities. After that the actual game proceeds. There are 7 actions one can take. Because of the many limits placed on these actions it usual comes down to a handful of strategic decisions. Our game went quickly and 45 minutes for a deep strategy game with four players is not as unbelievable as it sounds at first.
 
It has the potential to become one of my favorite games (if only because it should be easier to find people to play it with than Terra Mystica)

Lighter area control on a modular board with determinant combat and cool, colourful wooden pieces. Sets up and cleans up quickly while being easy to explain as well.  That checks off a lot of my marks and the balance of long term planning versus tactical play hits a nice sweet spot too.  I have had some games where an overly non-combative player will leave too much room for someone else to score points in a way that feels almost kingmakerish... but when everyone groks the interaction of the game this is one excellent "heavy filler"

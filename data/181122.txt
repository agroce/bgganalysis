A very unique, very fun take on worker placement and pseudo-area control. Very much like Terror in Meeple City, where you go destroying stuff, but set in the ancient countryside and as a euro game. Sometimes a bit clunky, the player aid doesn't aid as well as I want it to.

I'll admit that as the designer I'm a bit biased.
However, even after the endless play-testing the game still is a joy to play and always remains intriguing and exciting to the very end!

No where in the rules does it say you have to name your dragon, or "fly" it in to the regions you are about to destroy while roaring angrily at civilization... But it is certainly very fun and satisfying to do so!  And strongly encouraged by the designer!

What a great concept. If only the designers had given each dragon. A slight variant strength/weakness to develop, instead of making them all (excreting only the promo) identical. :-/

Very fun family game, easy to learn and play. Tons of good wooden components, nice easy to understand atmospheric board layout, quality cards, and contrary to others' comments I found the rulebook well written and easy to absorb. Well thought out box insert stores everything easily. Even plastic bags are supplied to keep the wooden components separate, which speeds up setup no end. The "yellow" dragon is strangely actually orange, and it would have been nice if each dragon had some character traits/bonuses to make each of them unique. However, who couldn't like burning fields, destroying villages and eating sheep? Give this a try - its available at half price in some sales right now (Xmas 2017). Got mine from Games Lore UK. 9/10 for me, good family fun - would like to see a possible expansion at some point too.

I need to see how this one plays out after a few more games - if the luck of the card tableau dominates, or the optimal strategy is to virtually never spend resources, I'll be disappointed and pass it on. Otherwise, it seems like an interestingly constrained resource-gathering game with a wonderfully evocative rampage-y theme.

(Also: it has co-op rules for devastating the humans together. Have to see how that plays.)

This was interesting. I'm not a fan of the rogue dragon mechanic for two and three player games in practice, though I understand why it's necessary. Have only yet played two players. Very much looking forward to playing with four.

I really enjoyed this one but I don't think it will play it will 6 players again as the last player has no placement options and the players earlier in turn order have no movement options.

It's has a fairly standard worker placement phase but this game really shines on the second phase where your dragon attacks. Certain cards let you gather certain resources from certain areas so there is a level of hand management which I quite like.

It is a bit of a shame that all the dragons are identical, indeed  when levelling we found most players also picked the same options so even levelled dragons were identical to one another, and it'd a bit strange that the yellow dragon has orange pieces, but that said I really loved this one, but then I am dragon nut.

I am a firebreathing God of destruction!:D

RATING: 8
Light-med euro game. Rule book is pretty garbage, but once you make it through that the game is actually really fun. The components are... very generic, and the designer decided to color neutral resources the same as some of the player colors which I wasn't excited about in the least.

Basically: mechanically this game does some really fun and neat stuff, it's not going to knock your socks off and become anyone's game of the year I think, but once you drudge through the rule book and figure I out the component cluster &$@# there is actually a solid game to be had.

There are not many boardgames where you can be a dragon, so the theme was somewhat novel and appealing to me. The mechanics, however, are pretty standard, mostly involving some sort of drafting or gaining and spending resources. The scoring is almost completely based on majorities (of resources and destroyed settlements) and could have been a bit more varied.

The game works well enough, although I'm not a fan of the player order only changing when a player selects that specific action. There is also some unavoidable luck-of-the-draw, but the main flaw is that it does not feel as fun or engaging as the theme suggests, even for a Euro. This is not helped by the decent but pretty standard production. Except for the dragon pieces, everything is very generic and seems to come from other games. The artwork is fine, but the graphic design could be improved, and the board should be larger.

The rulebook is not too bad, but it fails to explain a few things well - all of which were clarified by the designer in a different manner than I expected.

Fantastic game.  A nice reversal on gathering resources to build things.  Instead your plundering and pillaging resources to hoard and win!  Very well done!

Played this again and enjoyed it more. This can be a very unforgiving worker placement game, especially since you only have one worker, and spots for it to be placed are very few. Turn order can be huge, and while you definitely want to gather up resources and buildings, you can't ignore how important it is to be first to act. I really like this game both for being a pretty unique WP game and because you get to be a dragon that terrorizes the countryside. It seems like a bit of a missed opportunity that the different dragon types don't have special abilities, but the game is a fairly basic design anyway. I'm not sure why this game hasn't been picking up traction, because it really is very good. I'm pretty critical of WP games, and this is one of the better ones to come out in the past couple of years.

I need more plays to see how I feel about it, but so far I like it. I'm not really in the to the theme, but it works alright (and it gives the game a chance to differentiate itself). The gameplay seems pretty good though. Plenty of room for strategic and tactical decisions. (I want to try the "strategist" variant where everyone's holdings are known, as I think that looks slightly better, but I suspect different players will feel differently.) Right now I would probably rate it a 7.5 or maybe even a little higher.

One of the best game I've played at Essen.

For a Euro, the theme come out alive pretty nicely. The artwork and the materials are real nice too.

It's strongest features is his unique hand management, dragon control elements.

This game is GODLIKE !!!

Very much enjoyed my play of this game. Solid euro with some interesting drafting and set collection aspects. Traded to acquire it and am looking forward to my full game experience since I only managed to play a few rounds before having to stop. Awesome meeples too! Seems easy to learn and teach so I am excited for this one.

Many things about this game look very random but turn out to only be a little random, and the various mechanics mesh together very well.  I'm not sure how much replay value there is and how much variation there will be between plays, but it was a fun, thematic, and strategic game for at least a few plays.

Working placement/resource gathering game.  I've played this with 2 and 4 players and it really plays better with 4 to 5.  More players means more cards means more fun.  

Easy to pick up the rules.  2 player rules aren't bad.  The more you can have though the better this game is.

Wrath of dragons is a medium light game where you're playing as dragons who wake once a century and rampage. The object of the game is to be the dragon with the bragging rights of having done the most plundering and pillaging.

The game is card driven, with a board with six countries (which you will refer to by color even though they have names). Each round, in turn order everyone chooses one special action spot. This could be the right to be first player the next round, to be the first person to do their plunder/pillage phase next round, extra goods, etc.

Then starting with the start player everyone drafts a card from a common display, with the start player getting the leftover extra card. Cards are tied to a country and action.

In the plunder/pillage phase starting with whoever chose the attack action in the previous round, you place your dragon in the country of your choice. Then in that same order, players play as many action cards as they want, and then remove their dragon from the board.

If you have a card you can play it in the matching country to do its power. That might be to take things that exist in that country (sheep, wheat, gold, nobles) or to attack cities, towns and villages. You can play as many cards as you want on your turn. There's also a central action disc that has those same actions. This can spun so that a particular action points to a particular country. All players have a card (that returns to them each round) that triggers whatever action is pointing towards the country they are in.

There's points awarded for whoever has the most and second most of each good type at the end of the game. But goods also do stuff, so you'll want to spend them. Gold allows you to rotate the central action disc. Nobles heal you 2 points when you eat them. Wheat lets you draw two cards and discard one. Sheep let you move from one country to another (but you can't stop in a country if it is occupied by another player).

Attacking villages, towns and cities does damage to you (which you heal 1 a round). The first village you get from each country is worth a point at game end, with a 4 point bonus if you get one from each country. Cities are just worth a point flat out.

During the game you can level up if you do one of the following on a single turn: destroy 3 villages, destroy a city, get 4 goods. Your first level up lets you either increase your total HP from 4 to 6 or increase your regeneration rate from 1 to 2 a round. Your second level up lets you either travel between countries without eating sheep or turn the central action disc without spending gold. Your last level up gives you a second card to trigger the central action disc.

The game was interesting and more fun than it appeared at the outset, but it's too easy to get randomly screwed. For example, I used a couple of mechanisms in the game to get extra cards. I drew a lot of cards for the black country... but another player went there before I could and took everything that country had, leaving me with a hand full of largely worthless cards. There's too much chance that another player will inadvertently screw you without even meaning to. In our play I managed to recover... we had to call the game before it finished, so I'm not sure who would have won, looking at it before we were kicked out of the game store it looked like it could have been anyone's game. But despite coming back from bad luck, I just didn't really enjoy it that much. It wasn't really bad or anything, just not my thing.

For a game that seems to promise rampaging dragons leveling towns and swallowing brave knights, it sure has a lot of boring Euro mechanics. Now I am normally into boring Euro mechanics, but this game found a way to be too dry even for me. Too much of it feels unnecessary and tacked on. The worker placement phase feels like a catch up mechanic, unrelated to the rest of the game. There is a card draft, but it's only one card, which carries hardly enough benefit to be worth including as a mechanic.

It's weird, because the game seems to want you to fire off big combo turns, but the game is so stingy with card acquisition that it is almost impossible to string one together. Also, placing first is painted as a huge advantage, but in practice it rarely matters, as dragons are removed from the board as players resolve their turns. What you end up with is that the first couple of players will more than likely be able to place their dragon exactly where they want. Those that go later in turn order will not necessarily be where they need to go, but they will not be prevented from moving since those earlier in turn order will have already removed their dragons. It may be slightly less efficient, but certainly not difficult.

All of this means there is very little tension. The majority of points come from claiming sets of buildings, but you will never know where you stand in the player rankings for each color because your progress is essentially hidden (although technically fully trackable). As such, you have very little to go on when it comes time to play your turn. Generally speaking, you end up simply doing what your cards tell you to do, in the most efficient  order as possible. In other words, the game more or less plays you.

Let all of civilization tremble at your mighty wrath as you destroy cities & villages and steal their wealth!  This game lets you become the most notorious/feared/greedy dragon and the scourge of humanity.  I find the game to be loads of fun with 2-3 players, but the game really shines brightest with 5 players in my opinion.  The offers enough elements of player choice and interaction to ensure that the game never plays the same twice.

My current favorite.  Recommended for people who like dragons or enjoy destroying stuff.

Quite easy to learn, yet leaves room for utilizing skill. Needs to be played at intervals, but it is always welcome as a proposition. Plus, as a fan of Euros I adore the components -- even though the dragons could use a little more stability...

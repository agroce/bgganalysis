A fun take on trick taking. I think if I play this a lot I'll have to find a catchup mechanism because toward the end it was a race to get coins from one of the players to be the one to end it.

RATING: 8
A delightful trick taking game that really gets into the parts of trick taking games I enjoy: taking risks and seeing if they pay off. It's fun to get close to pulling off sinning, and remember that one thing you could've done differently... The game gets under your skin.

RATING: 7
Better than Dragonmaster. Might be favorite trick-taking game. But maybe should be a round shorter - it just barely wears out its welcome. (12 hands are too many). You are at the mercy of your cards, which is expected as a trick game, but when this is added to the mercy of the edicts, the capriciousness may be too much. I'd be OK with the sheer randomness if it was slightly shorter - which is why I think 2 rounds may be better than 3.

Reskin of Dragon Master. Beautiful components. At its core, just a trick taking card game. Excellent if you like that sort of thing, which I do.

A reimplementation of Dragon Master.   The age of the design shows, and Restoration has done a nice job to bring it up to date... but the age still shows.  Many of the edicts are redundant and the game is still probably 2x too long for what it is.   Since there is generally no trump and no trading, you are really stuck with the cards you have.   The chance to invert one of the chosen edicts is the key to the whole game.   Can be shortened with maybe half the coins in player's banks and maybe 1/3 fewer times around (house rules).   It's nice to have this game back, but the art and flavor in the new version don't hold up to the really cool Dragon Master suits...  too bad they couldn't get those.   I feel like Was Sticht! does much of these same things better, and that's AFTER the deduction round.

For such a simple game, the components are excessively overproduced. I will never understand why playing cards are ever designed with a single orientation, forcing players to properly align each one before assessing their hand. Production issues aside, the trick taking here is certainly different. The various Edicts offer various scoring methods and players must determine when sinning is most opportunistic. This also introduces an interesting aspect in which the player 'shooting the moon' is immediately identified at the beginning of each round, creating a one-v-many atmosphere each time a Sinner flips an Edict. Additionally, the Papal Bull cards are ingenious and give the game a healthy shot in the arm. They can create huge scoring swings and always refresh the Edict stack which has a tendency to go stale after a few rounds. Most often though, the trick taking is quite ordinary and straight-forward, making for a decent trick taking game, but not one I am excited to share.

so, sin is a game mechanic?  what?

I am really looking forward to having this game in my collection. It puts a new twist on trick taking card games.  It's light, fun and easy to learn.  The rounds can go quickly and you can go from last to the lead in one hand.  The edict and sinner aspect of it makes it much more interesting.  The art is great and I love the colors! And did I mention the ring??? Sinner's get a ring to seal the deal on taking a trick.  I had a lot of playing this game and am impatiently waiting for it's release now!

Although Indulgence is a good game, with great production quality, I think some of the other contemporary trick-taking games out there are better.  I like the idea of this game a lot, but the reality is that players simply take turns getting paid (whoever chooses the edict) as "sinning" rarely can be pulled off.

RATING: 6
Not my favorite trick taker, but I see the appeal. My frustration was with rounds ending quickly if someone makes the wrong move - better than playing it out and wasting time, for sure, but it just felt frustrating whenever I didn't get to play a good hand of cards. Production is top-notch!

Quickly has become both my favorite trick-taking game, as well as at our events. Folks don't really care about the theme - and I don't blame them - but for me, the vibe that the theme adds really brings it home to me, and why it got our InnRoads Approved seal. That might just be the history buff in me though.

Combined with a strong emphasis on tactics at the expense of strategy, The evaluation skills required to play trick taking games escape me, and I'm not interested in pursuing them. I'd rather play [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16632/gops]GOPS[/url] or any of it's reimplementations

Feels like it is a trick-tacking games made for people who don't like trick taking games. Each turn one player is the ruler who chooses the "edict" that the other players must follow, or else pay the ruler for breaking the rule. A player can also choose to be a "sinner" before the hand starts, in which if they intentionally break the rules and receive a handsome payout for it. On the other hand, if they get set, they suffer a hefty loss. The game plays over stays its welcome at 45 minutes or so. The edict cards are a bit random. Some are very hard to complete, others are very easy. The game overall is too swingy and random for my tastes. I would grit my teeth and play it again, but inside I would be screaming "Nooooooooo!"

Trick taking game where each turn, someone is the ruler who chooses the "edict" that other players must follow, or else pay the ruler for breaking the rule. A player can also choose to be a "sinner" before the hand starts, in which case they are taking a risk of breaking the edict completely for a larger payout/loss. There's better trick taking games out there. I would never play this over Sticheln.

This is dwarf king  version  1.5
I hate trick takers that are decided before the cards are even played ... leader choses an edict that i will pick up most of the points for ... there is nothing i can do. This game needs a passing mechanic to add strategy to ur hand before the rule is drawn or after .. right now its deal and get lucky or not.

Example of stupidity of this game ... im leader and holding 2 red card ( 4 and 1) i take the edict dont take any red cards. First person to my left selects to sin and shows his hand of 5 red cards ...   auto win for him ...

Every hand is different and the production values (Particularly at this MSRP) are crazy good but here's the thing... many of the edicts really carve out huge chunks of the game that don't matter making many plays feel irrelevant.  I want to like this game more than I do.

I love the varying rules. I love the ring. I love the look. The length is just too long for this. Perhaps my thoughts change in the future, but for now there are other games I'd prefer to play with the trick taking genre such as Tichu, The Bottle Imp, and maybe even Custom Heroes.

It's tough.  The trick-taker is equal parts very hard and very easy, based on card distribution and the papal ring.  The cards are unnecessarily big, the game bits are overproduced... and yet I can't push it away because when it works it works.

Trick taking game where the rules are changing each round. Only gets interesting when people are sinning. I had the best round when I was sinning and felt every card mattered and the way I was playing could break at any moment. That was the round with the most tension for me and was interesting. The other rounds were forgettable. A game I would like to revisit, but I am not sure it will ever be a go to game for me or anyone in my group.

Oct 2017: From 7 to 6.5. This game is *really* light. I wish there were more cards in the deck. Only 9 cards in each suit means less opportunities to play with void suits!

Poor card design! There should be an index in *each corner of the card* ... not just one! Also, the colors are sometimes hard to distinguish, and the suit that corresponds to each color are also hard to see!

Sept 2017: Better than expected. It's a straightforward trick-taker: There are no special weird cards in the "main" deck of 36 cards.

Unlike traditional trick takers where the objectives are all about winning the most tricks or the most card points in tricks, in this one, the objectives are much simpler. That means the hands go by really, really fast.

I would have preferred better card stock. Also, the art isn't that great, considering how awesome the artwork is for [gameid=2].

Note that this is *not* a themed version of the classic [url=https://www.pagat.com/compendium/barbu.html]Barbu[/url] like Dragonmaster. Players do not have a list of contracts that they must play, one different contract per hand. In this one, you pick from among three that's face up on the table. This makes the duration of the game game much, much shorter, but then players can avoid the more difficult contracts more easily.

Simple risk taking game.  You play one card per round high card takes the trick. What makes this game interesting is:
1) not all tricks are worth anything.  Before each round you choose what you are trying to accomplish.
2) you can decide to take a risk and accomplish the exact opposite of the given objective.  When you take this risk, you get a ring which allows you to turn any card into a 10 (the cards are 1-9).  So you have a special power when you take the risk, but the other players will be working together to try to make you fail.

Good game!

Aug. 2017: Played at Gen Con with Adam D, his wife Krista, & Allen.  I'm not much of a fan of trick-taking games and this one added in some quirky stuff that made it more confusing to me.  I ended up 2nd place (almost won) which seems even stranger since I was clueless.  I think it's a good/great game for people who like trick-taking games, but it's definitely not for me.

As printed, it's boring.  A single edict in play at a time is just not enough to drive interesting play, and too many tricks just don't matter.  1/3 of the time, someone puts out 3 edicts and things get interesting.

solution:  always pick 2 edicts (unless you do the special thing to take 3).  On a normal turn, the sinner just sins against one edict.  There can still only be one sinner at a time.

as is:  5/10
with fix:  7/10

I had a really hard time figuring out how to make sinning or beating sinners work, since this game doesn't have a trump, you're not really rewarded for getting rid of all the cards in your suit and it's a lot more difficult to hang on to control or regain control after you've lost it, but I started to get the hang of it near the end of the game. The Edicts really make the game interesting, without them it'd be a boring trick taker, but with them it's quite interesting, and my rating may go up higher with repeat plays. Also the production value on the game is ridiculous.

Variety trick-taking card game with selectable contracts - like Barbu, only those are mandatory contracts. Ability to "sin," or completely counter the chosen contract (kind of like shooting the moon) makes for fun and tension. Plain, no-trump trick-taking makes it more accessible of the category.

Interesting trick taking game. I do feel like some of the edicts are too easy to do with the right hand. Also, the game seems to lack as much depth as I want. Without a trump suit it feels a bit too straight forward.

Finally, and my biggest complaint, is that all the cards are used each round so you can card count everything. I really wish there was a few cards removed to add some unpredictability to the game. Would play it again, but without some variant I'd rather be playing something like Tichu.

A good trick-taking game. Incredibly simple system: no trump, you have to follow suit, and you don't want to take any tricks. The twist is that each round has different rules for which cards you don't want to take, and you can "sin" by declaring that you WILL take all of the restricted cards. The restrictions are all simple: don't take any blue cards, don't take any 2's or 3's, etc.

The only possible issues are that there is no way to mitigate bad hands, and it seems common for a player to fall behind in points and have no way of winning near the end. If you get a hand full of high numbers you won't do so well.

Overall I like it for a light, casual trick-taker.

A trick taking game where you almost always are avoiding taking tricks.  We played two hands.  One where there was only one edict in play and literally only three hands of 9 mattered at all.  Another where three edicts were in play which was much more interesting... but one player had been dealt a lot of one suit of cards so couldn't shoot the moon and got dumped on hard ending the game with him being out of money instead.  So... if you love trick taking games you might just love this because it is a trick taking game... but I know there are better games in this genre available.

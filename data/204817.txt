Kickstarted this one - its probably my favourite game from Kickstarter actually. Love the art and the components and its pretty straightforward to teach.

I like the different routes to victory, and have tried each. Sometimes things go to plan, sometimes the wrong cards completely scupper you. That's actually part of the fun for me.

A great game. I love the 'take that' elements of the game, and the different paths you can take to victory. Beautiful game board, illustrations make me smile, well produced, and a compact box. Now all we need is a 7th site!

Backed it on kickstarter and never got my game (but eventually got my money back). The publisher, Jocus, took ages to answer to any messages and was lying in his updates. I really regret backing this game which looks actually quite promising.

Though I'm not fond of the artwork and does not play much games based on tricks players play on each other, I like my one game session a lot.

Game material is really great and, once you got the cards in hands, the artwork looks nice.
The game is simple to learn, plays smoothly and makes it for a lot of fun.

Sad that this won't get a true BGG rating due to all the p**sed off Kickstarters who have not received.  While I get their anger, it's not reflective on the game.  Solid, fun 4-player game.

Very silly and a lot of "take that" (especially in a 2-player game) but the theme is great and it plays very smoothly so I like it a lot. Excited to try with more, especially since I have the deluxe that plays 5.

I am one of the fortunate few to get my money back, but as of this writing (Dec 2017), Jocus is 9 months late in delivery and blames it on everyone but themselves: backers, manufacturers, distributors, fulfillment, etc. The few times they deign to update their backers, they ask for more money. It would have been a relief if they'd just admitted they spent the money and didn't intend to fulfill. Strongly recommend you don't ever back any Kickstarter they might offer. You will almost certainly get burned.

Kickstarter Deluxe Edition. Received it this week.
Played it for the first time with my 11 years old son. Theme and art are great and funny. Rules book needs improvement - explaining cards usage (some of them are not clear). More symbolic explanation on cards would be prefered to make the game less language dependant. Need to play more...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Gorgeous artwork. That alone caught my eye.
It's also a fast game with a little of area majority and very simple engine building. Most of all it's very "take thatish", since it involves dueling other players and some other mean cards.
To me it's fun, it's fast and it's recommended.

I just backed on Kickstarter. Seems a funny game with an original design and a solid mechanism. Can't wait to have it in my hands!

RATING: 10
Simply excellent !

Multiple ways to win the game, none guaranteed since it will depends from the other players strategies.

The game is easy to explain to new players since there is 4 rounds ("days" in the game) and the first one isn't decisive ; you can play and the new players will learn without losing their chances for the final.

What I love about this game is that can choose which kind of cards you will have in your hand. There is enough randomness so you cannot predict everything and you are forced to improvise ; but you have enough control so you can decide your strategy.

A good light game for the family of casual players.
It deserves an higher rating than the present average one.
I think its rating has been ruined by the logistic disaster in the kickstarter campaign.

Every player gets a number of henchmen as his workers. Then in a first phase you take turns in placing those guys on the different sites and draw a card from there. The different sites have their own attributes (weapons, “take that“ cards, point cards etc.) If you have the majority on a site, you get to draw an additional card from there.
Then in taking turns you play cards and resolve its effects and bonuses.
The winner is the player to either have at least 30 points at the end of a day or the player with the most points after the fourth day.
I really enjoyed playing this game, the cards are all very interesting with many effects to resolve. The art is phantastic. Clear recommendation

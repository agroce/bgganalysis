RATING: 7.5
For hardcore gamers who won't sit down to a game with an average game length under 4 hours, this probably is not for you. But this definitely has a place for a group looking for a game that is very interactive, fun, fairly short (under an hour with four players), and loaded with theme and adventure that due to the random tiles is never the same game, you'll have a great time with this one. The expansions add even more goodness.

RATING: 10
Played the prototype and had a lot of fun.  Was simple enough to pick up how to play right away yet complex enough to require some strategy and thought.  It strikes a nice balance between being simple enough as a gateway game and yet involved enough to keep gamers interested.  Definitely on my list of games to get.

RATING: 8.3
While not the best exploration game I've ever played (that honour belongs to Expedition: Northwest Passage), Relic Expedition is, by far, the best-themed exploration game I've ever played! Just dripping with theme, even with the layout of the rulebook; and the beautifully carved meeples only add to the magic. Much, much better than the somewhat disappointing Lost Valley.

Luck? Oh yeah: gobs of luck! You definitely want to play this for the experience...the grand experience of ADVENTURE! The ending will be sudden and unexpected. 

I was expecting this game to be bitterly cutthroat, and was pleasantly surprised to find it not as bad as I anticipated. Compared with Survive, for example, Relic Expedition is a walk through the poison ivy infested and quicksand mired park. Yes, snakes, panthers, wild boars and pickpocketing monkeys abound; but actually being hit with one isn't overly common. Nevertheless, pick up tranquilizer darts if and when you can! 

The more players you have, the better. A wonderful game for all ages, except, perhaps, for younger children: being trampled by a wild boar is never pleasant.

I was fortunate enough to play Relic Expedition during its "beta days" (when we all just called it "the jungle game). Even when the rules were in constant flux, and we would play variations one after the other, I knew that it had the potential to be a solid hit.

Right off the bat, there is the entire mystery of a gameboard that is unrevealed to the players: this ensures a different playing experience each and every time. Hell, I remember desperately trying to get to one simple relic on the other side of the river only to keep pulling animal space after animal space on my way to that relic.

The semi-random, semi-"tools of your enemy" nature of the animals is an entirely different experience altogether. If you've ever played the Dragon & Princess expansion for Carcassonne, you'll understand the basic mechanics of the animals. Me being the cruel monster that I am, have had no qualms in sending snake after boar after panther after someone who was close to reaching their goals when I've been still looking for that blasted canoe or flashlight.

It's easy to learn, addictive to play and, ultimately, very well thought out. The thought of potentials for expansion really excite me a lot. Definitely worth checking out.

// Fun, simple set collection/exploration style game. Not a
favorite, but it's easy to set up and play when the mood is
right. My only frustration is that the rulebook doesn't
clarify everything and could be laid out a bit better.

RATING: 6
I love the theme and the tile laying aspect of the game. I feel that there are too many tiles explored with every move, which makes the game too quick and easy.  It's probably a little simpler than what I was hoping for.

I do like the way that inventory is handled in this game, I wish there was a little more going on with it though.

Roll a die to determine how many action points you get. Then spend the action points on your turn. (So possible analysis paralysis. And not much to do when it's not your turn, so potential downtime issues.) Random terrain revealed when you get close to it. Send animals to attack opponents. Collect tokens. Fun animeeples. No reviews yet.

A wonderful game but Arcadia Quest just always wins when I’m in the mood for a silly fun game. 

Includes the Missions expansion from the BGG Store. 

Everything is in great condition, but the wooden item holder for the yellow player has a bend in it. Likely a manufacturer defect (or just a warp in the wood) but I’ve never tried to replace it.

My first big Kickstarter disappointment. You make virtually no interesting choices throughout the whole game: simply move around, draw tiles, and hope you get lucky. If you do get lucky, great! Pick up a relic. If you don't, too bad! You get torn apart by a jaguar and lose all of your stuff. 

I'd say this would be a perfect game for kids, but frankly, I think even kids would get bored with it pretty quickly.

RATING: 8.55
Finally an adventure-archeology themed game that works both thematically (high on reality, low on fantasy) and mechanically. Replacement/alternative to Artefakt which is only in German, never had a big marketing push and is much simpler (and also has worse meeples.)

KickStarted, and glad to do so. Comparisons can be made with The Cave (another favourite title of mine), but in many ways, this surpasses it in every way. Random amount of actions, player vs. player action, hunting for set relics rather than just amassing points for points' sake... all aspects which I had hoped might make it into The Cave through an expansion. 

Slight tweaks could be made to the equipment system (I personally houserule for the random free draw so that it can only be chosen on tiles in which it makes sense, such as the base camp or any helicopter clearing).

A jungle exploration game with a variable board, hand management, collectible treasures, and dangerous wild animals! The game board starts small, with only a few of the tiles revealed. As players explore the jungle, new tiles are revealed and the board grows in unpredictable ways, making for a completely different game each time. Hidden in the jungle, you'll find six different types of treasures made of six different materials. To win, you must collect four matching treasures — either four of the same type or four of the same material — and fly away from the jungle to victory.

Pure randomness. If the die rolls and tile draws go against you then you can spend the whole game doing nothing. My opponents took pity on me and didn't send animals at me every time they could have or I wouldn't have even have had the chance to roll the dice and draw the tiles to see how crappy they were.

If you try this game with your hardcore gamer buddies, you will be mocked. However, if you bring it out with your family or friends of your kids, it will satisfy! This is a family game, no doubt. What it does well is capture the spirit of exploration and adventure. Players can hinder each other by sending wild animals at their opponents. How your backpack inventory is managed and how monkeys steal is creatively executed. It reminds me a bit of an old-style computer adventure game where you need stuff in your inventory to do stuff and if you don't have it you need to find it. Rated for how well it succeeds at what it tries to do, even if I don't ever see myself playing this with an adult-only audience. It's like a kids' movie with enough stuff in there for adults to enjoy as well.

This game is fun - however the rules are not perfect.

What this translates to is a game that has a lot of potential IF the rules can be ironed out more.

There are numerous rules for specific, one-case scenarios that make the game unnecessarily complicated and unintuitive.

There is also little to no player interaction, and much of the game is based on move-by-move chance rather than strategy.

The tile-laying mechanism is OUTSTANDINGLY entertaining, but in combination with the chance element, can make the game a bit frustrating as there seems little to plan.

Overall though, excellent components and base rule-structure means it has a lot going for it, and with some rule streamlining it could easily be rated a 9 or 10

02-28-2014 - Initially I rated this a 7, but it's been some time since I've played, and thinking back to it and how (un-)excited I am to play it again, I bumped it down to a 5.  It's not *bad*, but not really my cup of tea.  It was just too random and easy to get behind due to no fault of your own.  Then again, an experienced player won, thus indicating that it's not just completely random, but all the same I'm not real interested anymore.  It's cute though and has some nice components.  I'd play again, but wouldn't go out of my way.

If Settlers of Catan and Carcassone had a baby, and it grew up to be the new cool kid, it would be Relic Expedition.

Simple game that might work very well as a gateway game. Otherwise, it's too light for me.

Very good family game - the turns are quick and the game moves along at a good pace.  The map building is fun as well.  The components are good, but the colors on some of the pieces is a little too difficult to distinguish which makes cleaning it up a bit tricky.  A good light game that my kids enjoyed and that I will recommend to family gamers!

Really enjoy this game! Had the opportunity to play a prototype while it was in the early design stages and it was great. Relic Expedition has the right mix of strategic game play and variability that keeps me coming back to games like this, Carcassonne and Catan (esp. the Fog Island scenario in Seafarers). I can easily see my kids (ages 9 and 10) getting into this game too... not too difficult to learn, and they would totally dig the jungle adventure theme. Anxious to be getting my hands on a copy as soon as it gets funded on Kickstarter!

RATING: 8
Lesser known find.  Cool little, family-oriented exploration / set collection game with nice jungle theme.  Jungle animal meeples are pretty cool. Search jungle for relics, use equipment to survive and assist, collect a set of similar relics, and catch a helicopter to victory.  Probably would not do much for adult gamers alone but my kids really like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game was a total dud. You walk around this expanding jungle landscape, collecting items semi-randomly and collecting tokens looking for a set of 4, while other players throw beautiful animal meeples at you, then unless you have the right item, you are slowed down or killed, undoing your progress entirely. It felt awkward and frustrating, especially because most of the items you use to mitigate damage are one time use and the animals get to hit you every time their die result is rolled.

I was disappointed with this game.

1. Seems too fiddly. You are constantly placing tiles, placing chits, placing animals. Just seemed like half the game was hand work.

2. Animals not exciting. Okay so there are 4 different animals but all they do is make you lose a turn and / or drop the items in your back pack. 

3. Not much angst. Seems half baked.

4. Rule book not the greatest. Comes in 2 parts, one short 2 page sheet is set up and some game explanations and examples, and then you get another small booklet with more rules and explanations.  Just seemed confusing.

Rating based on 2 players. Probably a good family game with kids. It just didn't click with us even though we do like many family style games.

RATING: 7.25
A fun, simple exploration game a la Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider, where you move around the jungle looking for relics to make a matching set of 4, which you fly out with in a helicopter.  There are wild animals to be avoided or countered with traps and tranquilisers, and you will need to select and carry other supplies in your backpack to assist your adventure.  In addition to quicksand and poison ivy perils, there's also mountain, river and cave terrain to be negotiated in your search for the treasures.  

For me, a couple of rule modifications are highly desirable - particularly not rolling a die for random action/movement allowance of between 2 and 4.   But otherwise the game is very easy to learn and play, with effective game mechanisms and great components (including wooden adventurers and animals), making an excellent packages for family or casual gaming.

I wanted to like this one, but it didn't work for me. It was difficult to distinguish important tile features in the dark muddy artwork. Placing tiles during movement seemed to interrupt play in such a way it was always difficult to keep track of how much movement you had remaining. Overall there was just too much random for me. I house-ruled some of it away, but it wasn't enough for me to keep it. 

I could see this being a great family game though, for those that really enjoy the theme.

My first every Kickstarter board game.  Seeing some of the board games on Kickstarter (I used to browse the video games) helped me discover BGG and get me into the hobby.

Really wanted to like this one.  I love the tiles and the meeples and the end goal, but not some of the mechanics that bring them together. 

Dislike the idea of roll to move.  Solved using the variant that everyone has 3 moves, however the animals (which play a larger roll) have too much "take that".  Losing a turn is a pain in the butt.

Thought about ways to tweak the game and in the end decided it was better to focus on other games, that are already in a state I enjoy, than fiddle playtesting this one. 

Was tough, I wanted to like it and bring it to the table, and it had some sentimental value, however I have limited game shelf space and other games were more interesting to me every time.  

A good game if you know what it is and are happy with it's design.  Just not for me.

I've had chance to play Relic Expedition in beta form a few times and I really can't wait to play it again. It was easy to pick up even for players who don't play a lot of board games.

There are three things in particular that stand out:

1) The board is built out randomly as you explore, limited only by the table you're playing on. From one game to the next you can never anticipate anything. Only that you need to explore more, or try to take advantage of what other players have found through their explorations.

2) The backpack limits you to eight items. Early in a game this seems like a lot of space, but as you collect treasures that space shrinks. And you won't be able to carry enough to save you from all the dangers you could face.

3) When the animal dice is thrown, the other players can get a chance at moving the matching animals on the board. And they will sabotage you if you're not protected.

I've recently picked up a number of games I think are really fun, like Takenoko, Ticket to Ride, Fortune and Glory and Arkham Asylum and while all of those are fun, Relic Expedition is a game I'd recommend above any of them.

RATING: N/A
kickstarted

A fairly simple tile-laying game with enough variety & choices that it doesn't look like it'll overstay it's welcome quickly. Collect the right set of Relic tokens randomly appearing on jungle tiles, get back to base & win, while dodging hazards from tiles (easy to avoid) and wildlife (controlled by other players, and less easy...) Plenty of choices, and not too long a playing time.

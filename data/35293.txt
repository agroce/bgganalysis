Feels almost Carcassonne-y. Wustensohne is better than Jadegottin, but not by much. I wish the third in the series (Daemonsomething) would have been made. :(

Oh, and make sure to play with the official rules tweak, that doesnt allow cities to face the edge of the board. Otherwise, someone can run along the edge of the "board" completing small cities. Not fun that way.

Cool Entdecker variant. A little exploration, a little area majority, a little market manipulation. Fun. Not sure why this didn't do well enough to see the 3rd in the series get published.

I really like both the new Entdecker games - they hit the sweet spot for me, simple play, nice theme, tough choices, tight resources. Great games which I expect to be playing for some time.

RATING: 7
Neat twist on the Entdecker design.  I really liked the mechanism with the heights of the figures determining the order in which rewards are chosen, with the tallest figure having to pay water for the privilege of going first.  A pretty interesting system where it's often better to be 2nd place rather than 1st.  I also enjoyed the use of the water tokens as payment for special abilities.  Since water availability is pretty limited, you definitely have to spend it wisely!  Overall, a neater lighter twist if you like Entdecker but would like something a little different.

The end result was under-whelming for me, I prefer Entdecker for example. The height comparison was novel, but fiddly and hard to judge. The icons were tiny, the overall lay-out was un-inspiring (yes, I did lose the first game), and there was a bit too much screwage. But I will give it another go, and I'd use different tactics I think. More collecting one item, more price manipulation. But I can't see this hitting the table often.

Im Reich der Wüstensöhne is clearly part of Klaus Teuber's Entdecker line of games. The basic premise is still the same: draw a tile, place it if possible, deploy meeples, and score finished areas.

This game adds a few things that the old Entdecker didn't have, however. Scoring oases doesn't immediately grant victory points. Instead players can use action spaces to collect goods which in turn score points at the end of the game. The value of those goods, however, is variable to a small but significant extent and changes through player actions.

The game is less luck-dependent than its predecessor and adds another layer to think about, offering a little more to gamers while still clearly remaining a family title.

Plays well - I think truer to the original Entdecker than the New Entdecker version.  Reminds me of Goldland. Not a must buy, but happy to play.  The clarification ruling about the restrictions building to the outside improves things a lot - more fighting over each oasis!

Not better than the Jade Goddess, but different. The first is simpler and cooperation is usually awarded. In this new version, a player is usually better off working on his own. Both er very good, though.

Reasonably fun family game. Not particularly deep and quite random, but the game still isn't completely trivial and presents you with some interesting choices. Possibly just a tad too long and repetitive for its depth. Not a game I need to own, but fun to play once in a while.

It took more than 6 years from purchase to finally hitting the table. Games by Teuber are a hard sell these days to the discerning crowd I'm gaming with. They are too far on the family side of gaming and too traditional in their euro mechanisms to rouse interest in my group. 

In case of 'Im Reich der Wüstensöhne' this is a pity as it is a decent family game with some appeal for experienced gamers as well. Its already the fourth incarnation of the system Teuber started with [gameid=200]. I sold the original Entdecker as it felt underdeveloped and in need of house rules. The Wüstensöhne is more polished. It's a nice combination of the known tile-laying with a simple but smooth economic system of water tokens that are essential to keep the caravan moving.

This system fuels player interaction. Leeching water from other players when joining their oasis for scoring is the interesting part for gamers. Adding to the appeal is a rudimentary stock market aspect with rumours influencing the value of goods. The randomness in exploration is thematically appropriate. Cleverly using the water-based economy for improved actions goes a long way in mitigating randomness. A unique feature I've never seen somewhere else are the 16 player pieces that all have differing heights.

Official rules change by Teuber: To avoid exploiting borders to easily close off oases, only desert is allowed on the borders. The result is that the last few turns might be useless as tiles are getting useless earlier. Except for this unplanned effect, Im Reich der Wüstensöhne has perfectioned the Entdecker system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not really a fan of the Entdecker system, though this was moderately interesting.  I'd like to try it again with more receptive players, as some probably had an inherent bias against the game due to previous experience and a dislike for tile laying.  There are some interesting ideas here, and the game length seems about right.  But I guess Carcassonne ruined me on the whole "draw a tile, place a tile" mechanic, which doesn't seem very fun to me.  Still, I have hopes for this game that it will become more enjoyable with a couple more plays.

Update: Traded away - too hard to get it to the table.

Just 1 play. Nice update to Entdecker.  Adds some decisions around which goods to collect and how much carrying capacity to build.  Probably a better game than Entdecker, but also a longer game.  I own Entdecker, and do not own this one, and while it was good - I will probably stick with original Entdecker.

Ah well. Explore some tiles, place some meeples, complete a section of the board, score some points. Not a bad game, a bit more complex than it appears at first, a bit of rules ambiguity. Very playable but also a bit forgettable. Nice gateway, though.

RATING: 7
It's an enjoyable tile laying/exploration game. Has a bit of luck and winds down to an end-game where you're just really hoping for the right tower to fit your potential scoring situation. There's also an interesting scoring system that often opens up through cooperation. Items for sets, etc. are then collected through an area control mechanism involving the heights of the pieces you invested in the area.

RATING: 7
The game has similar basic mechanic as (Die Neuen) Entdecker. I haven't played Entdecker but I like this game more than Die Neuen Entdecker. The gameplay is quite simple but has just enough depth to be interesting. Probably best with 4 players as then there is more interaction and nastiness between players. 

Update : Played with Teuber's variant where you can't end oasis areas to the "sides" of play area. This reduces a luck of draw a bit but makes endgame less interesting as on the last 1/4 of space it is really hard to create oases anymore.

It's a desert version of Entdecker. Move your explorer, place a tile leading off where you are, and then place meeples in any oasis you start or add to. When it's closed off, each person in the oasis takes turns taking stuff that the tiles indicate were in the oasis, mainly water, resources, extra storage for resources or rumours. Water's good because it allows extra turns, extra movement and covers payment costs of having the first take in an oasis. Resources give you the VPs needed to win the game, and rumours will increase or decrease the given resource values by a secret amount. The game is hugely tactical, choosing when to conserve or spend water, when to go off by yourself creating your own oasis or when to try and get onto other people's, exactly the same process as Entdecker. This tactical nature wasn't enough to sustain my interest over 60 minutes, and there was enough luck in the tile draws to reduce emotional engagement in the result. For a tile laying game, turns could sometimes be surprisingly slow while people evaluated the best place to be before drawing a tile (ie first choosing what oasis you wanted to be on in terms of competition vs resources on offer and chances of people coming in later, vs the odds of drawing the type of tile needed to be able to get in). So, a slow tile layer with little strategic overlay, not my favourite.

RATING: 6.4
Interesting, feels a bit like Carcassonne but with a simple economic engine. The tension is about co-operation vs working alone, and generally it provides that pretty well. Knowing the tile distribution seems critical, although the Scout ability is a neat way to increase your chance of closing an oasis as well as increasing interaction.

Im Reich der Wüstensöhne -- Played once; three-player.

I've always particularly enjoyed the previous iterations of Entdecker.  My only complaint has been that games lasted too long. (A game of such middling depth does not warrant such a long duration.)  Reviews indicated that [i]Im Reich der Wüstensöhne[/i] took the Entedecker engine, made some significant tweaks, and shortened the game duration.  As we played, I found myself comparing the game to Entdecker and enjoying both its similarities and differences.  The basic exploration element was comfortably familiar, while the thematic changes were refreshing.  I found the restricted movement through oases and the scarcity of water particularly thematic.  The special actions (extra turn, unrestricted travel, and placement of a landscape tile from another player's display) gave players additional control while contributing to water's scarcity.

As the end of our first game approached, the players' relative scores became apparent, but there appeared to be no way to change the ranks.  The player in the lead had more goods tokens than the rest of us, and he had been the only one to play rumor tiles.  In the early game, we had not taken advantage of the rumor bonuses (I had planned to do so after players had collected enough goods that I could determine which goods to influence), and now there were not enough rumor bonuses left on the remaining oases to affect the relative values of the our goods.

Note to self:  Next time, collect rumor bonuses  and influence the goods market early!  Only you know whether the face-down rumor token you've placed is positive or negative.  Once all six tokens are placed, they can be moved, further obscuring goods values.  Particularly if several players place enough of them, it will be unlikely that anyone will be able to keep track of which player modified which goods, thereby retaining a sense of jeopardy throughout the endgame. 

Also, I do wonder if playing with four players (rather than three) would improve the game.  With more players, more bonuses may be claimed -- increasing the likelihood that rumors will take effect.  More players may also help divide the interests in goods, so the rumors could have more varied effects.

I think the unsatisfying end to our first game may have been a fluke based on my own poor choices.  And since the gameplay itself was so strong (and so fun) for most of the game, I think my rating may rise after another play.

1 play - finally, after having it for over 1 year!

This is certainly heavier (more gamer-y) than the Jade Goddess version: no randomly acquired pieces for set-collection, some special rules (spend water to do stuff) that increase interaction, the ability to used saved tiles from previous turns (or steal another player's tile). Still, it seemed just OK -- not as good as the original Entecker (Neuen version). But you really need water, and it sorta sucks when you can't seem to draw any of the right tiles! Also, it seemed better for us (3er) to just do our own thing, exploring in our own corners. Maybe there would have been more mobility, and more interaction, if I'd managed to get some water! 

I probably need to go back and play that again, to see if still holds up. Right now, though, I think I like the original the best.

--- Summary ---
Set up a cross; players will be playing tiles in the empty spaces, max 11x11 grid (each quadrant is 5x5). The tiles are sorted into 5 groups (numbered on back), each stack shuffled. Players each get 2 water tokens, a tile, a caravan (2 camels=space for 4 goods), and a different set of pieces (each set is unique, with different-height pieces that all sum to the same height). Randomly determined start player's tallest explorer gets the turban (place it on top of token). Each player's caravan starts on one end of one of the crossbars in the starting cross. 

On your turn...
1. MOVE your camel: as far as you want along brown paths; movement ends immediately after crossing a white segment (unless you spend 1 water: then, treat all white paths as if they were blue). 
2. Then, may DISCOVER: pick a direction from your current position from which to explore; if there's an empty space there, may try to place a tile: either use one of your saved tiles, spend a water to use someone else's saved tile, or draw from the top of the lowest-numbered stack. If drawing and cannot play the tile, save it (may save max 3 tiles; if have 3 already, may not draw a tile when discovering). If you place a tile, move your camel onto it. If there is part of an oasis on the just-placed tile, may place one of your explorers into it. If that tile completes any oasis, score it. If you didn't place an explorer, may instead take back a previously placed explorer.

May spend a water to take a second turn right away (but not a 3rd). 

Scoring: sort all explorers in oasis by height, except turban-wearer always is first. If 2+ explorers, person in front must spend a water tile or is returned to player. Then, in order front->back, players place explorer onto an available action space in the oasis, if any. If turban-wearer was involved, pass turban to next player clockwise (who immediately places it on their tallest explorer). 

Action spaces:
- collect water, incense, myrrh, salt, or ___; or add a camel to your caravan.
Game ends when last tile is drawn. All players, including that player, get one more turn. Then, reveal the rumor tokens and determine value of each of the goods; player with most valuable goods in caravan wins game.

RATING: 8
[Kosmos 08 edition] {Arabian exploration; tile-placement, set-collection; optimal 4p}   Im Reich der Wüstensöhne is thematic and fun.  In terms of control, it's better than the Im Reich der Jadegöttin.  In terms of fun, they are similar.  The design of different explorer heights is clever.  It breaks tie easily and provide tactical choices for players.  And, players have to balance the collection of wares, camels, water and rumors.  One can't without either one - choices are limited without water; tallest explorer can't take booty without water;  can't take many goods without camels; can't win easily without the knowledge of rumors.  So, it's agonizing, more agonizing than common family games.

The modified rule is great.  It does increase player interaction and reduce luck in the game.  

The game is nicely produced.  The tiles are sturdy.  The camels and explores are nicely crafted.  The rumor board and caravan board are effective, too.

It is Settlers of Catan, but with a Star Trek theme and the added character cards. The character cards are a great addition to the game that give people more choices and make it less likely that you have a turn where you can't do anything. The plastic starbases are neat. I still prefer the original theme, though.

-- ie. three more than one's last Catan rating. The Star Trek connection has almost no meaning other than to give titles to the character cards. The benefits of these cards, and the decision to switch characters or stay with the one you have, elevates this Catan above the rest. The downside is the old feeling of not getting anywhere, which is extremely frustrating and very bad for children unless they are paragons of self-control like me, however advancement can come suddenly & generously thanks to those cards. For example, Sarek plus water may be a way to win if you draw Starfleet development cards early. The development deck seems even more powerful than before.

It has fantastic production quality.  Really good pieces and really good hex tiles.  The theme was nicely done.

Complaints: All the starships and the outposts are at the same height, so they all blend together.

It's identical to Settlers of Catan except for the character cards.  It would have been better if they added some kind of extra Star Trek specific mechanic.

The game plays exactly like Catan, which may or may not be a good thing. Rolling the dice, waiting for your number, doing nothing, rinse, repeat. Still, the theme fits the game surprisingly well, and the character cards, the only new mechanic in this version, are a welcome addition. They are well-designed and help speed up the game (thankfully). Bits are nice, the art is uneven (beautiful on the cards, not so much on the hexes, and card backs are disappointing), the rules could be better organized and the tray sucks.

RATING: 7.5
  I very much like Settlers of Catan so got this as a means to entice my girlfriend into playing it. The game is exactly the same except with the addition of the character cards that just a little flavour.

  People seem to be complaining about the playing pieces, yet I find them to be excellently moulded and look lovely. 

  The recource names are confusing so we have adopted a tact of simply naming the colours, "Anyone got any white? I have yellow and blue to trade."

  Another aspect that works against this version is the lack of seafarers expansion, seafarers is a must expansion that is sadly lacking in this one.

  Overall, it is very pretty and a good way of introducing trekkies to the splendour of catan.

Going back to Catan after almost 6 years was quite fun. I was mostly curious how will it feel in the Star Trek universe and it's really cool. The components are on one side amazing (the ships) and on the other side below average (cardboard). The new concept of captains adds something new and fun to the game and even though it's the same Catan universe recycled, I cannot stop wanting to play with the space ships. Overall, nice experience.

Fair version of Catan; Addition of cards makes play slow for now because we don't know all the strategies.  It's also hard to remember which color planets is which resource...and same for names.  Mostly, we revert to who has RED um...bricks...up...you know.

Personally I prefer this version to the base Catan, though I have yet to play base Catan with any number of expansions, so I can't say for sure. Anyway the setup and flow of the game is quite similar, but the components have been changed to reflect the Star Trek theme, and they are much more attractive. Still an elegant design, but I love the addition of the Support character cards which you can swap throughout the game, they just add another, if thin, layer of depth to an already solid experience.

RATING: 6.5
Settlers of Catan, in space. Special abilities on the Character Cards are almost entirely taken from Cities & Knights Development cards.
Otherwise it's the same game so if you dislike Settlers and/or Star Trek this is not the game for you.

I refuse to play with the commander duder guys now. They just add feel bads and clunkyness to an old classic. As I am not the hugest fan of Catan, (still like it a lot) this is my preferred version simply because of the Star Trek theme. Just play it like any other game of Catan and keep Kirk and Spock to the side.

I love the Catan games, and like Star Trek, but this one just didn’t really meet expectations. I usually end up playing this game with basic Catan rules, throwing the “Star Trek” version specific cards aside. Some of the cards that are specific to this version of Catan were so overpowered, or some so useless, I just felt like the mechanics of these took away from the beauty of Catan. They made it overly complex with no added benefit. The instruction manual does not do a good job explaining these extras, even for experienced Catan players. I still have fun playing this game, but I’d trade it in a heartbeat for the regular Catan game, just so I could build on it with expansions for 5-6 players.

Retheme of the Settlers of Catan.  However, the retheme is excellent.  It's not just pasted on like most monopoly rethemes.  It mostly make very good, well-thought out sense.  The outposts, starships, and starbases are very cool.  I also greatly enjoy the one different mechanic, the role-selection cards.  It adds an element that not only speeds up gameplay, but is also thematically interesting.  I'm impressed.  Could of been horrible, but it's very good.  If you like Star Trek, this is definitely worth having in any collection.

I've played a lot of [i]Settlers of Catan[/i], including the [i]Cities and Knights[/i] and [i]Seafarers of Catan[/i] expansions. I think it's a great game and I rarely pass a chance to play.

I picked up [b]Star Trek Catan[/b] because I'm both a [i]Star Trek[/i] fan and a [i]Catan[/i] fan. The plastic components of STC look great, but are fragile. I have already broken two of the pieces in a half a dozen plays. However, the best part of the game is the character support cards, which gives a player more options, and can keep a player in the game despite bad dice rolls.

STC is now my [i]Catan[/i] game of choice when playing "vanilla" [i]Catan[/i].

RATING: 7
I love Catan, but I really prefer it with Seafareres or (especially) Cities & Knights.

Nevertheless, the role cards do add a new dimension of strategy that I really like. Some roles are obviously more coveted than others (and holding onto one card to prevent others from benefiting from it themselves is an art in itself), but all can be useful in some circumstances. 

I have never liked the development cards in base Catan, and I still hate them here. If they made a version of Cities and Knights for this edition (with the Romulans as the invading barbarians!), I would probably love it.

I have not yet had a good experience playing (any) Catan. This was a gift. The one time we played this, we didn't bother learning the updated rules, instead playing it just like classic Catan. I don't enjoy the mechanics of this game; I think the singular chance element ruins it.

Even though I like sheep (and who doesn't?!), I just can't get into building roads and settlements in normal Catan. However, I get very excited about building star-ships, outposts and star-bases in this Star Trek version!

I found this more similar to regular Catan than Starfarers, but it does introduce a few of the Starfarers elements in the form of crew cards.  These crew members can be used by any of the players, but not forever, and only 1 at a time.  It definitely seems to make the game play a little faster, and then you have all the basic Catan elements.

The role selection is definitely an improvement over base Catan, and the roles are well designed to fit the Trek characters they represent.

Good game, haven't played Settlers of Catan but this seems to be a good variation.  On the plus side, I believe that the role cards do add quite a bit more variety than the base game.  However, I think the theme is just a wee bit forced, and the board looks more cluttered than regular Catan, largely because of all of the clear plastic bases.  Fun game, great introduction to Catan, for someone that long seen and heard about the game but have only first played it.

RATING: 6.5
Good re-theme of the original. Actually more enjoyable than Settlers because of the character roles, which add a slightly deeper level of strategy. They solve the problem of waiting around turn after turn for your numbers to come up and because of them, I would sooner play this version than the original.

It's still Catan, just with different graphics and the character card expansion thrown in the box. Whether that's a good or bad thing depends on your viewpoint - I'm ok with it, but don't love the graphic design and would never choose to play this version over the original Catan.

(Rating with just base game: 5)

However, adding the map set creates some interesting value - much faster to set-up, slightly changed rules, and a bunch of small but nice nods to fans of The Original Series. This is the only way to play Star Trek: Catan in my opinion.

One downside though, I have the feeling, that even after some games, its confusing to have Water, Air, Food, Titanium and Iridium as Resources and its easy to mix them up the wrong way. OHHHH MY!

This is a better game than original vanilla SoC for three reasons.  First, having the Star Trek theme just makes it "geekier".  Second, the Support cards add an interesting element not found in the original.

Re-themed Settlers with identical game play except for crew cards, though there is a "helper" card expansion for Settlers now, too.  Loses points for not having a 6-player expansion.  As a fan of Classic Trek, I'd opt to play this version in lieu of the original, but I'm usually playing with more than four.  I suppose I could combine two sets, but that would be expensive and I'd have to paint all the pieces in the second set to distinguish them.  For the "supply lines" I really would have liked to have seen ships of different races (e.g. Klingon, Romulan (classic), and Tholian) instead of all Enterprises.  Then the "robber" could be something like the "doomsday device" instead of Klingon.  But then I guess you'd have to make the helper cards generic "Captain", "First Officer", "Engineer", etc. Well, it's a nice dream anyway.

I love Star Trek. I love Catan. So why doesn't this work better?
I think the theme should have been pasted onto Starfarers of Catan instead.
I still enjoyed playing this game, though. I did, however, find it hard to see exactly where the ships were supposed to be - hovering over board on clear stands like they were.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Theme is great, love the classic Star Trek feel and the new support cards are well done. However the game suffers from a lack of design QA. The numbers on the tokens are hard to read, replacing the dots with a wider arc of a circle is harder to understand, the roads/settlements being on stands makes it harder to see the board and numbers, the need to restand everything during play just complicates matters and makes it more difficult, the pieces don't fit into the box well, the dice are hard to read. To be fair most of these are minor to moderate complaints, it's still Catan and fun, but it just lacks polish.

If you like Settlers of Catan, this game is identical in just about every way, they just changed up the theme: Space stations and ships instead of roads and cities, elements vs. resources, planets instead of terrain. But the end is the same, there is no reason to own both, I don't think. Unless you are just a collector and love little enterprise ships.

My biggest gripe having to put all the little ships on their bases for each game. Its a lame rant perhaps, but after doing it a couple times, it gets a little old. So, why not just keep the ships on the bases? Well, there's not enough room in the box if you do, meaning you would need a separate storage box just for your ships (the ships take up much more room after attached to the base), plus they might break if jammed into the box assembled.

I was kind of hoping maybe they would tweak the rules a bit or add something to it, like the many expansions to the settlers game, but nope, its pretty much just the raw settlers with a star trek theme instead.

I still like it, and prefer playing this version to the original because of the theme, but if you are expecting something more, you will be disappointed.

2017-03-21 : First play, using the proposed fixed setup. It's in essence an upgraded and somewhat improved Catan with a good dose of Star Trek - Original Series added on top. The character powers can be very powerful when used at the right time, so timing when to pick who is important. Overall, thanks to the theme and the addition of the character cards I liked this a whole lot better than regular Catan. For the moment it's a toss-up whether I like this more than Settlers of America or not. Another play required
2017-03-31 : Another play and this time I was the only one at the table who thought that this game was pretty ok - as it won't hit the table again, it goes on the trade pile. A bit of a shame really, if you want a gamer's version of Catan, this is as good as it gets.

A fun, basic game, and my wife really likes it (Trekkie), but it's not as engaging as those games that use more favored mechanisms (deck building, Ameritrash...)  Still, get my wife to play a game is worth my time with this Catan version.  I just need to pry her eyes from the rule book and its references to the original Trek series.

RATING: 7
[1 play] This is a great twist on Settlers if you are even mildly aware of Star Trek. Everything directly parallels the base game--you build outposts and starbases instead of settlements and cities, supply lines instead of roads, and your green planets produce dilithium instead of sheep, but the underlying rules don't change, just the names and look of things.

Then there is one additional thing that I thought was terrific, which is the role cards. Each card is a Star Trek character and gives some special power or benefit. You start the game with one of these and there's a gallery of further ones, so whenever you trade yours in there are several to choose from. And when you have a role card, you must use it once and may use it twice--then you trade it. This is much more fun and dynamic than having the same role throughout the game, because everyone gets a chance to use them all, and you can pick the ones that best meet your needs at a given time. 

This is really well done and adds a new level of interest to Settlers without making it overly complex.

I refused to play Catan because bartering wheat and sheep sounded painful instead of fun.  But when I saw that they made a Star Trek version, I bought it to see what the hype was all about, and was pleasantly surprised.  The addition of the Star Trek character role cards added a nice element to the game.

I like Catan, and this is Catan with a twist.  

I've seen the low scores and extremely negative comments about the way this game looks but personally I like it.  The colours are bold and strong and need to be in order for the game to work.  I have no issue with all four players using the same craft, nor do I have issue with spacecraft being used as 'roads'.  In this game they represent supply routes and that works just fine for me. 

My gaming group like this one and I think it'll see plenty of table-time.

Since my family loves Catan and Star Trek and I had a Target gift card, Star Trek Catan was snatched up the second I saw it. It's a little silly, and the ST theme is kinda clumsily mashed on top of Catan, but, hey, Star Trek Catan. I prefer regular Catan over this, but I certainly won't turn down a game.

RATING: 7.5
  It's Catan but with plastic models instead of wood.  With the additional of special expansion cards that add a small layer of complexity to the standard Catan Game.  Clearly a buyer would need to like Star Trek.  I do and I found the spaceships, starbases, planets, etc. well worth the cost.  Fine models and lots of them.  The only downside is the included cards are of a non-standard sizing and of poor quality.

The only version of Catan I own...and Im willing to bet, this will be enough for me. Finally got this game played after about a year of it sitting on my shelf. My husband was intimated by all the little pieces, so it took some convincing for him to give it a try. Honestly, it only took about 5 minutes for him to wrap his head around it. He ended up loving it, and called it a "fun little game"

I give regular catan an 8. I give star trek catan with federation space expansion a 9. I figure this is how I will always prefer to play catan. I think the additions are very good ones, and no downside unless you hate Star Trek. Note: without the federation space expansion this is an 8-8.5.

RATING: 5.263
Nice variant to standard Catan. More than just a pasted on theme, it offers a nice (and dare say quicker) alternative to game play.  Takes the standard vanilla Settlers of Catan and gives it a heavy star trek theming (which almost looks too gaudy), yet is saved and improved by the role cards. The role cards really assist in moving the game along plus give the game an extra wrinkle (at the expense of hard core trading and cornering the market of supply). Great game (June 2013).  UPDATE: To be honest, the colour layout and the fiddly pieces (the fact you have to construct them) annoys me greatly.  Now that I have the role cards for the standard game, pointless having this version,  Donated to Star Trek tragic (Rating, 5.263, Dec 2015).

The support cards are the one mechanical difference between this game and the original, and I like them. 

The theme actually works pretty well if you assume that you are playing the role of a Starfleet bureaucrat competing with your professional rivals to build up the Federation.

Maybe not the roll most fans of Star Trek would choose to take on, but somehow appropriate for a eurogame using the theme.

When I play Catan, this will be the version I prefer to play with.

Hmm, I am not sure what I think about this. I like Catan, I like Star Trek. If you like neither of these things, then avoid this game. In some ways they did a nice job with pasting the Star Trek theme, but it is pasted on. I am fine with it, because it is Star Trek. I welcome pasted-on Catan themes, especially if they come out with an Adventure Time version. The support cards are also a nice touch, and it helps mitigate when rolls aren't going your way.

The downsides are really with production for me. The board is harder to read, the storage in the Mayfair version isn't very good at all. You can keep the bases on your ships and store them in baggies underneath the plastic insert. The could have done a much better job with that. Also, there is just a weird disconnect with the terms and colors. We kept calling everything by their Catan names.

If you don't own Catan, because everyone else you know owns it, then this might be a nice option for you. I am on the fence on needing to own this.

Interestingly Starfarers of Catan mixes with the mix much more and seems a lot more interesting with more theme.

This is a great improvement over the normal version of Catan, which always seemed imbalanced. My play experience with the original is that two people continually succeed and move forward in the game while two other people sit on the side and occasionally celebrate receiving a resource card that they can apply toward nothing. The Support Cards greatly improve the play balance, offer more decisions, and generally keep everyone in play until the end. That sounds like design for a 4-player game done right to me.

I must also add that I appreciate the theme and the new pieces quite a bit. The only negative present is the fact that the pieces don't quite fit into the box well enough - which isn't a problem when you baggie things together and toss them under the plastic tray.

Star Trek + Catan. Replaces cities and roads with starbases and starships. Original series cast cards give you unique power-ups. Only complaint, would have been cooler to have federation, klingon, cardassian, romulan, ferengi and even borg ships and starbases unique for each player. Otherwise its federation "factions?" fighting it out to win?

I still play Settlers from time to time, mostly with my children and although I find it slightly boring, it's all in all still a decent game.

However, pasting the theme from a successful franchise (Star Trek) on an otherwise completely unrelated game (settling on an island) is a blatant attempt to make money without any innovation.

Klingon Bird of Prey as substitute robber?  Federation class ships as road replacements?  This is as lame as it can be, following the good tradition of "Lord of the Rings" Risk, "Star Wars" Stratego and "Pokemon" Monopoly (or whatever).  Kosmos is going down the same road Hasbro has travelled long ago.

So this is my first rating of "1".  Not because the game is broken or bad (which it is probably not) but simply because you won't catch me dead playing it.

RATING: 8.5
This is the game that made me fall in love with, and become aware of, the hobby. I had played Catan a few times before this, but never went out and bought it. This was given to me as a gift and it triggered something in me that Catan hadn't. 

The support cards add a depth of strategy that is not immediately apparent. In addition they make the game play, reliably, much faster than vanilla Catan. Anyone who says the support cards aren't balanced just hasn't played the game, or equivalent Helpers of Catan expansion, enough. Yes at first, shallow glance McCoy, and to some extent Sarek, seem overpowered. These cards are powerful, don't get me wrong, but if your opponent(s) are able to hog this card then you are doing something wrong. If they have just used their McCoy for the first time, and it is your turn, get another support card which can be used any turn without fail. Examples include: Christine Chapel, if any player has more VPs than you; Lt. Uhura, if you want to force trades (you can also declare a resource that you know the player doesn't have); and, most reliably, Rand which you can use to convert 2 resources of a kind to a resource if any kind any number of times (including zero). Any of these three strategies can reliably be used to ensure you getting McCoy before your opponent. If everyone does this you don't need to do it, but you can easily win without McCoy, even with a heavy DV strategy, if you play your cards right.

Another aspect of the support cards is that you can really mitigate the impact of bad rolls on your ability to play each turn. This was true for base Catan to a good extent, if you want to know how I'm sure there are strategy guides,but the support cards only add to this. More strategy, less luck, what's not to like about the support cards?

The theme is great, especially if you are a Star Trek fan. I believe that comparing this with the base vanilla Catan analytically and it is a clearly superior game. But this brings me to a complaint, more about the publisher than the game, there is not nearly enough expansions. 

If you know you like Catan a lot and want to get lots of expansions, you don't mind using print and play support cards, you can read German (I believe the Helpers of Catan were not released in English), and you aren't dying to have the Star Trek TOS theme then it would be silly to get this game instead. But if at least one of the above things is not true then this is a better buy/value in my opinion.

First off, Star Trek Catan has really wonderful bits. There, got that off my chest!

I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Catan, and I think that the game tends to overstay it's welcome and be a little too luck-reliant.  That said, it IS a classic gateway, and there are a lot of very clever things about it, even though there are also entirely too many versions and expansions for what I think is a somewhat flawed game.

Star Trek Catan works to fix some of the 'broken', at the same time as it enchants the Trekker/Trekkie with this latest reimplementation.

Perhaps the best thing- even better than the great bits- that this does is to offer Trek Support character cards which help to offset the 'Catan Dice-Hate-Me' rolls that I always seem to get when playing. These also offer some added strategy points to the play, and at least 50% make some sense from a character persepctive.

I still think this game overstays it's welcome- and that's playing 2-4 players, because IMHO 5-6 player Catan basically sucks- but this version does work to fix some of the biggets flaws in the base game at the same time as it offers more attractive bits and theme, and that means a lot, even to a classic.

Starting this at a 7, after a first 4-player game.

Settlers Of Catan done with a Trek theme: robber's now a Klingon, resources are ship requirements, roads are starships and settlements star bases.

This only gets a 6 due to the following:
I found the design and the names of the resources a bit difficult to get my head around but it didn't stop me from enjoying the look on the table.
Shame the production quality of the basics was quite poor. The Cards were very flimsy for the resouces, the card stock used for the board pieces didn't feel up to Catans usually high standards. Enjoyable but won'r rush to play this again soon, at least this version anyway!

RATING: 7
Nice enough, and the roles do change things a bit.  While nothing was 'wrong', I felt like the production values were merely okay.  The cards have very small print.  The insert didn't work for storing the game.  

I'm hanging on to it for now, but admit I like the earlier vanilla edition of the original Settlers I have better.

RATING: N/A
In Star Trek: Catan, players start the game with two small Outposts at the intersection of three planets, with each planet supplying resources based on the result of a dice roll. Players collect and trade these resources – dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water – in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities.

On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources.

It's Star Trek and it's Catan, this is true. Nothing much changes from plain old Catan except some graphic design changes to fit the Star Trek theme (i.e. different resource names, star ships instead of roads, etc.) except for the addition of the different power cards that all feature various characters from the original ST series. Each character gives the player an ability they can use twice before having to turn it in and select a different character. The abilities were nice, and definitely added some speed to the game. Overall it was one of the best Catan experiences that I have ever had. Catan in general is rather boring to be honest, but this was a nice take on a classic game.

Settlers of Catan is the game that got me addicted to board gaming after my childhood. I played for the first time in college and was pretty addicted for a while. We lovingly referred to it as Satan (pronounced normally even though it's less funny that way). 'Nuff said.

I did trade away my copy because I never had the desire to play it.

It's still your grand daddy's Catan, but with a twist of rule enhancing (not breaking) characters; and they're surprisingly balanced and useful. The theme is no more useful to this game than it would be for Monopoly, but the character twist, while not a necessity, would have been nice as a stand-alone for the original game.

That all being said: This is my go-to Settlers.

RATING: 6
Type: 3-4 player area control resource and set collection based on dice rolls; very little direct interaction.

Best Player: 4 players
Weight: light/medium
Duration: 60-90 minutes
Notes:
Special ability cards to read and understand; but minor
2d6 dice rolling
player interaction with optional resource trading
Not many catch-up mechanics beyond luck of dice rolls
Pretty luck-based as long as players expand intelligently to good planets.

Star Trek Catan is my first dive into a Catan game, and I think might be my only dive into it. Not because the Catan style of game wasn't enjoyable, but just because from what I've read the Star Trek variant is one of the better ones out there.

The boards are a fantastic romp through the history of the original Star Trek series. The ships are excellent and the character cards really add an amazing bit of depth to the game and even flavor, especially giving players a chance to ham it up a bit as they use their abilities or trade them in.

The game is suitable for 2-4 players, but it's not nearly as exciting with 2 players as you do not get in each other's way much at all, and you really only can be a jerk to the other player when moving the Klingons around. Even worse, the trading mechanic becomes nearly useless. Even at 3 players, this game can drag at times, making 4 player groups sort of a must.

The expansion is a good purchase if you have a regular 3-4 player group the likes the base game, especially as some rules change for the better and the expansion boards are larger. This means less outright blocking of supply lines, but also slower expansions as the rules force starport building if you want to keep making a longer supply line.

If someone likes board games, likes Star Trek, or likes Catan, or even really any of those two things; this game will be a pleasure to play, but only if you have 4 players willing to get into it.

I have never played a Catan game before this, and I was very intrigued to play it when my brother brought it home. I had always seen it on store shelves and always thought that I might want to play it one day. This is the game Risk wants to be. This is the game that Monopoly wishes it was. It's a strategy game that doesn't feel like you're not in control of the game, and it's a trading game that people actually will trade in. My rating may increase or decrease over time, but after my first play I must say I was impressed, and at long last have that one long multiplayer in depth game in my collection.

My love of Star Trek would have to be considerably greater than it is to rekindle my interest in Settlers of Catan. There is nothing new to the game itself in this thematically rough retooling, apart from some helpful personalities reused from one of the countless expansions. Nice starships though.

The strange decision to press the base Settler game instead of the infinitely more suited Starfarers drops the rating by one compared with good’ol Catan.

Played one four player game - didn't get to finish.  

The character cards added quite a bit to the game length.  The move from playing the base version of Catan was a bit painful, getting the resource types mixed up.  Honestly I'd rather play the base version.  While the character cards do add a bit more strategy / complexity, I'd rather try out one of the regular expansions (eg seafarers or knights and cities).  

While the components fit snugly together (a criticism with the base game), they are quite garish, and it is easy for the pieces to get knocked over by an errant dice roll.

Nice for a Catan experience that feels like something different. Support cards are a cool idea, though some of them seem to have a lot of fine print. Confusing to try to use those while you're also trying to remember 'Do I need Dilithium or Tritanium?'

I'm thinking about using the ST: C pieces on a regional Catan board (Delmarva, Georgia, etc) just to really muddle up the themes... Kidding. Mostly.

I like Catan and I like Star Trek, so I was thrilled to see someone combined the two.  For most part it is just the basic Catan game with a change in artwork.  Instead of harvesting resources from terrain you harvest them from planets, instead of a settlement you build outpost which you can eventually upgrade to a starbase.  The Klingons go around the board attacking people and stealing resources.  I found myself confusing the artwork for water and oxygen resources quite often when trying to build.  I don't know how many times we called the food resources gold. I wish I can post a picture to show you why the confusion.

The addition to the game is the use of character support cards based on the Original Series.  Some cards allow you to build with less resources.  Some cards allow you to steal resources.  I was confused why Nurse Chapel allows you to steal a resource...it does not seem to fit the character.  There are cards like Spock (allows you to get any resource if the roll does not produce resources for you) which are more valuable in the beginning of the game.  There are cards more valuable at the end of the game like Kirk, which protects you from discarding down if a 7 is rolled.

Overall, I think a person can win using the standard Catan strategies without using the support cards.  The game will be a treasured addition to any Trekkie library but will not see the same gameplay as a regular Catan game.

So this is basically Catan, but with the Helpers of Catan cards included and a significantly worse graphic design... Hmm. Why wouldn't I just play the original version instead? And since I rarely play Catan at all, why would I ever choose this version?

Ah-ha! Because the Federation Space Map actually turns this simple re-skin into a cool variant of Catan. If you add the map expansion, my rating jumps several points and I'd be happy to play. It's a "must own" expansion, if you ask me.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----

A rethemed Catan with a new element: the character cards, they add powers you can use up to twice and then replace your character with another one.

Surprisingly, the powers are strong enough to make a difference and because of this, the characters become a major element of the game.

The ships are cool, but I don't like the overall aspect, it seems somewhat confusing (I have not seen it Live yet).

Still, there are not enough differences with the vanilla Catan to make it worth to buy.

I rate it slightly higher than Catan because I think the variable powers of the cards is definitly an improvement, but I might change that when I get to play it and see how the character powers interact (Spock is too powerful, but I'm not sure if that can unbalance the game, because players must change their characters after 2 uses).

Star Trek Catan is a Settlers of Catan variant that is based on the Star Trek original series.  Most of the changes are pure window dressing--settlements are outposts, cities are starbases, roads are starships, the resources all have more Trek-appropriate names, etc.  The only rules change is the introduction of character cards, which provide special abilties.  Once a character's ability is used, it can either be flipped so that it can be used a second time, or traded in for a card from a display of unused characters (after being used a second time, it must be traded).  The abilities are things that you might see in other Settlers variants--robber protection, draw a resource if you produce nothing, re-route a road, etc.  On the whole, the game plays almost identically to the original Settlers.  However, there were some changes I didn't like.  Uhura's special ability (force someone to trade) was really jerk-ish (I don't recall Uhura being this much of a jerk in the TV show), and caused people to not want to tell everyone what cards they had.  Having all those cards available at once in the display (there were like 6-7 of them) was a bit of information overload, too.  Additionally, there were a number of graphic design elements I didn't like.  Plastic standees for everything (including roads!) made the board appear very cluttered.  Resource cards and development cards have very similar card backs.  For some weird reason, they decided to switch the colors of the analogues for grain and sheep.  In short, I prefer the original game.

The player power abilities on the rotating role cards adds a fun new flavor to Settlers.  It makes the game much more forgiving too.  The cards are the only difference to actual game play, but the components are much cooler than original Settlers.

It hasn't crossed my table until now because I am just not that into Star Trek. GASP- the horror. Nah It is cool and I have enjoyed the recent movies in the past few years. I don't presume to know the characters or habits of the show, however. This game introduces characters and special abilities. Playing with 2 people who know the game very well and Ron who picks everything up very quickly- I had a hard time adjusting. People seem to like the characters but I quite hated them and they were flipping between players like it was their business, to me it added too much chaos. I haven't played most of the Catan expansions except for Cities and Knights which I also hated. I just didn't enjoy what was "new" here. I like basic Catan and that is good enough for me. I did like the bit though- very cool bits! It is still Catan at its heart so I rate it OK.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's Catan with role cards that are Star Trek Original Series characters.  It's interesting, but the tie-in to Star Trek is weak at best.  On the other hand having a crap ton of Starships is pretty cool.  I really feel like they can come out with more expansions for this that make it more Trek like.

I've played a lot of Settlers of Catan. To play this we use the Star Trek: Catan – Federation Space Map expansion. The map was wonderfully balanced, and the role cards that Star Trek Catan comes with helped a ton to mitigate the luck problems I used to have with Settlers. All in all, this is my favorite iteration of Catan so far. I wish the planets that produced the same color resources were colored a little more similarly, and it would be cute for the plastic ships that replaced roads to look differently from each other, since the score tracks are for Klingons, Romulans, Vulcans and Federation, but those are minor complaints.

This game is great.  Originally I was skeptical because I assumed it was just a simple re-skin in an effort to make more money.  But there are a few mechanics (mainly the character cards) that keep the game from completely screwing you in the dice rolls.  It's really nice to add a little bit of strategy instead of just "well, my numbers didn't get rolled, let's just wait longer".

Love vanilla flavor, plain, old Settlers?  It's still in there, mostly unchanged, beneath a gorgeous veneer of Space themed artwork.  Want a little help from the crew of the original series of Star Trek TV shows and movies?  There is a pool of character cards there to help space explorers on their way to victory.

OK variant that I know won't see much play. I much prefer the originals. I like the addition of the crew cards, but it doesn't do enough to change the base game. This one is also too time consuming because of setting up the ships on their bases; seems to almost take as much time doing that as it does to play the game. I'm a Star Trek fan, but this doesn't cut it for me. Glad I have it in my collection, but it will be collecting dust.

My only gripe is that there should be a TNG version, too!

RATING: 7
If you don't like Catan, the Star Trek version will not help with that since it plays exactly like Catan. But if you like Star Trek or space themes in general, you will likely prefer this over the classic. The space look is fantastic. The only difference to the original rules are the added helper cards (the Star Trek characters) that give you an additional power each round and that you can switch after using. They are a great addition and make the game more balanced, especially with 4 players Catan could be very unforgiving when your start off placement was a bad choice, here you can make up for that and never fall too far behind. I like that. Still, I was a bit disappointed by how much this game was the same as Settlers, I was hoping for a few 'space' peculiarities, the support cards as good as they are, are a too little to justify this game for me, therefor only a 7 in rating.

I've had the original Catan game for a long time, and never really found reason to buy a new copy for myself...

... until now.

The addition of those "role" cards (ie, Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Uhura, etc.) is really good, and adds a new aspect to the game that I enjoy.  I'd say it's a great upgrade to the original Catan.

Plus, I now have cool starships and starbases to play with

You can argue that Catan is Catan is Catan, and on some level that is true. This game keeps the basic mechanics, slips on a Starfleet uniform, and boldly goes. What makes this version unique (and my personal favorite Catan) is the addition of the crew cards which you are forced to rotate as the game progress. This extra layer of strategy makes Catan all the more enjoyable.

Catan  has original and great mechanic viz: the numbered resource generating areas. It also has clean rules, and ergonomically it works well. I also really do like the crew members and their added powers. if you like original Catan, then you should play this. 

However:  almost all the rest of the design choices are bad so that they create something that is: entirely too long, not enuf meaningful choices (it is incredbily repetitive asking for the same trade material that no one has); a king maker aspect that is ludicrous for a 2+ hr game, an endgame that bogs down, too much info on how close players are to victory (see kingmaker); moving the Robber/klingon is repetitive and is clumsy design choice, having the robber take cards from people makes trading tedious and not too interesting, the 2 Monopoly cards are game breaking etc. i am done with this genre. 

But again if you love Catan, the star trek members/abilities are very nice.

It's basic Catan with a skin slapped onto it. If you like Catan - this almost is the same game, just with some cards with abilities added. If you leave those out the only difference is the artwork and the names for the resources.

Models are of mediocre quality but the upgrade from "outpost" (village) to "space station" (city) by slapping on a part on top is pretty neat.

Virtually identical to the original Catan, but reskinned. Adds Character cards, which grant you a special power while you hold it, and you can change them out after using them. This speeds play a little and gives greater balance so that there are fewer runaways. It does still suffer from the same major problem with original Catan, namely the lunacy of RNGesus, but the cards lessen the impact of this slightly.

I'm told this game can be expanded too.

Disclaimer - This is the only version of Catan I have played.  

Based on other user comments, it sounds like the major difference is the Star Fleet Resource cards, made up of 10 or so Original Series characters.  Honestly, I can't imagine playing the game without these, as they are an awesome element of the gameplay.  They give you options, which are badly needed in a game with a random starting board.

If you haven't played Catan before, or are wondering if this mechanic is worth it, I would say a resounding YES.  Really looking forward to getting this on the table again.

It's [thing=13][/thing], re-skinned.  …plus character cards of which you have and use one at a time; each has two charges, and you're only allowed to switch to another character upon using the one you have.

The star trek role cards and the theme earn it half a point, but it's STILL Catan, a game I pretty much loathe.  Catan just ain't for me, no matter how you design it.

Perfecta adaptacion. Es hermoso de verlo armado y el jugaro con los presonajes de la serie es algo que le da movilidad al juego y es muy dinamico

We love Catan.  The Star Trek theme doesn't bring much to it, but star ships are more fun than little sticks.  Even if they are more difficult to store.

It takes the euro out of of catan. If you love Star Trek and/or space theme, it's a must have. The support cards add a new layer of strategy too

Is there ever enough Star Trek? No. No, there is not.

Light Filler Game, Quick and Quite fun to play. You need to be quick on the draw for the truck that you need because if your the last one picking then you'll have to draw a blind one from the stack sometimes you get lucky and get a truck you can work with other times it's a horrible draw.

Now that was fun! You have to quickly determine how much space the blocks you have received for the round will fit into any of the trucks on the table, except the one in front of you. I was actually able to win the game by taking the face down truck from the stack in half the rounds! Lucky, I guess. Another game that is great for kids and adults and any combination of the 2! Update: I was just going to lower my ranking for Pack and Stack because of the terrible way trucks are selected in the base game (lots of jammed fingers!). However, I found a great solitaire variant here on the Geek that breathes new life into this game. I love solitaire variants, bring me more!! (Factory Fun is still the best for solitaire, IMO)

Lots of fun, though both the packaging and price are too much. The components could more than comfortably fit in a box with a quarter or less of the volume of the one it comes in, and it really shouldn't cost more than half or so of what it does. Fortunately it's fun enough to overlook these quibbles, and the components are attractive and well-produced in typical Euro fashion, if unremarkable.

RATING: 3
Zack Pack is a good example of how a nice idea can be badly spoiled by poor rules: as a matter of fact the game betrays a certain European obsession for points and pointless complexity that looks like they enjoy penalizing the players just for playing.

In this game you roll some dice to get random bits of wooden sticks: then you have to frantically pick a truck to be loaded with them but you have to do so not by choosing between the two trucks you got at the beginnig but by stealing it from the other players’s. At this point, the player who chooses last is senselessly forced to pick a random truck from the deck, instead of being content with what little is left on the table. Moreover, just a few of all the available trucks can be loaded with the biggest forniture, which is likely to be left out, thus resulting in a heavy loss of points: actually you lose points so easily in this game but there’s no way you can gain them back, even if you manage a perfect load. 

The result is, you feel like the game is trying to keep you away from playing, instead of showing itself somehow attractive: I know this is just a matter of tastes, since many other players surely enjoy this game exactly because of its pointless rules, but this is more than enough to prevent me from wishing to play Zack Pack again.

Rating for two players (which isn't noted on the box).  In reality, the game did not work very well with two.  I don't feel the game will work well with people having two trucks as it seemed that you did not have enough blocks to come close to filling two trucks.  I think the game will be fun, just with 4 or more players.

Juego para no jugones.. de "visión espacial". Se trata de cargar camiones con determinado numero de fichas, optimizando el espacio utilizado. Cada hueco que no se llene del camión supone una penalización, pero si además hay piezas que "sobran" la penalización es mayor aún. No tiene tablero ni nada, tan solo unas cartas que representan el camión a llenar.
Juego sencillo, fácil de jugar y fácil de explicar. Sin pretensiones.

As a fan of dexterity / speed type games like this, I was disappointed by this game.

It seemed to be lacking anything beyond "I hope there's a card out there that will work for me".   If there was, you were fine.  If not, tough.

Overall, not really much of a game, and I was bored well before the end of the game was in sight.  Have no desire to play this one again, a rarity in my ratings!

RATING: 7
A very light, puzzly, game of quick thinking.  Roll some dice to see how much of what sizes of furniture you have to fit on a truck.  Then, flip some trucks and scramble to grab the optimal truck for your furniture before someone else does!  The more efficiently you can pack your furniture, the less points you lose!

The exercise itself isn't incredibly awesome, but the fun factor really comes from making fun of someone when they do an absolutely terrible job of packing their truck (which happens fairly often since sometimes there's absolutely nothing you can do about it).  And for me, that was quite a bit of fun.

A game about spatial stacking of rectangular shapes? Not bad. The theme fits the mechanics pretty well. And the 3D aspect of planning how the shapes will fit adds a nice challenge.

For a first play our group selected trucks in order instead of a "mad dash" grab for trucks. I'd actually rather play the simultaneous and mad selection, as the last person in turn order can get pretty screwed with the remaining truck sizes.

Solid family game. Nothing I need to own, but I'd happily play it. Only knock is that scoring is a bit of a pain when you have to imagine units in the void/space of the truck.

This is a great little puzzle game with a snatch and grab component that requires players to make choices quickly.

Grab the dice and try and redeem yourself next game!

Could be a great game but too light. Any random grab of a tile can lead to great points, if you try to optimise too much you'll probably miss out as there is not enough time in the round to really get the spacial awareness going. Shame.

Pack & Stack is a spatial game where players roll dice to get a variety of blocks that are 1-5 squares in length and then draft truck cards that show how blocks can be laid on them and how high they can go. The idea of the game is to try and get rid of all of the blocks from in front of you and to fill the truck up as well.

Good in theory, but in reality this is just a desperate attempt to lose the fewest points possible each round, and it is almost all up to the dice and the randomly flipped over truck tiles. Sometimes you get a bunch of the super-long 5 blocks and there aren't any trucks available that can hold them. At other times you'll get hardly any blocks and the trucks are all too big.

I usually like spatial games, and yes, I know this is a kid's game, but there are just too little actual control in this game. It's amusing to see how screwed you are each round and to try and make the best of a bad situation, and yes, the game is extremely short so I wouldn't really boycott playing it, but I don't think I particularly need to play this game again either. Bad, but inoffensively so.

I enjoy this game since since I've always had a knack for spatial puzzles.  That said, the game seemed to be missing something for me - and I'm not quite sure what yet.  Somehow it just feels like there should be a little more substance there.  At any rate, a decent if not great puzzle game.  First plays were with my 2 kids (5 and 8 yrs. old) who enjoyed it, but didn't go wild for the game.  I think they need a few more games to feel the flow of the game and to understand it a bit better.

RATING: 6
In my collection the majority of games is heavy, complex stuff, aimed at the gamer enthusiast who does not mind leafing through a booklet of between 8 to 12 pages, and who makes appointments with other enthusiasts to actually play these titles. However, at times such a gamer will find himself in the company of people who would like to play a game which is simple, fun and not too difficult. Finding titles which meet those criteria is hard, as there is a fine line between 'simple but too silly' and 'simple, a tad silly, with a bit of bite yet still fun'. Zack & Pack falls into the latter category.

In this game you try and fill up a truck as well as possible given a random selection of various goods; you lose points for still having room left in the truck as well as not being able to load everything on the truck. Trucks are drawn at random, put on the table and then grabbed as fast as possible before the players can quietly puzzle the optimum loading configuration to their heart's desire. This is repeated until one player loses all his points he started out the game with, with the winner being the one who still has the most left. Now if you read through all the negative comments, you'll see remarks about it not being a game, that randomness can really hose you, and so forth, und so weiter. But I found it not easy to win this game at all. More than once I found myself staring at a truck I wouldn't have taken had I put some more thought in. But if [i]had[/i], I would have taken too much time and have forced to draw a random card. There is a real game here, testing a proper mental ability: that of spatial intelligence. Some people have tons of it and think it all 'obvious'. but I am not so similarly endowed.

Precisely because the puzzle is friendly, and the overall game fairly short (lasting no more than 20 minutes or so), this title works well with non-gamers, and is good material for starting up or winding down from a long session. Do not attempt to take this game as serious as the gamer's games in your possession: the tile will not survive this comparison, and holding this against it is more than a little silly. Relax, and enjoy the ride.

There's a solid amount of fun in this game, considering the only "choice" to be made is reflexively grabbing a truck when someone shouts "pack & stack". Then again, the tell-tale groans of someone who has to transport a boatload of stuff with an assortement of only the tiniest trucks available are a delicious treat for us schadenfreude-afficionados. Adding to that, being the richest (=least poor) player when the first competitor goes out of business is a very fitting win condition.

Players start each round with a random selection of different-sized goods, determine by the roll of several dice. Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods. Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck.

A fun mid-weight filler involving dice (roll to see what goods you have to load); fast slapping decisions (snatch the right truck before another player does) and spatial judgement (can you get the goods on that truck).
Strangely this game fell flat with one of my game groups, but is a riot at another. I suspect it comes down to how much table talking, trashing and laughs people are into. I probably find it a fraction long for what it is, but that's probably needed to even out the dice luck (some long loads are just not going to work well).

Very little decision making in the game. Basically, the only choice you have is a speed decision: "Which truck do I want to grab." You gotta grab it before the other players. Then it's merely optimization for putting your blocks in the truck. It's fun and simple, but strategically there's almost nothing to it.

Players roll five different coloured dice to determine how many coloured blocks they have to "pack and stack" into their truck.  Then a number of different trucks are flipped up, and players have to quickly assess which truck best fits their block needs.  The tardiest player does not get fruit cup... I mean has to take a random truck.  Players then stack their blocks into their respective trucks, then pay penalty points for blocks left over as well as unused space in their truck.  Play until someone is out of points, most remaining wins.  Cute game, in a box that is twice the size it needs to be.  Still, well designed and presented, with terrific potential to play with non-gamers.  Excellent.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty fun party game.  I thought I might not like it as I am usually terrible at games with a speed/reflex component, but I won the first 2 games. Quick visual-spatial perception can help to compensate for slow reflexes in this game. The one odd thing is the way the number of trucks used is scaled from 3-4 vs 5-6, but this is easily adjustable. Most players seem to enjoy this but really poor luck can sometimes ruin the fun for a player.

RATING: 5
Luck-heavy, spatial planning, speed game....   not really my cup of tea, but short enough to be painless.   Would be fun with kids, but I think the overall scale of the production is a little too tiny and should be slightly bigger for kids.   This is another repetitive puzzle game that is fun at first, but probably grows old quickly.   The rules for selecting trucks could be better -- the first hint that something is wrong with the rule is the fact that 4 variants are given!

Initially, I really loved this game and wanted to own it right away.  The more I think about it, the less certain am.  I think it's one of those "if the mood strikes" kind of games and not a must have kind of game.  Still, was fun and light and something I could pull out with just about any crowd.

May appeal to kids but there isn't much of a game here. It all hinges upon grabbing the right truck as there aren't much options to be explored in stacking the goods. Which is quite shocking when you think about it. I mean, really, that's it?! This game is all about a mad grab for a piece of cardboard?!

I like the easy rules, short playing time, the puzzle aspect of the game, but I don't like the way the trucks are chosen by the first to grab rule.  We tried laying out the trucks and rotating first choice--still not ideal.  We haven't played this way yet, but next time we will try drawing two cards and choosing one of the two.

It's a cute game.  I'm sure Dave would like to see a bidding mechanism or a negotiation of some type for the trucks rather than an all out slap jack war, but it's cute.  I can see where 8-12 year olds would love it, although they may need help with the math.  I could also see math teachers or science teacher also using this game to illustrate volume.  Good game - although its more on the party gameish side of gaming.

Pack & Stack feels somewhat like a cross between Factory Fun and Rumis, but a lot simpler than either. Since the only decision in the game is which truck to grab each round, there is quite a bit of administrative overhead in relation to actual playtime. I don't actually find it overbearing, though. More seriously, however, without any variant or house rules the scoring feels pretty arbitrary, especially (but certainly not exclusively) for the slower players. I much prefer either of the two aforementioned games in this category.

RATING: 5
A nice idea but somewhat fails in its execution. A blend of dice luck, quick reflexes, and visual-spatial skills; I never felt like the mechanics really jelled together. Again, a nice idea but there were several problems: waiting for the dice to come around was a bit painful; dice rolls vs. truck pulled were so random that even the quickest reflex might not be able to do anything about how random everything is. In fact, that last part is what makes the game a bit of a failure. I did like the scoring mechanic and simple puzzliness of the game. Overall, this might work better for kids but the two-fold randomness just makes this a lost cause in my opinion.

Sort of wish I hadn't bought this one. Got pulled in by the box artwork I think. Happened before I knew much about BGG, and researching. Might be fun to play with some youngsters though. It requires 3 people to play it, although there is a 2 player variant somewhere. 

It's a bit of dexterity game in that you must grab available pieces from a pile of wooden chunks and attempt to stack them on your trucks.

Rules are simple to explain, but you need to be quick to grab the right truck...if it's even out there.  There is a fair amount of luck in the game with the selection of the truck to be loaded combined with what you roll on the dice.

Easy stacking game.  Bit random, but a bit of fun.  Thought there would be more of a dexterity element - its more of a quick-3d visualisation process to be able to get the right truck quickly - you need the speed process, otherwise you could sit there and count the ways. My 10 and 13 year old enjoyed.  Should go down well as a humorous filler.

I suppose I was hoping for a bit more with this, as I tend to enjoy visual spatial games. I should have investigated it more deeply before I bought it.

Can be fun with the right people, however, I will not be the reason this comes to the table very often.

My main sticking point is the "flip and grab" element to this game. Come to think of it....I don't seem to care for most games that use something like this.

Q: "Hoping for more", like what?

A: Probably more focus on elements that give the game its name. Should they want to give it a more fitting name, it should be called "Assess and Grab" instead.

No real decisions to be made, as there really is only one way to optimally stack cargo into the trucks.  The speed recognition aspect is either "feast or famine". Grab the right truck, and you score big.  Miss out by a fraction of a second, and you get hosed.

Family game, easy to learn and play.  Nice components.  May be a bit pricey for what you get.

The Action/Dexterity must be for the rush to not be the last one to grab a truck once they are revealed...  It's more family friendly when you play with the optional rule which allows you to choose a truck off the table when you are last; takes a few seconds longer, but gives the 3D challenged players a better chance.

This is a pretty decent spacial puzzle game. Luck is too high for my taste though... first a dice roll for your goods, then a card draw for area. Seems like erring on the side of too much area is always a good idea.

Simple game of volume packing optimization. Each turn, each player rolls a number of special dice to determine how many wooden blocks they get. Each rectangular block ranges in length from 1 to 5 units, with the height and width being 1 unit. Each player gets a cardboard template face-down, which represents a "moving truck" with an arbitrary layout in the truckbed and height number (number of blocks that can be stacked on the truckbed). Simultaneously, the templates are turned face-up, and then there is a mad dash to pick another template other than your own from another player. Players then stack and pack the rectangular blocks, while conforming to the truck template shape, and not exceeding the height constraint. Each cubic volume not filled results in a loss of $1, while each unplayed block is $2 x the volume of the block. This is paid to the bank. Whoever manages to pack most efficiently, thereby losing the fewest coins gets $10 back. The game ends when one player goes bankrupt (all players start with something over $50 or $100). The player with the most $$$ wins.

Fast, furious, fun filler. Not to be taken seriously, as there is too much luck with the dice. A bad roll will inundate you with huge blocks that you cannot possibly pack onto a truck, provided you can find and grab one of the right size and shape.

Update (12/18/09) 2 plays: While it is a good icebreaker, I wouldn't want to play this after another light game. It was too idiotic to satisfy my itch for a heavier game after I had just played Trias.

Update (08/17/10): Some members of my gaming group just shake their head when this is suggested. We all know why... Downgrading to a '3'.

Update (01/20/12): Let's just bury this POS and call it a day. It's a '2'.

AKA Gepakt & gezakt. Bokkensprong 19/12/14. Doel: optimaal stapelen van goederen in vrachtwagen. Iedereen gooit met gekleurde dobbelstenen om te bepalen hoeveel pakjes van elke kleur hij krijgt die beurt (vb. wit: 1x1x1, tot donker blauw: 1x1x5). Iedereen legt ook twee vrachtwagens gedekt voor zich klaar, en draait ze tegelijk om. Vervolgens kies je asap een vrachtwagen van iemand anders, waarvan je denkt dat de grootte het best past bij je eigen lading. Wie laatst is, moet blind een vrachtwagen van de stapel nemen ipv er zelf een te kiezen. Dan stapelt elk zijn lading in de vrachtwagen, en telt zijn strafpunten: 1 per niet gestapelde eenheid (i.e. per volume 1x1x1), 2 per niet opgevulde volumeeenheid in de vrachtwagen. Strafpunten worden betaald van het beginkapitaal. Wie het minst strafpunten heeft, krijgt 10 bonuspunten bij. Wie geen punten meer over heeft, ligt uit het spel; wie het langst overleeft, wint. Eenvoudig, maar leuk en kort spel waar snelle reactie en goede inschatting voor nodig zijn.

Speed puzzle! What a surprising game. It has some elements from games I enjoy (Ubongo, Factory Fun), but it is a lot more simpler and quicker. The theme is weird, but refreshing. The art and components are adequate.

It has a lot of uncontrolled luck, but I don’t mind in a game so light and quick, you can explain it under 3 minutes and play it under 15 minutes (perhaps because we suck at it). Lots of fun.

It is a shame Pack & Stack is so hard to get, I would like to buy a copy. I think this would be great for the family, but I also play it with my gamer friends.  For now I want to play again and I won’t say no to a game of this.

Cute little game where players try to optimize the packing of boxes (which are rectangular wooden bits that are 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 unit of length long) into trucks which have different storage capacities. The trucks have different shaped storage spaces and also can have storage heights of 1 through 4. 
It is a very light game that plays quickly, a good no-brains filler, or a good game to bring out with non-gamers.

Immediate impression is a combination of Factory Fun with Ubongo. Each player simultaneously turns over a truck and under time pressure everybody has to choose one of the other trucks (Factory Fun: choose machine). This is a little bit easier here than at Factory Fun. But I still suck at this.

The second part looks like the spatial puzzle from Ubongo. But as it is not time dependent and there is no real challenge in putting your pieces on the truck in the best possible way the Ubongo resemblance is just on first sight. Also, the construction challenge of Factory Fun is not present.

In sum, this is Factory Fun with the complex part taken out and brought to a Ubongo gamer level. It's fun to play but in comparison to the other two games there's not enough variation.

I love the artwork and the selection, loading and scoring mechanisms. The only bit I really didn't like was the truck grab when played with 5 or 6 players - there was just no time for any sort of thinking. With 3 or 4 players it didn't seem so bad, since there were more trucks available. I also prefer it with the variant that allows the last player to choose between taking a face-up truck or the top one on the draw pile. Great to play with children, and fun with adults too.

Pack & Stack should be better than it is, I was disappointed.

The theme is fun and makes sense and the components are nice (though the box is way too big, a common problem).

I also like games with a speed element.  But there are just too many things to go wrong.  The dice play a huge role in the game, and having too many pieces (or too few) can put you at a major disadvantage, depending on what cards are flipped.

But then the cards are also problematic.  If the distribution is wrong, someone is going to be in trouble.  Not being able to draw your own card is a weird rule, and also hard to enforce amidst all the chaos.  And the rule about drawing from the top of the stack seems awfully random as well.

I really wanted to like this game, but the only way I could envision playing it is with kids, but even in that situation, I would probably prefer games like Rumis/Blokus 3D or Ubongo over this.

Played as 3 player game 3 times. It was a good filler as it didn't take much time. The card picking mechanism seems to be lacking in something. Maybe a variant will fix that. Overall it's fun and short game that's easy to explain and teach.

Great spatial game that is fun and exciting. Doesn't take long to learn and delve right into playing. The price for the game makes sense due to the amount of components you get in the box, but the game just doesn't last long enough and doesn't have that much replayability that I would ever entertain owning it personally. I could generally be swayed into playing this game if I was waiting on another bigger game to start.

As far as real-time games goes, this one isn't terrible except for one problem I have with it:  theoretically, it can go on for way too long.  There should be some design element that could make it end progressively, like for example, after 12 rounds, the winner is one with the most points.  It's also weird and too much randomness for the last player to select a random truck from the draw pile - seems like too much luck there.  And, what if two people don't like any of the trucks displayed and are staring each other down in hopes of going last to draw something better? (that's a small design flaw).

RATING: 4
Enjoyable, luck filled stacking game.  Recommend getting another set of dice if you can to help speed up the game, particularly if you play with 4+.  You will get hosed at some point in the game by being unable to draw the truck you need to dump off all your pieces.  Play with the rules as written if you want a speedy game.  My first game was with the 5 piece variant and the game dragged.

There is a ton of luck in this game.  Luck adverse people should NOT play as luck comes in heavy doses.  Very simple mechanics and quick gameplay (assuming 4 or less players) can make this a winner in the family game category.  Always fun to try and finagle your lumber into the truck you select.  It is very possible to lose 30+ points in one unfortunate truck draw.  

Just play this game for fun, knowing it will be over quickly and joke around.  To keep the game moving even more quickly, make the bonus only 5 points instead of 10.

What a surprisingly fun filler game to play, especially for families with mixed ages! the concept is very easy to explain and understand, the game flows quickly, it uses dice in an acceptably euro fashion, and the components are well produced. I can play this with my youngsters (5 and 7) as well as their grandma with no trouble, and a game plays in 20 minutes or so making it ideal in many situations.

This fits squarely in the light euro category, but as such, it's significantly underrated.

A cool game concept that needed to spend a bit longer in development, as it feels somewhat unsatisfying to play. I imagine some house-rules could improve the game. This is probably a good one for younger children if a parent helps them with the maths.

Suggested variant (I haven't tried this yet):
Sort the truck tiles into four piles according to size, shuffle each pile separately. After all players have rolled for parts, the start player turns over a tile from a pile of his choice, and may either take that, or pay 10 points to flip a second tile. Play then passes to the next player, with each player either taking an already-flipped tile for free, or paying 10 points and passing. Once a player takes a tile, he no longer participates in flipping/taking tiles and may immediately start placing his pieces on his truck.

I enjoy this type of puzzle game, but the somewhat random grab-a-truck-you-think-might-work-before-everyone-else-does ruins the puzzle aspect because there is not enough time to properly evaluate more than one or two before it's too late.  

I find similar games like Ubongo much more enjoyable because the time pressure is refocused.

Takes too long too finish. I just play with the kids (9 and 5 years old) until the truck deck is depleted.

I also modified the rules so we don't steal each other cards but a player can choose from a couple of flipped- over cards from the deck. The amount choosable is the amount of players +1. On a player's turn he is the first one to choose.

Nice enough components but not even close to a decent game. The recurrent truck grabbing is silly (attempts to fix this aspect of the game with auctions does not appeal: I mean really, who's looking to add even more auctions to games?) and the truck loading is too simplistic. So maybe okay for kids. Gave away. [1 play]

Not something that I'd play a lot with other gamers but a very good family game or filler. The game could be improved by using a smaller storage box and a grid on the trucks to show the number of spaces, particularly in the Y dimensions to make it easier to tell the 4 and 5 length trucks apart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun and light game where the players must try to stack a series of varying sized blocks onto the pack of delivery trucks that also vary in height and space.

What makes the game interesting is the 'real time' grab that the players must make for the limited number of delivery truck cards each round. 

This essentially requires the players to visualise the goods they must pack and how they could be stacked onto the trucks on offer. 

Bonuses are awarded for using all available space so picking a truck to big for your needs is not the answer either, but of course if you can't fit all the goods in then you really get penalised.

Components to this game are gorgeous too.

A game that has the potential to be better than Factory Fun, and in the beginning actually seems more fun than Factory Fun, but which has as a fault way too much random luck. It might work better if more trucks were available to choose from than the number of players, or if everyone had a hand of trucks. I ended up winning both games I played, and I didn't deserve either win. On the plus side, it's very easy to teach and pick up.

There are 2 trucks per player in the 3-player version; I do like that better. But the game does come down to spatial math skills -- not planning, not risk assessment, etc.

The idea is very simple, ultra-light, but quite nice and original. Nonetheless:
-> You just take 1 decision per round (you take it in a few seconds and each round lasts about 5 minutes)
-> The penalty for being last is huge!! And luck becomes a decisive factor there.

I also don't like the dexterity part of them (as usual), where everybody will hurry up to pick a truck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression (4- & 5-player) : There is plenty of randomness as you first get random selection of goods you need to fit on your truck and then you need to select quickly a truck that seems to fit them best. Extra space isn't a good thing but if you can't fit everything it's even worse. Sometimes you get so much stuff there isn't a van that fits them (or someone took it before you...). 

So it's not a very deep game but it doesn't matter that much as even if the box is big kosmos box this is really a filler that can be played in 15 minutes. A very fun filler I must add but only if you enjoy the speed game part of it. One of those games that are easily played a couple of games once it hits the table.

There are less choices with trucks in 5-player game compared to 4 players. I like it better when there were a little bit more trucks to choose from as sometimes you can only choose between bad choices. Also the rule about last player has to take a random truck can be very cruel sometimes. Cruel but very fun (to others).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An amazingly good block placement speed puzzle. But only after you ditch the official rules for selecting the tiles; Especially the rule for the last player having to draw from the deck is absolutely horrible.

The end condition sounds very evasive on paper, but the actual playing time is quite short regardless.

Not worth playing with more than four players, unless you get extra sets of dice. With only one set of dice, the dice rolling brings way too much unnecessary and unavoidable downtime into the game.

Also, with more than four players the original rules for the tiles are extremely bad and you'll end up with really sucky trucks almost every time. Two tiles per player is definitely a must.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick and relatively light "spatial" game, clearly in the wake of Ubongo. It has two drawbacks -it relies a lot on luck (a bad draw can ruin all the previous good playing and end the game), and being able to approximate quickly what can be done with your draw is capital to win (experienced players will smash the new ones without much effort).

Luckily, these don't matter that much if the matter is playing and not winning.

Admittedly a stupid game where the only decision you make is made in 0.6 of a second - which truck from those on display is closest to the capacity you need for your unique stack and then grab it before anyone else. After that, lose points for unused capacity and lose points for stuff you can't load. You've got to be open to it, but the game has a surprising capacity to generate laughter and satisfaction when you nail it. Too expensive for what it is, but it is a nice 20 minute opener or filler.

Unfortunately I had high expectations that this would be a fun outing. I had one moment of schadenfreude as one player loaded a couple of shoe boxes into an expansive flat top. But I feel this game will suffer like Taboo does in that as the skill increases the situation comedy decreases. Compared to other speed games like Jungle speed and Buntherum (Checkout), this design is lacking other fun elements so feels like a funniest home video. Shame as I like the theme and can visualise the poor removalists scratching their heads, but the game isn't really worth unpacking.

This is a game, I would only recommend to families (my kid likes it), but it's really just another speed game. Or in my case totally luck dependent.
I give it a 5 for a nice idea. It's just something I would likely pass, if there are some other options.

While I don't mind the die rolling to generate the load, I do mind the notion that if you get one or more of the longest pieces, there's a good chance none of the trucks on offer can hold any. That breaks the game for me.

Un filler bonito y divertido. Es menos tenso que el Ubongo y más desequilibrado; pero precisamente en eso radica la gracia del juego. Como única pega le veo la mecánica de coger los camiones que es muy a lo Jungle Speed y puede provocar algún desastre casero.

Si se toma como lo que es; es decir, como un juego ameno, rápido y entretenido para todos, sacarlo es todo un triunfo a pesar de que la mala suerte te haga perder la partida cuando mejor la llevas... lo cual, también suele ser divertido a la par que frustrante.

RATING: 5
I shouldn't overthink my comments, but can't help shaking the feeling that the combination of long blues drawn with trucks grabbed weigh to heavily on the overall game results.  The penalty for not loading alwasy encourages one to grabe a larger truck if the perfect truck isn't available.  Might get a tad better with repeated play and knowledge of the available trucks.

But games are short enough that this is a filler, and nothing more.

I can't in good conscience rate Pack & Stack any higher than I already have, because frankly it's a little dumb. There is all of one single decision to be made in any given round, and it's a single split-second one at that. The actual spatial element isn't very difficult or challenging either.

But you know what? I like it anyway. I'm not sure it's possible to ever get better at it, but there is something enjoyable about frantically grabbing for the right truck, only to see that you won't have room for half of your pieces. It's even more enjoyable when it happens to someone else.

RATING: 4
Quick little game with a very fast decision to be made five or six times before the game ends. There's not a lot of control as sometimes the luck of the dice and available trucks limits your choice to almost zero. Probably good to play with kids, but they'll need a fast hand. I'm not normally a fan of the snatch and grab type game (as someone who's experienced broken bones and torn ligaments in my fingers), so keep that in mind when reading this.

Enjoying Oakland variant (keep up to five pieces), with 50 point start, no 10 point bonus and player has to pay for all pieces if they go over five. This reduces the luck a bit and creates some semi-meaningful decisions around timing and which pieces you'll retain.

Update: This is turning out to be a fairly decent game for the kids. They get a lot of counting practice, spacial conception practice, dexterity and co-ordination practice. It turns out that my newly turned four year old can play a decent game.

One other successful variant we've tried (to reduce luck), is that when the player takes the plunge and draws from the deck, he or she can choose a level truck they wish to reject. If that number comes up they keep drawing until they receive a truck other than the level nominated.

Ha üres helyek maradnak az mínusz pontot ér, de ha kimarad némi rakomány azután is fizetned kell, ráadásul dupla árat.

Very silly race to the bottom spacial relationship game.  I like to pretend that everyone has inherited their father's company and now they are driving it into the ground.  The first person to destroy their father's dreams ends the game and the player with the most money wins.

While there is a speed element to picking the truck to pack the pressure is off once you see what you are stuck with.  

There are a number of quality variants that come with the game, so players can pick one to their preference. 

Good for a quick filler.

A fun little simultaneous play puzzle-solving race game, with a somewhat generous dose of luck. Fortunately, it plays quickly enough for that to be tolerable. Makes for a nice filler, although I do wish there was an easy way to even out the randomness of the dice rolls!

--- Summary ---
There's a stack of truck tiles, each showing a differing shape and a number (1-4) of levels. Each player starts the game with 75 VPs. 

Each round, take 1 (or 2 if 3er) face down. Players each roll several dice and take the appropriate number of sticks (length 1-5 cubes) matching the dice colors. Simultaneously, reveal the trucks. Players race to grab one (optionally, take a tile from the top of the stack). Then, without a time limit, everyone tries to place all their wooden pieces onto the truck tiles; may not place outside the borders nor above the height limit. Everyone must give up 1VP per empty hole in their truck, and 2VP per excess cube on each of their unused wooden pieces. 

The game ends when any player runs out of VP; the player with the most remaining VPs wins!

A lényeg, hogy a teherautóválasztásnál tényleg be kell tartani és tartatni azt a szabályt, hogy aki utoljára marad a választásban, az vagy azonnal felvesz egy teherautót vagy húznia kell egyet a pakliból. Ez biztosítja, hogy ne lehessen alaposan átgondolni a megfelelő teherautó kiválasztását.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - We started with 2 and kept adding people to the game and eventually had 6 which was crazy to look through the 12 trucks and grab quickly. I really like spatial thinking and this is that type of game. The fact that there's some luck in what pieces you get and what trucks comes out could ruin it, especially with fewer people. However, too many people and getting the right trucks is tremendously difficult. I think 3 to 5 players is probably best.

This is another very flexible game in my collection. Nearly anybody of any age or gaming interest level enjoys this title. It plays up to six and it's  quick to teach and play. It even looks good.

Pack and Stack is easy to get to the table and that has value for me.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5

Fun, quick, speed puzzle for all ages.  Not too puzzly, so it isn't too intimidating for puzzle phobes.  Plays fast and can accomodate more players than the box says, so it's a nice game to start the night with as everyone arrives (or to include the kids before they go to bed).  Nice components seal the deal.

We put one player in charge of handing out each color and that keeps things moving at a brisk pace during rolling and block distribution.

This was a variation on Ubongo with a three dimensional element. Just like Ubongo, players try to arrange pieces to fit into a small space laid out on their board. It's a spatial puzzle that uses the same part of your brain as Ubongo. Unlike Ubongo, Pack & Stack gives each individual player a different random assortment of pieces by rolling dice, and unlike Ubongo, the speed part of Pack & Stack involves picking which board you want, and the actual arranging of pieces is done at your leisure. Despite my feeling that Pack & Stack is inferior to Ubongo, it was nevertheless a fun game in the moment and one I wouldn't turn down playing in the future if someone else suggested it as it was at least quick and entertaining.

Players start each round with a random selection of different-sized goods, determine by the roll of several dice. Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods. Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck. Players get negative scores if the truck they picked was too large (a lot of unused space at 1 point per unused space) or too small (a lot of goods don't fit at 2 points per space of goods that would not fit). The player who gets the lowest negative score in a round gains 10 points. Players "pay" points for their negative values, and rounds continue until at least one player no longer has any points; the player with the most points wins.

RATING: 5
There's enough silly fun here that I will actually give it a decent rating. Considered strictly on its merits as a real-time puzzle game it would get something lower, probably a 3. This is because:

1. Having to take a random truck can really screw you over.

2. Some sets of items to load are much worse than others.

These issues mean you can't take it even as seriously as something in the Ubongo line. Of course one could play with variants - allow everyone to take a face-up truck, for example, and maybe give everyone the same set of items each round, or allow a re-roll of one die.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice filler if you play a set amount of rounds, with the winner being the person who received the lowest amount of negative points. Great components and easy rules make this a good game to keep players at the table after a more serious time investment. Also, this could be a good educational game for kids (for improving their sense of space). For adults, my major concern is its replayability. Definitely should have come in a smaller box.

Fun filler party game, plays very fast.

Primary skill is fast recognition- grabbing the best truck for your load. It is heavily random, which I normally strongly dislike, but the pseudo-Tetris aspect plus the fast grab somehow overrides this distaste.

If you want a more brain-based game, auctioning the trucks using points is an easy fix.  I'd recommend blind bid to maintain game speed (whoever has the least points currently wins ties).

A light filler that is like a very fun cross between Factory Fun (tile grabbing) and Ubongo (spatial puzzles). Game is just the right length at about 15 minutes, and is quite addictive! Unfortunately, is quite expensive for the class of game and the box is overly large.

If players are equal luck decides the winner. However, this game requires quick thinking, calculation or space perception. That means you mostly have one who beats the crap out of everyone else = after one play you know with 99% certainty who will take the next game. Practice actually makes you a lot better.

This is a fast paced little game.  The real-time element is unobtrusive and it's a quick play.  Very fun party-esque filler game.

Commented after one game. Very fast and kind of simple, light puzzle game. Changing the vans might get quite fuzzy, especially with large number of players and the random card you take might be absolutely wrong for you. The variation in the cars and in the dice results mean that you might get in big trouble sometimes.

Nice filler game, not to be taken too seriously. Might get better after couple of beers.

Updated after second play, the puzzle part is really small, if players crab the vans fast - then everybody just calculates the minuses. Not much fun this time.

This is a neat dexterity/spatial recognition game, but it's not without its issues.  I'm not wild with the mad grab for trucks, and I also don't like the idea of having to pick trucks from the top of the stack, since you already have to randomly receive the pieces based on the dice.  One random factor is fine, but two is not quite to my liking.  Still, it's a kind of game that I don't already have, and I don't mind it being in my collection.  I'll give it a few more chances, at least; heck, it's short, right?

This is a nifty little puzzle game that's a lot of fun even when you're losing.  Which is a good thing, because I seem to have trouble picking the right truck (the Oakland variant helps a bit with that, though).

Square box

Packing!
Stacking!
Light weight.
Low player interaction (truck selection).
Medium theme application.

Dice rolls for pieces and truck draws can be completely random and sink you fast but who cares - it really doesn't matter. Getting a high piece count roll but then getting the right truck feels great, and fitting pieces onto trucks is a ton of fun. Short, sharp and sweet enough to make terrible rolls and draws inconsequential.

Solid family/party game mixing elements of abstract thinking with dexterity and speed.  I'm not a big fan of the speed portion but it works in this game.  Nice extra that it supports six players.

I like it because it is quick, super easy, and light. I think it's a great "sandwich" game- something to play between heavier games or when waiting for friends. I suppose I tend to like games with a time limit. I do not like all visual games (example, I definitely do not like Pueblo) but ones where the aim is to see what will fit in a space I tend to enjoy, even if I am not always good at them. Perfect for what it is.

The grabbing of the trucks which happens in some tenths of a second almost decides the whole outcome combined with the roll of the dice. Still this is fun to play.

I was disappointed in this one. It has some cute puzzle elements, but the game as a whole feels pretty unsatisfying and very random. The more so given that it's a larger box, more expensive game.

Pretty fun. The box is RIDICULOUSLY large, hence the reasonably low score. This game should be $15 and should come in a Kosmos 2-player type box.

Nice little spatial awareness game with a lot of interaction between players. Not a whole lot to it, but those who are better with quick choices and figuring out how to pack the trunk of a car will probably excel. 

Friends who have only played this in a sitting or two have asked and been disappointed when I don't bring this with me to a game day, so it seems to have some lasting appeal.

I've got a pretty good 3D Processing unit up in my head apparantly because I rock at this game. I can mentally add up my cubes of space and know how big of a truck to get. It's awesome.

This is a game I need to get. So easy to teach. So instantly fun. So Physical.

5 after 1 play.

The initial rush for a truck more or less destroys the game experience. Any planning is thrown out of the window. After that, it is a solitaire game as each player tries to fit his/her pieces on the chosen truck.

Ooh, this is torturous.  Roll for the random crap you have to put on a yet-unseen truck, then grab a truck that maximizes the crap you can put on it, but minimizes the wasted volume in the truck.

Must… play… again.

A decent short game... some randomness involved with dice and luck of the draw / speed of the eye.  It's not like Crazy Eights, but you need to quickly grab the best truck available each turn before someone else does first.  It's ok...

After 1 Play: Each round takes maybe 5 minutes, with everyone rolling, gathering pieces, picking their truck, stacking the pieces and scoring, but the only real decision is which truck to grab, which lasts about 5 seconds. While the bits are nice and the idea is neat, that's not a very good ratio of decisions to upkeep.

AAAAARGH! Speedy perception is simply not for me. Exactly in the same class as Turbo Taxi and Ubongo. Some clever ideas here though.

A decent, quick set collection game.  A very interactive game where you need to go in expecting to be messed with and to mess with others.

It's been 3 years since I played the original Guildhall, so I don't remember the specific card abilities in that game, but I feel like some of them rubbed me the wrong way.  I don't find I dislike any of the card abilities in this one.  Some involve messing with opponents, but it's a fairly benign screwage and it's easy enough to return the favor.

The only ability I'm not a fan of in this game is the Bricklayer, who just takes a long time to perform since it can draw a lot of cards and you have to figure out which ones to keep and which to put on top of the deck and in what order.  It can bog the game down somewhat.

All in all, I think I like this game a bit more than the original Guildhall, though it's been so long since I played that one that it's hard for me to say definitively.  Neither is a game I feel the need to own, but I'm willing to play on occasion.

Job Faire is the same as the original Guildhall with different characters, whose abilities are just a little more complicated than the base game’s: cards would easily integrate in each other though, making every play a little more varied than the previous.

Like Guildhall, Job Faire can be moderately fun too.

Both the expansion and the base game need each other. I wouldn't say one is better than the other. The expansion adds some more options of characters giving more variety. I wish both the base game and Job Faire had bee packed together.

I owned this for a brief moment... it sat in the main box, but I never played the base game enough to break into some of these other roles. My quick read through of the rules and powers didn't lead me to believe that they were significantly different or game changing.

Adds new types of cards to use, you can use expansion alone or mix with original.  The new cards abilities are similar and have a counterpart in base game, so it's best to only use one and not both when playing.  i.e. Farmer and Tax Collector.

More Guildhall goodness. These characters are a little more complicated than the original, but I think a couple of them are really nice. I like the idea of mixing and matching cards from both sets except for the shuffling and sorting involved. Instead, I'll probably just come up with my favorite 5, and stick with them.

Disappointing sequel/expansion to Guildhall.  Several of the new professions slow the game down as players, say, look through the discard pile to find two cards they want, then decide which of their own two cards they're going to swap back for them.  A few minutes later...  

Guildhall was never a fast-paced game, but this one really makes it drag.

Döbbenetes, hogy mennyit ki lehet hozni gyakorlatilag 6 kártyából. Bőven van agyalni való, bőven van mélység az interakció meg végtelen sok. Talán ez az egyetlen hátránya is, mivel ez sok alkudozást, győzködést indukál, nomeg van benne királycsinálási lehetőség is, bár ezt minimális játékintelligenciával gyakorlatilag nullára lehet csökkenteni.

7.9 azért, mert még kell pár játék, hogy eldöntsem mennyire is jó ez játék. 7 és 9 között lesz valahol. :)
---------------

Pár játék után nem tudom mit mondjak. Egyfelöl a mechanizmus zseniális, mint ahogy azt fent is írtam. Másfelől a játék annyira feszült, annyira konfrontatív, hogy én egy percét se tudom élvezni. Ehhez az is hozzájárul, hogy "duplaolló szindrómától" szenved a játék. Aki elsőnek tol össze sort, az nagyon nagy előnybe kerül, mert a célkártyák segítségével majdhogynem minden körben össze tud tolni egy újabbat. Míg aki utolsónak tolna össze, az szinte sose fog tudni, mert a többik terülj-terülj asztalkámosat játszanak a szettjeivel. Így a nagy konfrontáció ahelyett, hogy egyensúlyt teremtene, csak egyre nagyobb különbséget eredményez, mivel mindenkinek a leggyengébett éri meg ütni, a legerősebbet meg már nem nagyon tudjuk bántani.

Ha az élvezeti értéket nézném, akkor 4-est adnék. Ha a mechanizmut, akkor 9.5-et. Legyen 6.

Only played  two 3-player games. The game was quite  interesting but the downtime was too mich for me. You can't really  plan ahead as other Players can destroy your Plans easily. In Addition you often draw cards during your turn so that you have to  consider new Information. Perhaps better as a 2-player game but here expect some serious first player advantage.

Hm. Not terribly convincing. The game badly suffers from having too many restrictions, at least in the two player game. You constantly check for good moves, and most aren't possible because they involve one or more cards already in your (or your opponent's) guildhall. The game also feels quite dry and the iconography on the cards is horrible. 
No need to keep it - I don't regret having played it once, but don't see myself suggesting it again, either.

Fans of Guildhall will certainly want to pick up this expansion. Some of the new roles are a breath of fresh air, allowing powerful card play when used correctly. There is one role, the Tax Collector, that seems a bit overpowered (giving away a card doesn't seem like cost enough to earn the amount of points it gives away), but overall these roles aren't better or worse than those in the original game - just different, making it worthwhile for veterans of the original game and nothing worth checking out the game's critics.

This is a nice, stand alone expansion for Guildhall. I'm not sure how much I like it on its own, but when used to mix new guilds into the base game, I really like it. On its own, the base game is pretty mean (which can be a good thing, but isn't always). This expansion makes it possible to tailor the guilds to fit the situation. If you want to play a less confrontational, 2 player game, you can do that now. If you want the game to be just pure evil, you can do that.

Excellent, just like the original. I prefer the original slightly, finding that the game plays a bit more smoothly because Job Faire has some cards that mess directly with another players hand, not just the guildhalls, the deck, or the discard pile.

As a standalone I like the first one a little bit more, just because some of the powers are maybe a little more straightforward and thus turns seem to be a little quicker, which reduces downtime. 

But in the end mixing them together and having more variety just makes for a great overall game, so to me it's not one or the other but they compliment each other very well.

This is a standalone expansion to Guildhall: Old World Economy. Similar in feel, but with new professions. The box can accommodate all cards from both sets.

Can play without the base game, play with it by choosing 6 professions out of the 12, or play with it in a Mega game with all 12 professions.

This is a "stand-alone expansion" in the same vein as Dominion: Intrigue--you can play a full game out of the box, or you can mix-and-match with other Guild Hall cards.  I do enjoy the Guild Hall mechanics, but I found the card mix in this set to be a little lacking.  Overall, I thought they were a little less intuitive and a little more take-that.

Initially after reading the rules and seeing the cards, I wasn't very impressed. The cards seemed like they really didn't do anything interesting. But after playing, I walked away with an appreciation of this game. It was a lot deeper than I had initially thought. The roles act much more subtly against each other and scoring a VP card at the right time really makes you think about some of your actions. I would love to play just Guildhall and eventually incorporate this into it. Rating may rise, but a 7 is probably where this will stay.

Update: After a couple more plays of this game, I'm rather impressed with it. It's light, fast and fun. Games literally come down to a turn where almost everyone is going to win. All the factions feel and play differently and I like all the hidden combos that you can do. Brilliant game. Maybe not a 9 or a 10, but it's starting to become a solid 8 for me.

Liked this. After the game we were already discussing how we could combine the characters from this one with the base game. Fun, more interactive than the base game character set.

Sometimes I wonder: did they split up a game in 2, so they'll be able to sell 2 different games, who where in fact just one?

With 'Core Worlds' for instance it's very clear that the expansion 'Galactic Orders' already existed when they brought out the base game, as the cards of the base game already had the symbols of the factions of the expansion on them. When playing Core Worlds + Galactic Orders, the game also feels "finished", like now you finally have all the components and before you just had a stripped off version.

That same feeling I had when I combined 'Guildhall: Old World Economy' with 'Guildhall: Job Faire'. OK, you can indeed play each set on it's own, but it will always be the 6 same occupations you'll use. It makes much more sense to have 12 occupations, from whom you'll chose 6 each time, giving you a totally different draw deck aka playing experience each time. So I'm wondering: did the original design had more occupations and did they just split things up? The boxes are certainly made to hold more cards then just those 6 occupations you get in each box!

Job Faire is to Guilhall what Intrigue is to Dominion, more cards requiring a decision to be made and just draggier overall.

We started with this set of Guildhall but got the basic game. Good light card game. It is all about pulling the right combos. There is some card interaction. Fully recommend to get both games to have some card variety.

See Guildhall
Stand alone with different role/action cards, can be mix and matched with the original. Job Faire actions are probably a little more complex. You have a few more options/decisions, but it is also a little less gateway friendly.

Good addition to the initial 6 roles... that said I would recommend picking up the 'Old Wold' over this one if you're only going to get one. I'm also slightly dubious about mixing them, some combinations will work, but some likely wouldn't work as well...

This is a nice expansion in that it just adds new cards.  The new cards add nice new opportunities, but I don't think you'd just want to make one giant deck out of both, but you can easily pick a grouping, mixing both sets and get a great game. (JW)

Good expansion to the original game.  This one really started to hurt my head when I tried to figure out all the new cards and how they work together.  Very different, yet if you have played the first game, easy to pickup on.  I don't think it works quite as well as the original, but works great when you mix with random cards from the first game.

This seems to be a well designed game, I just don't care if I play it at all. It's a bit less cut throat feeling than the original, since you spend less time stealing/killing all of their important guild members.

An expansion for Guildhall that also works as its own standalone game.

The only difference between this and Guildhall is a set of 6 different professions that you can play with instead, a random mix of the available 12, or with all 12 for a longer game.  I don't like playing with all 12 personally because I think Guildhall is at its best as a filler so I'm not that interested in making the game longer.

For the most part the new professions don't feel all that original even though they do different things.  The abilities are really just different ways to do the same manipulation between hands, guilds, and the graveyard.

It's nice to have variety though so you're not playing with the same 6 every single time.

A clever and fast playing game. A lot of potential for coming up with clever cardplay combos. A lot of 'take that' as you steal and forcibly trade with other players, but the game is so light and back-and-forth that it hasn't seemed confrontational. I think I like the base set a little better; the cards in Job Faire are a bit more complex and take more planning.

It was interesting, but I'm not sure it was all that compelling.  In short, I don't think this game really has any soul.  It's fast to play, and easy to teach.  I wish companies would go away from all those dumb symbols and just put text on the cards though.

Idiots.  I hate language independence, all that does is adds an extra layer of complexity that has to be taught to someone.

Almost necessary to make the base game more enjoyable, mainly so you can replace the Assassin and a couple of other roles. I've found this to be the best mix: the Weaver, Farmer, Robber, Hunter, Dancer, and Scholar.

GAME: Legend of the Burning Sands
RANK: 4145
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Poor marketing really doomed this game right from the start.  Based on L5R system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sister game to Legend of the Five Rings. I like Burning Sands even more than the original. The Arabian Nights theme is very cool.

RATING: 7
Arguably a better game than L5R, but nobody got into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An amazingly subtle CCG, which, unfortunately, was sort of ruined by the expansions, and then viciously abandoned.

More depth of play than any other CCG I can think of; and, since you draw 4 cards a turn, less luck.

RATING: 5
Yet another card game that did not take off. Nice artwork however.

RATING: 8
Not as good as Legend of the Five Rings, but still better than Magic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The balancing of its dual-resource mechanic along with its Arabian Nights feel make this a winner.  It is the L5R rules-set perfected (thought this does not mean that the available cards / factions are wholly balanced).

Trading sealed Moto & Senpet starters from Shadows of the Tyrant.

RATING: 8.5
Possibly my favorite CCG.  For me, it fixes my perceived problems with L5R (mainly slow card draw), and most of the factions were interesting to play.  Too bad some never had a chance to be developed further.

Still don't like AEG's default faction system (you can play anybody at  2) but otherwise a solid game for those looking for a long, complex, more board-game-ish CCG. Distribution started bad and became atrocious.

LBS is set in the world of Rokugan (the same as L5R) and got a definite Middle-eastern feeling to it. Think of One Thousand and One Nights nights and you got it right. Everything in the game centers on Medinaat al-Salaam, the Jewel of the Desert, a sprawling city where different factions vie for control.

The city and the river that runs through it is the only source of water in the desert and thus the one who controls the city and the water controls the desert. The city is ruled by the dread Caliph and her (yes, she’s female) semi-undead followers. Much is going on in the city and the story evolves through the sets (and is well done imo).

The art and the flavour text on the cards really capture this setting which is one of my favourite ones.

This is in my opinion one of the best CCGs ever made (along with Middle-Earth: The Wizards). You could consider it Legend of the Five Rings without the bad stuff. ;)

You owe yourself to at least try it out once, and if you’re are a CCG player to begin with, what are you waiting for? One of the best (if not the best) CCGs around! Too bad it was discontinued as there's a need for some more cards to fleshen out some factions and strategies. Still great fun to play!

RATING: 7
The best AEG game out there. While less evocative than L5R, it is more balanced, faster, and less prone to degeneration than L5R. Borrows a few key game concepts from Garfield's Vampire CCG. Look forward to more playings.

RATING: 8
Love the theme, art design, mechanics, and strategic identity of the different factions. 

The release system strangled the development of the game, and it can be difficult to find cards today. Some of the factions are really only playable if you have a good amount of the final set. 

A worthy inheritor to L5R, but also a compelling game and setting in its own right. One of more successful "Arabian Nights" style games.

RATING: 7
A L5R spin-off that I vastly prefer to the original.  The water idea is excellent and makes for a great equalizer for power and costing.

RATING: 6.5
Great theme around a fun, challenging game.  I just wish the first edition rules were a little more clear.  I no longer own the cards because I decided to no longer play CCGs.  If you are a huge CCG fan, consider my rating an "8"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Generally solid game.  Impossible to find the final expansion set.  Heard rumors that WOTC destroyed all stock within 6 months of the final set being printed, bizarre.  The only problem with this game is the absolute horrid marketing and distribution.

Spin-off of L5R - the Scorpion clan leaves Rokugan for the land of the Senpet. 

Sold in "Rolling Thunder format" (see Doomtown and L5R post-DayofThunder) 

Gameplay evokes memories of V:tes. The game is geared to multi-player, but lacks the polical intrigue that sets Jyhad apart from the Multi-player pack as the undisputed king of multi-player CCGs. That being said LBS is a good game.

Cards have 2 costs - copper and water. Copper is generated from resources and your stronghold - direct rules port from L5R. Water is in short supply. Players have a finite amount to start (see Jyhad - Blood Pool) The struggle for water is key to gameplay and creates a strong tension.

Nice concept.  If they had ended L5R like they said they were going to, I probably would have been hooked on this one... as is L5R got my money for a while longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A substantial revision of the design basics of L5R makes this a clinically better game, and by that logic one of the best CCGs ever made in terms of gameplay interactions, depth & mechanics. All of the character-based drama, strategy and versatility without the snowballing and bottlenecks of its forefather. Have to blame the somewhat less appealing theme (Fantasy Samurais > Arabian Nights) and the rolling thunder disaster for the sinking of this one, which is a shame. 

Seriously, there's a reason this one is always an expensive one to find. It's one of the bests CCGs ever made.

My rating is based upon my years of experience playing a majority of the high profile, and highly regarded, ccgs.

Pretty fun game... I wish it had survived.  Could use one or two more mini-expansions to be really rounded out.  One complaint though... the card effects often have little bearing to the card title.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I have about 1000 cards, including 1 set of rules and 11 different strongholds (plus a few duplicates). Probably not enough cards for 11 functioning decks but certainly enough for your 6+ casual decks.

Will take a cash offer.

I'm such a sucker for the Arabian Nights theme. This is I believe one of the greatest CCG:s of all time. So many great and themed mechanims. Unfortunately and expectedly there are some broken cards and decks.  Sadly mistreated by WotC, it's life tragically ended way to early. Difficult to find nowadays, especially the last set (the Awakening).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of my favorite CCG's...which is sort of like saying "my favorite dental procedure."  Dripping with a theme that I consider vastly underused : fantasy Arabian.  Rules are a little slippery, but they come with time.

Not really interested in this one until the boxes make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk.  Looking to pay about 19 cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer 19 cents per in trade value if trading].  Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Prettier, more consistent, better thought-out, more interesting, and all-around cooler successor to Legend of the Five Rings.  Alas, the final set, which would really have kicked the game up an order of magnitude, is almost impossible to find.    I used to have a huge collection of this, got rid of it, and now I'm patiently reconstructing a collection.  Played again recently, and was pleased that it ran as smoothly as I remembered.  I've now tuned up the starters, and they make for a pretty great game.  You can still get resource-screwed, of course, so maybe a mulligan would be a good idea.

RATING: 7.5
Alderac learned from their mistakes with Five Rings and made a better game called Legend of the Burning Sands. It was a decent multi-player game, and an exciting two-player game. It is extremely disappointing that Alderac (and Wizards) failed to support this game, and even more disappointing that most of the cards from the big final set, The Awakening were destroyed instead of made available for sale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is/was my favorite CCG. I finally collected about 95% of the cards. We don&#039;t play it much anymore because I really have to get into the mood for the emotions this game often triggers in me (particularly against a dueling deck).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very interesting CCG with a arabian theme. It is similar to L5R and Deadlands, with improved gameplay mechanisms and a very nice background. Only drawback are the average pictures.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Feels different from L5R and, I must say, a bit more refined. Need to play more.

When it comes to collectible card games, such as Magic, or even a game like Dreamblade, I really appreciate a certain degree of bluntness. Legend of the Burning Sands, however, is not a blunt game. It's a bit more nuanced. There are multiple paths to victory, and there is more accounting. Burning Sands requires you to resolve various conflicts with too many numbers match-ups for my taste, and even though I really like the instant card resolution over the nested madness that Magic can sometimes become, I prefer Magic overall. Like I said, even though it is nuanced in some respects, the overall goal is blunt - straightforward: opponent has 20 life points. Reduce those to zero. Burning Sands is one of those games where I admire the design, but just have much more actual fun playing something else in a similar vein, such as Magic or Dreamblade. I also think Burning Sands requires too large of a card pool to forge it into a good game, a problem shared by Magic. I had high hopes, as I just love the Arabian theme, but oh well. Just a little bit too fiddly and time-consuming for what you get.

One of the best CCGs ever, IMO.  Alderac took everything "broken" out of the L5R design, tightened up some of the rules, made combat much more interesting (and intuitive), and the result is an excellent resource management-driven CCG.  I honestly can't see (unless you're put off by the theme) how anyone who enjoys CCGs could *not* like this.

Two player pick and pass game that is actually very well done.  Played over three rounds.  First round you have five cards.  Pick one, put it face down, pass the rest of the cards.  Both flip what you played then repeat until all 5 cards have been played.  Take however many madness you accumulated, calculate your score (five different suits of three cards each and three cards with no suit), pick up the played cards pick one to play, discard one, and get two new cards to bring your hand back up to five.  Repeat the pick and pass process and scoring but this time pick up all six cards, put two down to play, discard one card, and get two more cards to bring the hand back up to five.  Play the final round.  If at any time you have nine madness tokens you lose.  First time I played it we both thought it would be awfully hard to die from madness.  Three games and neither of us came close to losing from madness.  The second time we pulled the game out to play was completely different and each of the three games were won by someone going mad.  There is a decent depth to the game for both beginner board gamers and experienced.  If you need a filler type game I highly suggest this one.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: While purchasing this game, I was looking for a light filler with a duration of approximately 20 minutes. A game that would capture my son's attention but not outstay its welcome. Something with simple mechanisms in which we wouldn't need to refer to the rulebook often. I'm happy to say that this is that game. The artwork is fantastic, the theme is very Lovecraftian, and the game is simply a pleasure to play. This is a simple 2player drafting game with some delightfully convoluted score mechanisms, sprinkled in with an interesting "madness mechanism". The game forces your to walk a sanity tightrope whereby gaining the most madness rewards you but if you ever reach your threshold, you go insane and instantly lose the game. I'm not a fan of the scoring pad so will most likely concoct an alternate means of keeping score. I'm certain that my son will trounce me fairly often in the game as his memory is sharper than mine and I have a tendency to forget which cards I've passed over to him.

The sequel to tides of time adds the concept of madness tokens, and other than that is virtually the same game. The madness tokens however add an element you didn't realize the first one needed, push your luck. If you end the round with more madness than your opponent, you can take extra points or choose to get rid of a madness token instead. If you get too many madness tokens, you immediately go insane and lose the game. 

This takes the strategy and intrigue of the original tides of time up a notch and makes for an even more enjoyable experience for such a small game.

One day I will learn that microgames aren't for me. I play games for an emotional thrill and games this short don't really seem to provide one. For it's length and complexity, it offers enough interesting decisions (balancing what you need, what they need, and the risk of madness), I just don't get vested in the outcome. I suspect the point saladness of it, every card you draft will bring you points, also has me not caring much. I like consequences to my actions, when every decision I take brings me points, I don't feel quite as much connection between my choices and the outcome.

RATING: 6
A quick 2-player drafting game that works well. Unfortunately the theme does nothing for me and while the art may be great I totally ignored it in favor of simply looking at how to score points for each card. You play 3 rounds, drafting 5 cards each time. After each round you keep 1 card and discard 1 card so your tableau does get bigger each round. It's a quick 2p game but there are other games I would rather play with just two.

RATING: 7
A drafting game for two players, which is rare.  The madness sets this one up just slightly from Tides of Time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not as good as its predecessor. Maybe because Tides of Time was played to death and the game is too similar to it. Or maybe because the theme does not make that much sense. Playing investigators that alternately investigate places and ancient beings, I find this confusing. Why didn't they put either 18 Lovecraft monsters or 18 typical Lovecraft settings into the game? I for my part would have loved to "investigate" 18 unique settings instead of monsters. I find the artwork on cards like "Innsmouth" very well-made, and it would have created a more subtle horror to not see the monsters of the suggested world. This would have also been in Lovecraft's sense.

I love this game!  Strictly for 2 players, this game can be played in a short amount of time, and taught fairly easily.  The card drafting mechanic is well done with the complex mix of card suits, point conditions, as well as the threat of gaining madness with certain cards.  The artwork is absolutely beautiful, and the theme fits very well.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quick, simple-yet-complex 2 player game.

Really nice artwork, but I doubt it will come to the table much. In several games, we double-disqualified due to madness (yup, we quickly lost track of our oncoming insanity). For a filler, I would prefer something like Love Letter that can accommodate more players.

The nice thing, at the given price point, it doesn't take much to get your "value" out of the game.

RATING: 7.5
A 2 player drafting micro game which plays in 15 minutes. Tides of Madness effectively replaces Tides of Time. The new mechanic is ‘madness’ which some cards come with - collect too many of these and you lose instantly. It works really well and adds a new dimension to the game without adding any complexity. Everything else is pretty much the same. 

There really isn’t any need to own or play Tides of Time now that Tides of Madness exists. 

The only downside is that it has Cthulu theming. I personally have a thing about lazy theming whereby Cthulu is simply layered on top of a decent game. Some people must love Cthulu as it seems to infect so many games. There is an almost infinite world of themes to explore in gaming, please stop using this one which so many people don’t care about. It actually puts me off a game if it has a Cthulu theme.

RATING: 6
Tide of Madness is a 2-player micro drafting game. This is a sequel of sorts to Tides of Time, but now with madness and Cthulhu! The game includes only 18 cards, but has some interesting decisions to be made. You're mainly trying to collect sets. The cards are usually in a coloured suit and has a unique scoring mechanism. Some cards also have a symbol indicating that you will take a madness during scoring. If you gained the most madness during the round, you can either gain points or lose one of your madness tokens. Subsequently, if you take too much madness, you instantly lose the game. So, you have to weigh a lot of information on deciding what scoring/suits you want, deducing what your opponent wants, pushing your luck with madness, trying to push your opponent to madness overload, and  remembering the cards you passed.

Like Tides of Time, after the first two scoring rounds you have a choice to make with your tableau: which card will you keep going into the next round, and which will you remove from the game? 

While I think madness adds more to think about (a good thing imo) and I generally like the Cthulhu Mythos in games, some of the monster portraits aren't as good as I've seen in other games. Overall, this is good 2-player filler. However, I can't say if it's better than Tides of Time because I haven't played that one. I'd imagine the tension of madness makes this the better version to own.

Super simple to learn and play set collection game. The complexity, comes from deducing which cards your opponent is likely to play. Often the choices may seem a bit obvious though, "most points for me, least points for them." Or some permutation of that thought. The art on the cards is beautiful, the game is really cheap and fun for two. I can see it getting stale over extended plays, but 2-3 quick filler games for when you have a spare 30 mins is doable.

I already loved Tides of time and this adds a push-your-luck element. The madness tokens raise the stakes and create extra pressures in several situations. At the right moment it can be used to force the opponent to lose.

With the changes to the card skills the victories seem to be tighter than in Tides of Time.

Adds more components and rules, diluting the elegance of the original game a bit.

Pretty light, but a head to head draft gives this a unique space that Sushi Go doesn't quite fill. I think there's probably room for more thinking in our plays but that would just push the game longer than it warrants.

Despite being light the game always feels a bit 'busy'. Lots of things are happening but they're all a bit too easy to figure out. Game is always very close and so there's a bit of a superficial feeling with your decisions.

I don't think this'll show up often, Sushi Go is more fun for drafting, and Hive/7WD are better for head to head.

Nice design--like the oversized cards. It feels like there aren't enough cards, though. You go through all of them in a single game, so there are no surprises what you are going to see and this kills replayability for me. There's little variance between games and subsequent games aren't very exciting with a small pool of cards to work with.

Essentially the same game as Tides of Time.  Super short and fun.  The madness mechanic adds some tension to the game, but for these micro-games, I'm not sure tension is what we are looking for.  I'm rating it just slightly lower than its predecessor.  Both lovely and fun games.

Brilliant two player game. It's hard to understand how a game that consists of only very little amount of cards and a few tokens, can be so damn good. Every decision in this game counts.

Tides of Madness is a clever drafting game that doesn't overstay it's time of enjoyment.

3 rounds, 2 players, 1 card per pass thru a 5 card hand.

Opportunities for scoring, and for messing w your opponent abound, but it never will take long to finish.

Cthulhu theme adds to the play value, as does the risk/reward for collecting Cult knowledge/madness.

A good quick 2 player- but I don't think my wife will care for the mythos.

Even so, this seems the version to have.

A lean game of card drafting and multi-card combo-ing. Works well in challenging each player to balance optimising card selection between cards which benefit them and cards which will frustrate the other player's points accumulation. Glorious artwork.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2017)

I never liked very much Tides of Time, I recognize it is a clever game, but it is too simple for my current tastes. I bought it, played and sold it so I don’t understand why I bought Tides of Madness (I think I need help in this regard, on 2018 I will try to solve this issue). From the very start, I knew the game wasn’t for me. It is VERY similar to Tides of Time.

The rules are uber simple. You can explain them under 1 minute. Playtime is around 20 minutes.

I love the theme, but you don’t feel it much through the game. The art continues to be amazingly good (its best feature). The components are also good.

The rulebook is too dark so I couldn’t read the examples easily, not that you need to do so as the game is very simple. In any case the rulebook looks great, but it isn’t very functional.

Times of Madness have, somewhat, interesting decisions and I have fun while I play it, but after it ends, I have no desire to ever play it again. I like that it is a drafting game for two, so memory plays a huge role here. The game is very similar to Tides of Time, the main difference is that now you can acquire “Madness Tokens” and if you have enough tokens, you automatically lose the game.

The replayability factor seems to be low, too few cards.

Bottom line, Tides of Madness is a solid game, but not for me. It features great art but boring gameplay. It is very simple for our current tastes, it is also a bit better than Tides of Time. I already sold it. It would have been nice if both sets of games could be combined.

A little too much madness . . . lost two games in a row by going mad.  I think if your opponent tries to stick it to you with madness (and they get the right draw) there is little you can do to avoid it. Don't get me wrong it's a clever little game, but I think it is being over-hyped. Also while beautiful the cards contain 90% non functional art and thus, the iconography is small and hard to read upside down on your opponents' cards. Also they left out the mini card to use as markers for your retained cards that were included in Tides of Time. Scratches a similar itch to Sushi Go (both are fast playing drafting games) but I think I prefer SG over this slightly.

RATING: 7
A Cthulhu themed evolution of Tide of Time. I enjoy the extra layer of madness introduced in this version. This is a 2 player hand drafting game designed. The reason this game is great is each card provides a scoring condition/requirement and generally one of 5 suits in the game. 
The interesting part is that none of the suits on the cards contribute their own scoring condition. Meaning once you done the initial "take one card and pass", now both players have perfect information of the current hands in play.

Too dry for me.  Played part way through one game with the wife and she gave up after the first round.  There was too much information on the cards for her to wrap her head around what the advantage of one card over another was.  I wasn't enjoying the experience either.  I understood which cards I should be trying to get but it didn't appeal to me.

Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.

Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.

One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.

Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.

I was lukewarm on my first play, largely due to the card design, but quite liked this on my second. Seeing it all in action once made a big difference.

The core gameplay is excellent. I like knowing that the whole deck will eventually get used, and how it gets tweaked by refreshes; I love the balancing act of managing madness vs. blocking my opponent vs. scoring points vs. gambling on things going my way. It's an enjoyable tightrope act.

The cards, while pretty, are kind of annoying from a usability standpoint. The most important part, the rules text, is small and not terribly readable (downright illegible from across the table), and the suit icons, while fine at full size, are much too small in the text. The cards themselves being gigantic is kind of a neutral point, although ironic given how uselessly small the important bits are.

They did away with that stupid overpowered card which "breaks all ties", thank God. By my estimation, that had to be the sole reason to make a new version of TOT, just to get rid of it. They replaced it was a Wild Card, which is much better. While i'm not a Cthulhu fanboy, i quite enjoyed the madness mechanic in this version. It adds a little complexity, for better or worse, it does put a little more meat on its bones for the gamers. Artwork is of course excellent, however i do find some of the graphic creatures to be off-putting to me personally, so that's something to consider.

Adds an extra layer of depth to an already great game. Now someone can lose outright if they end up with too much madness before the end of the game. I do wonder why they felt the need to release this so soon after Tides of Time though. Honestly, if you have Tides of Time already, you don't really need this. If you have neither, however, this is definitely the one to pick up.

RATING: 7
Quick, good filler card game where players draft cards to achieve set bonuses while trying to avoid picking up madness tokens. Too many madness tokens can cause a player to lose even if they are ahead on points. The madness tokens are a great addition and add an extra level to the game. Easy to learn and play with new players.

RATING: 7
The best of the microgames I have played, purring along smoothly in only ten minutes or so, and throwing out some really interesting decisions.  Elements of bluff and doublethink are to the fore in the three rounds as you strive to build up your tableau without going mad.  Some exquisite moments in our games have shown me that a bluffing game can work just as well when both players know the other person's hand.  Impressive stuff and a likely keeper.

A good two-player experience.  The drafting mechanic helps the competitive nature of the game.  Although a couple of the cards offer some interesting strategic options, you are essentially going for identical combinations across most of the card types (Examples: whoever has the most of X gets Y amount of points, or, for every X that you have, gain Y points). The theme is not entirely immersive, but I like that the madness tokens add the element of threat management.

[b]Tides of Madness[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Right off the top I think Tides of Madness is better than Tides of Time just for the share fact that it adds another mechanic to the game, madness tokens, which can trigger an instant loss. This opens up the game a bit more as you try and figure out how much you can push your luck because the cards that cause you to take madness tokens are quite powerful. Also, while I'm not a Cthulhu fan, I prefer the art in this version as well. 

I think you could get a good number of plays out of this before it starts to feel samey so I may pick up a copy because it is a great 10 minute filler that sets up in seconds. [/i]

I thought Tides of Time was an ok game, but I found it to be lacking something.  The madness mechanism in Tides of Madness provides that extra layer that Tides of Time was missing.  You cannot simply sit back and max points now as you can easily lose by accumulating too many madness tokens.  It is still not quite as good as some other 2 player card game classics such as Lost Cities or Battle Line, but it is close.  I would easily choose Tides of Madness over Jaipur, and I do like Jaipur.

This rendition of Tides of Time adds a madness mechanic that adds a lot of tension to the game.  Balancing risk of insta-death with point totals makes the game more than just straight math -- there is some risk-vs-reward calculation, not just computing the best play and doing it.  It also creates some unpredictability, even in a nearly-perfect information 2 player game.

Manages to be more than a mere retread of the original thanks to its clever madness mechanism.

Tides of Madness is largely the same game as Tides of Time, with a new theme and a few tweaks. A couple of the cards have been changed, and a new mechanic of madness has been added. Some cards increase your madness, making them less attractive. Get too much madness and you lose outright.

The changes don't completely change the game, but they make it different enough for it to be worth playing even if you already have ToT.

Great art.  Simple game play.  Doesn't seem to have much depth.  Good filler though.

Hate-drafting: the card game. Fun, but not enough depth for long term appeal.

I shouldn't have paid full price for this game. I enjoy neither the gameplay nor the theme enough. : /

Played Tides of Madness with E and enjoyed it. Positive surprise.

Not as good as Tides of Time but still solid. The madness mechanic adds something to think about. Though I believe its something that was necessarily needed. I enjoy both games and would not turn down the opportunity to play either. I just prefer Time more.

Beautiful. It plays fast, and lets you either go full euro and just get the best points, or go full aggro and kill the other player with your brain. I love love love Lovecraft, and this one is honestly the most lore-correct game ever made in his mythos - you aren't saving the world, you're just researchers, trying to learn more about the haunting things man was not meant to know... and if you venture far, you are lost. That's every Lovecraft plot in a nutshell. But you can equally just play this as a simple gateway game with someone who knows nothing about games or Cthulhu, because it's so simple. How cool is that?

fun two player drafting game.  I like the madness spin of the game and its something you really need to watch out for since its really easy to get A LOT of madness throughout the game.  I like that the game is so simple and it really makes you think about which cards to add to your tableau

I like it!  A quick filler with some additional additional thinking due to the "madness" factor.

The slightly-weird brother to Tides of Time. Some graphics are comparably awesome, others not so much, but that is beside the point. The addition of madness makes for an interesting rule change and adds another dimension of strategy, but in the end I prefer the vanilla version, as this one too often boils down to "I'd like to get points, but I can't because I'll go mad".

Now that I've played this version, Tides of Time has been lowered just a bit. I really like the addition of the madness tokens.

RATING: 5
It's clever, and I'm probably missing something, but I just feel that there are aren't enough cards to be able to do what you want to do in order to make the game feel satisfying.

Strategically deepened Tides of Time. I do miss "Win all ties" (not so much other no suit cards), am completely ignorant of Lovecraftian overrated doodling and even like ToT artwork better, but yes - this small addition is a worthy one when it comes to strategizing.

Tides of Madness is a sequel to Tides of Time and features gameplay similar to that design, only with a slight Cthulhu themed skin (because I love all things Cthulhu). Tides of Time is a drafting game for two players.

Ein simples Kartenspiel, schnell erklärt, aber mit einer spannenden Kartentausch-Mechanik. Schön für zwischendurch. Warum das nun ausgerechnet schon wieder Lovecraft sein muss, weiß ich allerdings nicht...

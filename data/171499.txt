I was taught this at DGM, and came away pleasantly surprised. I was shocked that it is a 2015 game. It has a classic feel to it (I guess if early to mid-2000s is "classic"). It is fairly simple to learn, plays fast, and has a good amount of depth to it. And it's cheap. Very nice. I could see my rating going up with more plays.

LIKE: Clever system of worker placement with tiles. Simple rules, quick to pick up and play.
DISLIKE: I feel the value 4 market tile is quite desirable, leading to predictable moves. Some randomness in the tile draw will block people out from desirable tiles.

OVERALL: Interesting game, I'll have to play again to see how much longevity there really is.

RATING: 6
A nice little game. Very tactical with only a faint hint of long term planning. You could wish for a stronger strategy element but the game plays in 45 minutes and gives you the satisfactory feeling of accomplishing something at least. Cacao involves a fair amount of blocking your opponents, building your own position on the board and seizing the opportunities while trying not to leave yourself vulnerable to hostile exploitation. Suffers from analysis paralysis towards the end, though, when your options have increased by two orders of magnitude.
 
Could certainly play Cacao again.

Now this is a fun game! It's very light, but very enjoyable, and there's plenty of decision-making during the course of the game. I prefer Carcassonne and Isle of Skye to it as tile-laying games, but it's worth a look nonetheless.

RATING: 7
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Cacao provides an interesting take on the tile laying genre, tweaking it just enough to become unique while still being familiar for all the fans of Carcassonne. In fact this game could easily be part of that line as one of its brother's variations.

First of all... Artwork and components, while being pretty standard for this type of games, are for sure one of the strengths of the product. Everything is very colorful, bright and definitively eye-catchy. Yet, for the very nature of its theme though, the landscape you build during each game is not going to vary very much and that was one of the things I enjoyed the most in Carcassonne: look at what we build at the end of the game. That's unfortunately gone here. Speaking of game-play instead, Cacao has all the characteristics of a solid family game, although there might be too many small concepts and tiny mechanisms to make it as successful as its brother with that kind of crowd. The game offers indeed quite a few scoring possibilities and the player definitively has to pay attention to all of them to gather more victory points than the others at the table. 

While I recognize the value of this game though, it's not a game I love, even if I like it. The main reason being that, given the presence of so many little scoring systems, Cacao might feel a little "point-salady" and I'm not a big fan of this sort of games, because they make me lose the sense of purpose that usually other game provide. 

Still... the game offers interesting choices, there's a good euro-style player interaction and it's pretty fast and light. All in all Cacao is a good game that, even if it doesn't shine, does everything right to entertain and probably goes over really well with new to next step gamers.

RATING: 6
1st play: Pleasant tile laying game, much shorter than Carcasonne but about the same level of complexity.  More tactical than strategic, and not as much opportunity for screwage make this a good introductory game.  The insert is excellent and the bits are great as well.  

2nd play: Still a good smooth easy filler level game that has great production values and a unique theme.  I'm not sure how much depth there is here, but the gameplay has a good tactical element, and it's easy to explain in under 5 minutes.

A clever, quick and simple tile-laying game that includes elements of worker placement into the tiles themselves.  Tiles are placed, a'la Carcassonne to maximise scoring for Cacao beans, water sources, trade, mines, sun tokens and to gain majority over temples.  Plenty of strategy, multiple scoring paths and quick turns make this a fun, accessible and friendly game for families and non-gamers alike with short play time and plenty of replayability.

Good game but does lack replayability after a few games. Rules are very simple and game can easily be scaled based upon number of players (as stated in rules).

Much better game when played with extra modules (from expansions Chocolatl and Diamante) as this does extend the replayability.

Like Carcassone: draw a tile, lay a tile, although some luck mitigation in that you have several tiles to choose from (rather than Carcassone's single blind draw). I find Carcassone more pleasant and easy-going. Cacao, while similar in rules complexity, has a bit more strategic depth and space for decisions...but somehow just isn't as appealing.

RATING: 8
In this tile laying game you are building up a jungle/cacao plantation in a style similar to Carcassonne. In it however you are gathering money and/or  cacao beans or building up temples to score points. Each tile the players have allot different numbers of workers to each location they join with their tile. Thus you may have 2 workers on one side that gives you 2 cacao beans and also 1 worker that might give you money. The key in placing your tiles in such a way that it benefits you while giving your opponents nothing or perhaps blocking them out of something completely. This game has flown completely under the radar but is fun, good to look at, has a short play time (25-35 minutes we have found) and has some good strategy and tactics.

Interesting, light Euro style game where you're placing tiles as your workers, adjacent to jungle tiles that you then activate to give you cacao fruits or other resources that will help you score at the end of the game. However, be warned that the jungle tiles will also reward other players who are adjacent to them. Almost like it's a tile laying worker placement. Colorful, easy to pick up, and I like the tactile feel of the water carriers on the individual player boards. Fairly tight, simple design but not without a little depth.

Cacao is a tile-laying game with a similar feel and complexity as Carcassonne. And while I suspect many gamers are going to find Cacao to be unoriginal... it seems more refined/interesting than Carcassonne. For one, the larger hand size of 3 makes the game feel less luck dependent. But because of the known-distribution of tiles, players can actually plan several turns ahead. And the decisions aren't solitaire... players may intentionally place a tile to cut off another player and/or place it with the plan to build-over it later (with a sun token). 

Considering the short-game time and ease of explaining the rules, Cacao is a wonderful filler. And the component quality (including the insert) were thoughtfully designed. 

My only complaint is that the game would benefit from player-aids highlighting the distribution of tiles with x-players. That way, players aren't passing around the rulebook, which is on the thin/flimsy side. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A nice, easy to learn game. It's a bit too light for the amount of time it takes, and a bit mathy at the end, but still a nice experience.

The theme is unfortunately just "not there". It's an interesting theme, but it's just a paste-on.

Nem akartam elsőre 8-ast adni, mert az nálam ebben a könnyedebb kategóriában a tökéletest jelenti kb. De mindenképp kategóriája egyik legjobbja ez a játék. Megvan a Carcassonne utánérzés, de látszik a 15 év különbség. Hasonlóan letisztult, kicsit mélyebb, de még ez is a családi határán van, és szerintem kevésbé konfrontatív, mint a Carca. Szerintem még akár a top100-ban is helyet érdemelne, már ha ez jelent bármit is. 3 főnél hátránynak éreztem a kezdést a napimádó korong használata szempontjából, mert még nem fogytak el a lapkák, amikor én voltam soron, de amúgy mindig jó és jobb közül lehet választani, szóval ez nem gond. Egyébként 3 fővel 3x10 kör van, ami nekünk 30 perc alatt lement, szóval nagyon gyors!

Cacao is a fast and clever tile-placement game, full of little interesting decisions.

There are two types of tiles: worker and jungle. They will be placed in a checkerboard pattern during the game.
Each player has a(n identical) stack of worker tiles, has a hand of three of them. During is turn he will play one of these worker tiles, then fill the eventual gaps with jungle tile(s), and then activate jungle tiles to receive bounties for each worker on a side corresponding with a jungle tile. This will grant cacao, water or points.

Everything is so simple, straightforward and elegant: light years from nowadays über complex euros, but not less compelling to play.

Nice job, mr. Walker-Harding.

Leuk familiespel dat evenwichtig in elkaar steekt, en niet te lang duurt.

Je legt je worker tiles naast jungle tiles.
Een deel is dus bekend op voorhand, maar een ander deel niet.  Want sommige jungle tiles leg je pas aan NA je worker.

Vergeet de tempels niet, want daarmee kan je op het einde nog best veel punten scoren.

Verder: cacao bonen oogsten, ze verkopen op de markt, goud delven of water scoren (noodzakelijk!)

Bought based on great reviews, and like the game very much. A very polished tile-laying game, with several scoring variations - some tiles net you points on a linear progression, some do the bell-curve, some pay out only upon second action. All is nicely varied, with a very simple ruleset. A great family game, with enough simplicity for the casual gamers, and just enough complexity for the players who enjoy some mild number crunching.

I found this one to be a bit bland.  While there are a good amount of choices, those choices got "samey" even after only a few plays.  I am typically not really into tile placement games, but with all of the hype around this one I was interested to give it a try.  It for sure did not live up to the hype for me.

Játék:
Ez egy végtelenül egyszerű játék, de mégis valahogy játszanék vele, ha a társaság úgy gondolja. Talán egy kicsit kevésnek tartom a lapokat hozzá, de az is igaz, hogy a lerakási  mechanizmusa nem enged többet, mert olyan öngerjesztően hosszú lenne a játék. Ennyi lappal is el kell dőlnie, hogy kinyer. Szóval összességében nem rossz
Kicsomagolás és alkatrészek:
A doboz szabványos Carsassonne méretű kifogástalan AS minőség. A grafika szerintem förtelmes, mely alapján biztos nem vettem volna meg.
Kibontás után legfelül a szabálykönyv, majd alatta tíz darab kinyomókarton és alatta a tároló rekesz. Érdekes módon oldották meg, mert a kinyomó kartonokat is magába foglalja a tároló rekesz, így nem igazán tudom, hogy nem fog összeborulni, ha nem fektetve tárolom a dobozt. A kartok a szokásos jó minőséggel készültek el.
A tároló rekeszben található valami plusz ajándék és a fa alkatrészek. Nincs hozzá extra nejlon, mert mindent a rekeszekbe tervezte tárolni a kiadó.
De jól megoldották. Mindennek megvan a helye, sőt az esetleges promo lapoknak is maradt hely a dobozban. Annyi a titok, hogy semmiképpen sem szabad kidobni a kinyomó kartonokat, azokat is vissza kell tenni üresen. Annyi okosság még lehetett volna, hogy a szabálykönyvet pont a kinyomó kartonok méretével nyomtatják, így azt alájuk téve teljesen lefedte volna alkatrészeket az elmozdulás ellen. Így én oda hajtogattam a szabályfordítás.

Nice family tile laying game. Some clever fresh ideas that bring an interesting twist : tiles come from the hand and from a choice on the table (jungle tiles), sun worship tiles can be important in the end..

RATING: 6
A neat, cute little tile laying game.  You must balance all the ways of scoring points to score as efficiently as possible, as everyone has the exact same amount of influence in the game, so the most efficient use of that influence will win!

Overall, a good family level game with simple, clever mechanisms that hold enough interest for a gamer as well.

Scores are always really close, even between experienced players and newbies. This makes it a good gateway game, because new players won't get blown out of the water. On the other hand, I'm not sure there's as much depth as there seems to be.

One of the few games I feel should be in "every" collection. As many have eluded to already it is a pretty straight forward tile layer game that implements worker placement in a very unique way. While it doesn't strategically rise to the level of Isle of Skye; it is deeper and more strategic then is given credit for. I've only played two player (four times) and the games are always close and exciting. If you like Cacao then you need to check out Walker's other little tile-layering gem BarenPark (which undoubtedly will draw comparisons to Patchwork/Cottage Garden), again proving he can create a great game that is fun and exciting for all age groups.

A very simple and quick game.  I like it as it is fairly easy to teach and a fairly easy to grasp tile laying game.  My parents enjoyed it too!

Aug 2016- down to a 6.  The tactics is a bit too predictable and depends on which neutral tiles come out.  A bit too luck based if everyone in the group plays well.

Enjoyable tile laying game, simple and intuitive rules with lots of little things to think about as you play since you can benefit your opponents with where you lay the jungle tiles. I look forward to trying this out with my wife to see what she thinks of it. I do wish the jungle tiles were a bit more variable each game, but with the 2 promos already out and modular expansion coming I think that may add the variability to keep this game fresh from play to play.

Clever tile-laying game, where your try to combine as many benefits per action as possible. There is quite a bit of luck involved, due to the double drawing of tiles. It is also quite possible that some strategies are dominating. Still, for what it is, a nice diversion. Future expansions have the potential of increasing the appeal of this game. As is, I do not see myself seeking another play of it, but will play it if it hits the table.

Inoffensive and simple Carcassonne clone with much more restrictive placement rules. There's a bit of Conquistador/El Caballero lurking in this game, but then without the kicking-each-other-out rules of that game. Might be fun with somewhat elder children, but I'm afraid it's far more cost effective to go straight to the more involved games and adapt the rules until they can handle them in full. No intent of playing again.

At first glance on Yucata, this game looked derivative and I wasn't very excited about it. The rules were simple to pick up, though - so I gave it a whirl.

I was impressed that this actually stands firmly on its own as a new twist on the tile-laying genre. You have to figure out what's best for you but also keep in mind what benefits you may be giving your opponents. And the use of sun tiles to "redo" areas of the display is very clever.

This would make a great gateway game for those new to the hobby. I've liked this enough that I intend to get my own copy soon.

Non, le chocolat ne pousse pas dans les arbres. Il est issu d'une graine qui s’appelle la fève de cacao. Et il peut être récolté par des meeples ! C'est ce que vous propose ce jeu de pose de tuiles.

Oui, parce que le chocolat, c'est bon, mais l'or c'est mieux. Et je ne vous parle pas des pièces d'or en chocolat ! Un bon petit jeu pas plus compliqué et de la même famille que Carcassonne.

Ranked after 6 plays - 1 @ 3 / 5 @ 2

Quick tile laying game that has a bit of luck, a bit of player interaction and not a whole lot of take-that. Winning seems to require matching the other players on the water track and keeping the Cacao engine producing/selling. A few games have been lost by 1 or 2 gold, basically a random ordering of the tiles and player order. A nice filler for nights where we don't have time to pull out a huge game. Probably doesn't have long term staying power unless there are a string of expansions.

Players try to amass the most amount of gold, by working on cacao plantations, selling the fruit, working in gold mines, and so on.  Game play sort of resembles Carcassonne, in that it is a tile placement game, but here the workers are printed on a set of player tiles.  Very nice filler, attractively produced, and very easy to explain and play.  Nicely done.

Yeah it's light. But it's aiming to be. Preferable to me to carcassonne as the cocoa beans (I think that is what they are) act as a currency with variable value - I also prefer the overall aesthetic. Game is easy to teach, plays well with two, has an accurate play time of around 45 minutes. The game is fine as it is, I am hoping the expansion will eek it up a little bit with some additional complexity. Happy to play this anytime.

Addendum: though this game is good, it's not particularly exciting. I am coming to the conclusion that I don't like tile placement full stop.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Aunque la sencillez y la ligereza pueden resultar agradables en un juego, Cacao lleva estos conceptos al extremo: al terminar la partida, te das cuenta de que no guardas ninguna sensación sobre la misma (ni buena ni mala) y que no tardarás en olvidarla por completo.

No sé si es por su azar (dependes absolutamente del orden en el que vayan apareciendo las losetas de selva) o su escasa interacción, pero creo que la palabra que mejor describe a este juego es "intrascendente", y eso no puede ser bueno (ni siquiera para un filler). 

En resumen: es muy difícil odiarlo, pero por el mismo motivo es casi seguro que se quedará cogiendo polvo en la estantería (por muy modesta que sea una colección, seguro que siempre habrá juegos mejores a los que echar una partida, lo que relegará el Cacao al olvido). Incluso si superas esta falta de emoción y te obligas a jugarlo más veces, te encuentras con que es uno de esos juegos que se queman rápido, y a las pocas partidas puedes acabar cansado de él.

Aunque tampoco se puede decir que sea "horrible", si se busca un juego de colocación de losetas es mucho mejor decantarse por un clásico como el Carcassonne.

A very pleasant and immediate tile-laying game that could fit well in the light family game category.   That's a crowded category in my collection, so I don't know if I would add this, but I certainly would like to play it a few times more.   The checkerboard mechanism is the heart of the game.   The theme makes little to no sense, but that's not necessarily a problem in this case.  Long-term shelf life could be in doubt.

Lakpkalerakós játék, ami megfér a Carcassonne mellett, főleg, mert a lapkalerakás és a játékmenet különbözőségének köszönhetően teljesen más élményt nyújt. A lapkalerakás és a munkás lehelyezés egyvelege, ami egyszerű szabályainak köszönhetően családi játéknak kifejezetten alkalmas. Győzelmi pontot, ami itt arany formájában manifesztálódik, többféleképpen szerezhető, kakaóbabok begyűjtésével és piacon történő értékesítésével, templomok körüli többségi versennyel, aranybányászattal vagy vízhordó jómunkásember előremozdításával. A napkorongok használatával könnyen borsot törhetünk az ellenfelek orra alá vagy újabb érmékkel gazdagíthatjuk a törzsi kincstárat. Még gondolkodósabb családban is lemegy 1 órán belül egy menet, gyakorlottabbaknak egy gyors játék lehet. A családtagoknak a Carcassonne: Déltengert juttatta eszébe, valószínűleg a piacozás miatt. Ajánlott családi játék. (2017.12.27.)

Fairly simple tile laying game. There's a bit of a competitive rush once players know the truly valuable tiles, both in the shared deck and personal decks. The endgame sneaks up quickly as the game does not overstay its welcome. The expansion adds a bit of variety to player strategies but may be a bit confusing for new players.

A good-spirited, bright-colored filler that feels nice and not violent at all (for a change hehe). The obvious reference is Carcassonne of course, but after a bunch of plays (all two players) it feels a bit same-y. I would like to play it with three or four people to see the jungle unfold quicker and so the spots are harder to grab since there are more players that want to get to them. Nice game.

This is a good game, but I don't know if there's enough strategic depth with the base game to keep me interested in it. It does get a bit puzzle-perfect A/P near the end to (in order to maximise the score) and there isn't the tension as the tiles run out as one might expect.  I don't like the coins; the Carcasonne score track is preferred.  i prefer Carcasonne with expansions 1,2, etc., but will look at Phillip Walker-Harding's next games and this one is still a lot of fun which I definitely want to play again and the expansion is highly regarded, so after playing that, my rating will be revised.

[b]Rating based on - 25+ plays, 2 player-3player[/b]
A tactical tile placement and area control game with a worker placement element where you manage a hand of 3 tiles, place them effectively to generate cacao, sell it at the market, collect water, and fight for area control of various jungle temples. The game has simple and clear rules, is easy to learn and play, comes in an appropriate (Carcassonne sized) box for both the included content and the expansions, with a most beautiful and functional insert that is right up there with the one from Tobago. 

When I first heard about it didn't really grab me which is rare for me since tile placement is my favourite mechanism. It just didn't sound very exciting. Then there was a lot of hype about it post-Essen and I thought I was missing out so I wanted to at least try it. I was happily surprised to find it on Yucata.de so I got quite a few plays in. It didn't do anything for me personally. It was just OK. It felt very similar from play to play and also felt very Carcassonne-y...quite ho-hum. However, I was lucky enough to get it as a package +Chocolatl +Volcanoes and I wanted to try it a) in person with my gaming partner, and b) with the expansions to see if that elevates the gameplay any. It played fine, just as I remember from Yucata...still really didn't do much for me personally, but I'm not against playing it. It passes the time nicely, is quick to play and is quite relaxing, but it's a bit too simple for us even though we love simple games. A couple of negatives – it's easy to see and calculate whether you are winning or losing which makes the end game kind of anti-climactic, also the last player has a significant advantage when placing their tile so the game slows down on the last couple of turns as everybody is trying to maximise their end game position.

Would recommend for those looking for a nice light introduction to tile placement or weighing up economic choices (kids or non-gamers), and also those who like Carcassonne and want something in a similar vein as a bit of a rest from it. Having more advanced games in my collection, and being as I am quite spoilt for choice in the Tile Placement category, I can't think of a time I would choose to play this over any of our firm favourites.

Lighter than I was expecting and greatly overshadowed by Carcassonne.  In addition I found the design of the game too safe and balanced.  I also feel the game could have benefited from greater variation of the art on the tiles.

Cacao has some nice cheerful artwork and a neat purpose designed inlay and plays great at all player counts. There is a nice level of player interaction without any of the outright meanness of Carcassonne for instance. Thinking of that venerable tile-layer there is definitely an old school feel about Cacao but it is still very much its own game. Simple and quick playing Cacao is a satisfyingly sweet snack, much like a favourite chocolate bar.

Love at first play. I knew I would like this light tile-placement game with that subdued but intricate German-style artwork I'm so fond of. File alongside of Carcassonne and Maori. Games with such perfectly minimal and smooth gameplay don't come along as often as you'd think they would. It's harder to make something work with less than it is with more.

Very good tile-laying exploration game that plays really well with two players. Also, it's fast! We never play just one game.

It's easy to compare this to Carcassonne. I like this one a lot more! Instead of making "bets" with your meeples, you use them right away and can chain actions in the moment. Another big plus is not having the confusing farmer rules. Win/Win.

Good production values and functional insert too.

Carcassonne light édesség
A 2015-ös év végi nagy leárazások során „ínycsiklandó” áron jutottam hozzá a játékhoz, amelyet előtte már online kipróbáltam és elnyerte tetszésemet.
Nem lehet nem megemlíteni a Carcassonne „Nagy Öreghez” hasonló lapkalehelyező mechanizmusát. Kezdő törzsfőnökként te szeretnél a Kaka(ók) Földjének legnagyobb kakasa lenni, amely cél érdekében öntözöl, termelsz, piacolsz, templomba jársz és aranybányában dolgozol, miközben versenytársaiddal együtt alakítod a dzsungelt, a játékteret.
Körödben 3 a kezedben lévő munkáslapkából választva törekedsz minél több pontot megszerezni, vagy fontosabb területeket befoglalni (ennek fontos szerepe lesz a játék végén, amikor lehetőséged lehet 1-3 lapkád felülépítésére). Igazán mindenki magának épít, konfrontáció nem létezik a játékban, egyszerűen élvezheted, ahogy a Birodalmad az eltervezettek szerint alakul (vagy nem). A kezdőjátékos tapasztalataim szerint az esetek többségében hátrányban van.
A szabályok könnyűek, a játék nyelvfüggetlen, magyar nyelvű szabálya létezik (sőt már kiadása is), valamint az egyik legjobb belső elrendezéssel bír, öröm ki-és visszapakolni. Ezt más játékok tervezői, kivitelezői is eltanulhatnák.

Es uno de esos juegos que esta a medio camino entre Eurogame y Filler. Cuatro reglas sencillas, unos tableros, unos cuantos meeples y marcadores y hala, a hacer puntos. 

Este es un poquito de posicionamiento de trabajadores, un poquito carcassone y a pesar de la mezcolanza no desentona. es ameno, bastante rapido, ligero y tiene su aquel estrategico. 

Es un juego ligerito de esos que le encantan a dani para complementar a uno mucho mas sesudo. 

En lineas generales, un buen juego.

Although there is the randomness of the tiles that are out when it is your turn to place them, the game is quick and flow smoothly with just the right amount of player interaction.  The art is fantastic as always when Claus Stephan is involved.  Just a note.  Save the punched out boards when you are done popping out the tiles.  These will need to be place on top of everything in the trays or the pieces go everywhere is you turn the game sideways.

Play 2P once at 2016 Taipei International Book Exhibition, so only initial rating.

Every company wants its own Carcassonne. But, I just don't get the idea, it seems that Cacao is just a very plain get-n-spend game(where Carcassonne has some long term planning on placing meeples). I've played once, so I may be wrong.

The good thing is that it's faster, cleaner & simpler than what I've heard.

Solid tile laying filler that has enough going on to keep my interest. I did play it at 2, and I can see it suffering a bit with more players where you'd have less of an ability to plan and strategize. In fact at 4 it would be possible for you to never have access to certain tiles if you got unlucky, which I can see being frustrating. But that said I'm rating for what I've actually experienced which was a solid 2p experience.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2016)

I bought the game blind, as usual, so I wasn’t expecting anything, good or bad, from it. A friend liked Cacao but compared it to Carcassonne, so I almost sold the game right there (I really dislike Carcassonne) however it goes against my personal policy of selling unplayed games so we decided to play it.

Cacao is a tile laying game, but it is nothing like Carcassonne :D. You can explain it under 12 minutes and the rules are easy to grasp. Cacao plays, relatively, fast. The game components are adequate but the art is very good. The game looks gorgeous on the table.

The decisions needed to play aren’t very complex, but they aren’t obvious either (Light-Medium weight). Due to this, Cacao is perfect for the family. It has some luck with the tiles, but I feel you can control it, so it doesn’t bothers me.

Best with 3 players.

On the bad side, it seems the first players are at a disadvantage because the last players can react to what they do. This effect is felt near the end of the game. I need to play more to see if this is an issue or not

Bottom line, Cacao is an ok Euro game. It is perfect for the family but I feel it is way too light for us. I already sold my copy of the game but I’m open to play it again if requested.

Excellent little tile laying game.  Plays fast and fewer rules to learn than Carcassonne.  I prefer this over it too because of the length, to me it offers much of the same feel with maybe a quarter of the play time.  Plays well at all player counts in my opinion.  Lots of little promos/expansions for this but I think base game works fine.

RATING: 6
This is a fun game that plays quickly and has some interesting (but certainly not overly complex) decisions to be made.  I've really been enjoying Cacao with two players and also enjoyed a four player game.  I think it will be best with 3 players.  

It is interesting how the order in which the jungle tiles are revealed determines what path of scoring to follow.  I've played games where barely any cacao fruits were available near the beginning of the game, and I've also played games where the cacao fruits were abundant throughout the game.  Choosing how many workers to focus on the various scoring opportunities is really interesting, and I feel like no particular approach (pushing the water track, gathering and selling fruit, or focusing on scoring temples) is dominant.  The sun tokens provide for some really fun decisions as the end game approaches.

The Chocolatl expansion adds the ability to do something with the coins/water beside just earning points. I think it is a significant improvement over the base game.

Cacao is an excellent tile-laying game that uses the mechanic in a unique and excellent way.  Having knowledge of what tiles are possible to be used and combating with your opponents' placements are key strategies to pulling out a win.  Possibly the only thing I have against the game is if you don't follow a pattern when handing out rewards for tiles, you can get a little lost and may have to backtrack to make sure you scored everything properly.  However, long as you take the same steps each time, this can be heavily negated.  I'm definitely a big fan of this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game provides the same satisfying tile-laying experience familiar to those who enjoy Carcassonne. Cacao presents enough differences to make this a welcome alternative when you have burned yourself out on that excellent title. The addition of the "Chocolatl" expansion raises the rating of this game to a '10'.  (Volcanos promo adds a very slight "take-that" element to the game, as well as some aesthetic flourishes. Worth the investment.)

Played a partial game, along with the expansion, by myself to learn the rules.  No longer excited about this.  Not sure I will take this one to the table.  The decisions are not compelling.  I lay my tile then I lay a jungle tile.  The expansions give some additional choices and make the cash more meaningful, but in the end, there just is not very much here.  

I thought I would like it, despite the fact that JohnGetsGames panned it.  I thought there would be enough there to hold my interest.  I may give it a try at the table, but right now, there are too many other good games I would rather explore.

For a family market game, Cacao is well received by gamers. It's a tile-laying game in the vein of Carcassonne, but with an added economy. Players' tiles feature a differing number of workers on the borders. By laying their tiles with workers next to plantations, cacao is harvested which can be sold by placing next to markets. Mines give immediate points, settling next to water is important to turn penalty points into victory points.

While the idea is well thought-out, the play didn't grab me. There's less variability, less need for risk assessment and conflict than at its obvious comparison, Carcassonne. Important neutral tiles coming up at the right time negate the perceived higher influence by having three tiles on hand at a time. I'd rather play Carcassonne instead and like Walker-Harding's previous effort Sushi Go better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cacao has some interesting interactions that I wouldn't expect from a tile-laying game. However, the luck of the tile draw is more pronounced here than in most others. The water specifically can result in a shut-out that can cost you dearly. And the amulet tokens mechanism is goofy.

This game is over twice as good as Chocolatl!

This is a great tile laying game. The alternating tile pattern works really well and allows for interesting combos and strategies. The base game is a bit simple for what it is but It can be played as a gateway successfully. Can't wait to get the expansion for this. Absolutely recommend it.

I don't have any tile-laying games in my collection (Carcasonne doesn't really appeal to me. I haven't played it, but I'd really like to before I purchase it) and this one seemed to fit my tastes.

What a great tile laying game with so many options for scoring: collect and sell Cacaos, work mines, worship at Temples, etc.  I really like the overbuilding mechanic with sun dials for late game scoring opportunities.

RATING: 6.9
Fine for what it is - an introductory, Euro-like family game. 
It's tile-laying and everyone does have a Carcassonne meeple but Carc is not the closest relative of it. Traces of Carc predecessor El Caballero appear (different number of meeple on the tile sides), just like the placement rules of Samurai - The Card Game. The way you score (about five different ways) is very Euro; I wonder how fun it is for beginners, but it's fine. I'd like to play more to know if it is indeed shallow (that's how it felt after first play, which is not a big problem for what it is) or has some hidden tricks up in its sleeve.
Also, I'm a big fan of Claus Stephan but I did not recognize his artwork - it felt more like the now-popular style of Harald Lieske. (Yes, it's practical and eye-pleasing as usual.)

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Wasn't planning on ever playing this one but a friend brought it out and I had an extra 30 minutes so we gave it a go. It was a pleasant diversion although quite tactical as a two player game. I think it might shine with 3 players. I can see this possibly being a spouse approved and suggested game. I don't need to own this one, but am happy to play someone else's copy. The worker tile play reminds me a bit of El Caballero without as much of the nastiness.

An excellent game with a less difficult scoring mechanism when compared to Carcassonne.  However this was an unintended purchase due to drink damage occurring while we played someone else's copy.  We dried off this copy and bought him a new one.  At least the game was a good one.  Also have Big Market, Golden Temple, Volcanoes, and Die Lichtung promos.  Have the Chocolatl expansion with New Huts and New Storage Spaces promos.

Cacao is an interesting tile-placement game, which mechanics isn’t similar to Carcassonne mechanics. It’s atypical that we have meeples drawn on tiles. But “meeple tiles” mechanics really works and forces us to many decisions. The rules are simple, and game lasts no more than 30 minutes. At the end of the game, there’s a strategic depth element if we have sun tokens. Cacao is game for wide range of players. For me, for geek- it’s interesting filler, and because of simplicity of rules, many families will find it’s game enjoyable.

[b]Scratches the Carcassonne tile-laying itch. I like that you have three of your own tiles to choose from, that the coins allow you to re-use a location, and that other players also benefit from where you place the jungle tiles, so you have to weigh your moves carefully.
The chessboard pattern of player and jungle tiles is pretty to look at.[/b]

A good lightweight game that could be used as a gateway game to teach worker placement. It has quick and easy gameplay, that's easy enough for non gamers, but has a little meat on its bones as well.

The artwork takes you back 10 years to a simpler time when eurogames looked bland. Beneath ugly surface you usually found great streamlined rules too, well-oiled machines. This game really takes you back 10 years - with its good sides aswell. The simplicity (and depth) feels like breath of fresh air when we're bombarded with games where the designer throws 20 random mechanics  together to make it "deep". That's not how you make deep, look at Go and its popularity guys. Anyway, very nice game.

It is a pleasant game, but it's over very quickly and there's not a lot of tension to it. The people who badmouth Carcassonne in comparison to it must have played Carc wrong, or not cutthroat enough (maybe they didn't want to). Cacao is barely half as long and mostly lacking the blockage or screwage there is in a tight race for points or farmer mayority in a competitive game of Carc. Cacao is a nice, quick filler with pretty components though, and sometimes that's good enough.

Edit: Sold Oct'15. Carc just scratches that itch better for us and since I'd like to try Lanterns or Isle of Skye in the near future, I'm probably set with tile laying games for quite some time to come.

Edit: I've since bought Isle of Skye and haven't looked back. It's just a much more interesting and meatier game with similarly easy rules and short playtime. In hindsight, Cacao was just too simplistic for our taste.

A great little tile placement game by Phil-Walker Harding. Really fun and easy to get into as a gateway game for anyone.

I will not play without the expansions and promos as they add quite a bit of variety to the game.

I will however say that I don't like games that come with a set number of rounds that forces you to remove tiles from the game to add expansions and promos. It just means you're improving the game with the expansions and you can't really use all of your content without a hassle of switching it back.

Solid tile-laying game with simple rules but some tough decisions. It's played in a grid and scoring tiles are placed, every time there's an empty space orthogonal between two player tiles.

Smooth playing tile-placement game where your tactical choices are minimized due to a low hand limit.  What happens when you activate a tile is rather boring.  The value of placement options are easily calculable.  This makes me feel like there is little need for a human player: the game invites to you to go through the simple, but tedious math exercise of calculating your optimal move every play.

In Cacao sind die Spieler Kakao-Bauern im tiefsten Dschungel und versuchen Siegpunkte zu erhalten. Der Spielablauf ist denkbar einfach: Immer wenn ein Spieler an der Reihe ist, legt er ein eigenes Arbeiterplättchen an ein Dschungelplättchen. Dabei muss immer ein Schachbrettmuster entstehen. An den bier Ecken des Arbeitsplättchens sind unterschiedlich viele Arbeiter zu sehen (von 0 - 3). Die Arbeiter nutzen nun das angrenzende Dschungelplättchen. Sie ernten Kakao, verkaufen diesen, schürfen nach Gold oder verbessern die Wasserversorgung. So geht es reihum, bis alle Plättchen gelegt wurden und es folgt die Endwertung. Cacao ist ein super einfaches Spiel, ist flott gespielt und macht eine Menge Spaß.

Another wonderful tile-laying game and the strongest design yet from Aussie designer Phil Walker-Harding of Sushi Go fame. 

Players take turns to play a tile to the jungle in an attempt to collect cacao pods, gain access to temples, find fresh water springs and find gold in mines. 

The trick is that ach tile has a number of meeple symbols printed around the edge and by placing these so that they connect to features of other tiles to score or collect. 

Very clever rules allow for interesting tile placement considerations. 

Having learned Cacao and Lanterns in the same weekend I definitely feel that they both share a similar soul and weight of gameplay but Cacao has just a slightly stronger edge for gamers. 

Playing in 20-30 minutes this game is a winner all the way and deserving of being on the SdJ shortlist.

Pleasant gateway level tile laying game for the family and a filler for gamers.  Only one play thus far.  Nothing I needed to buy, but it is quick and fun.  Has some similarities to Lanterns (i.e. both are tile laying games, where you can get benefits on other players turns), but is slightly better(components) and more thematic IMHO.

Well finally got a 2nd play in with 4 players. I really like how the competitiveness of this game scales with the type of players.  Very good filler+ type game.

The tile-laying mechanic used in this game feels familiar and approachable while possessing a puzzle-y twist since tiles function as worker placement to generate resources of varying types/amounts from some tiles and contribute to area majority on other tiles. There is also an element of player interaction as communal tile-placement can benefit other players as well as yourself so those benefits have to be weighed carefully.

It's smart without being too think-y, plays quickly, and it has a great aesthetic—the translation of the theme into the colors and the design create a really appealing presentation.

A great tile-placement game that works very well at all player counts.  It's fairly quick to play, too, once you understand how the jungle tiles trigger/work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In this tile placing game, players first put down a tile which contains workers, which could be located on all 4 sides of the tile. You then place jungle tiles, and the workers do the action on the tile: get goods, sell goods, get water, compete for temples or get sun tokens. The jungle tiles vary in value (sell for 4 versus 2, or some tiles give you two times as many goods as other tiles).

It is light, and it is engaging. I think there is good dose of luck on the jungle tiles that you draw. You coudl argue you could place beside good ones after they show up, but they may have been exploited by your opponents already, leaving you with less space. Still, there are a few things to think about.

This was a super fun game.  I never really liked Carcassonne because I always thought the farmers were a bit wonky to keep track of and frankly, stupid.

THIS is what I really liked as far as tile laying.  Great decisions, interesting moves to make, and even a special power to use towards the end of the game!

Tile-laying game that seems super-fun halfway through the rules explanation but doesn't quite live up to the promise. Maybe it felt like there was a lot of potential for actions and Things!!!! but really came down to a rather simple collect & sell central mechanic. Still quite enjoyable though.

Not great with four as there aren't enough water tiles. It's nice and short, but the common tiles are so imbalanced that too much of the game depends on lucky tiles being flipped before your turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
The production value is good, it combines good components (mostly cardboard, some wood) with nice illustrations and efficient simbology.

It's a full abstract tile lying game where every tile you place interacts with its neighbouring tiles. The rules are simple, easy to teach and the game can be played at a decent pace, although some episodes of brief AP are likely to occur at some points, especially when the game is advanced.

Overall, it is a very light game. Most of it revolves around being to place around the best tiles when they appear. And this is perhaps the art I dislike the most about this game, because not only this "lucky evenement" will benefit you once, you will be able to benefit from this great tile once again because you can place tiles above your own tiles, thus, duplicating the effect of luck.

Nonetheless, it's short enough to forget about this and enjoy the experience.

Cacao is a nice game. Players have individual "decks" of square worker tiles. Each tile has four workers, allocated in different distributions to the four sides: 1/1/1/1, 1/2/1/0, 1/3/0/0 etc. The players build a mutual map of the jungle, alternating worker tiles and jungle tiles (i.e. making a checkerboard). Workers "act" on the jungle tile adjacent to them - a worker tile that is surrounded may get a payoff from all four touching jungle tiles. Jungle tiles provide different benefits and effects.
The goal is to get the highest score, and the game ends when everyone runs out of worker tiles. Thematically the game is about farming cacao and selling it - the art and pieces support the theme, but the theme is hardly integral.
Cacao is not super deep, but there is certainly enough to think about given the duration. After a couple of plays it will rattle along - 30 minutes with four players, 15-20 with two. Teaching is a breeze.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This initially took a hit after getting a flurry of initial plays. While the decision space is relatively light it has recently begun to hit the table more when looking for a quick game to play. As of now it has surpassed Carc as our tile laying game of choice, a big reason is the quick game play. We also got both sets of promo tiles which I really like, especially the ones from the Advent calendar.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The first tile laying game that I would put in the filler category.
- It plays fast (20 minutes tops) and has enough decisions to remain engaging. 
- Worker placement tiles are a great idea, you activate the tiles you place your worker tiles next to if there are workers facing that tile.
- Excellent production values, everything is top notch (thick tiles/ player boards, and really nice cacao pieces). 
- I really like the theme/artwork, it is simple but still beautiful to look at.[/i]

Played it with 2 and 4 players, and got the feeling that the replayability might be high in theory, but since this game is not very complex, You are basically doing the same thing, so after a while it might loose its appeal to people who like to devise various strategies. Still, it could be a fine easy-going family game where fun increases proportionally to the number of players (find it rather boring as a 2 player)

RATING: 7
At first blush it's got that old-school Carcassonne-y feel, maybe because the game's been in gestation for quite a few years, of choosing where to place your tile for best point-scoring effect. It then departs. There's a number of things you can place your tile next to in order to fulfil various point mechanics - water, suns, shells, straight VP's, end-game area-majorities and the like. But the neat thing is, in the final few turns, you can overlay a tile you've previously placed and score it all again. So your 9 turns are not just about doing the best you can right now, but creating end-game setups to take advantage of as well. It's otherwise a fairly standard tile placement Euro that works well for what it is, but that twist did elevate it a bit, earning an immediate second play which doesn't happen too often in that genre for me.

Light, yet fun, tile laying game.  It really is "collect stuff and turn it in for points", but the mechanic of workers aligning the edges of your tiles really works and I enjoy the spatial considerations in the game.  There is some luck as to when the water tiles and the 4 gold exchange rate market tiles get flipped, but there is room for tactical and strategic play.  I enjoy it much more than Carcassonne.

RATING: 7
This is a delightful tile laying game that takes the idea of having your meeples printed on tiles that you get a hand of from El Caballero, but streamlines the heck out of it into this beautiful and fun experience. The general idea is this. Each player has a pile of worker tiles that have some combination of 4 workers spread across two or more sides of the tile. On your turn you place the tile next to a terrain tile, then if there's an empty spot on the map that would be next to two worker tiles, you fill it in with a terrain tile from the display, and then you activate all the workers who are now next to newly placed terrain tiles. The game plays quickly, and has a very short and easy to understand rule book. The game allows for interesting tactical play as you try to line up future good moves for yourself, while trying to capitalize on your opponent's placements. 

The Cacao expansion adds a lot of polish to the game, so if possible try to play with the expansion in it's entirety even on the first play.

Quick to play but uninteresting game overall. There isn't much strategy in this game, obvious moves after another and the tile randomness swings the game a lot. The 4-player game took about 60 minutes and it just felt too long, the longish playing wasn't the biggest issue but rather the boring experience overall. Last but least the game doesn't really bring any new ideas, we have seen it all before, and in better games. I'd much rather play many other more interesting tile laying games, for example Lanterns, Carcassonne, Glen More or Isle of Skye.

This is an interesting game, that will be compared to Carcassone as it is a tile laying/exploration game. I think Carcassone is a decent game, but Cacao removes a lot of the random elements of Carcassone. And the game is pretty nicely balanced, since your opponent will generally be able to benefit from the jungle tiles you put down too. 
It's a simplish game, but has good elements of strategy to it. So it's definitely a good one to consider for newer/casual gamers - which is a nice plus. It's not a go-to game for me, but plays quickly and is certainly one I'd be happy to play again and one that I'm happy is in our collection!

Unique tile placement and resource management game with a checkerboard distribution of workers and action tiles, where you do the action the amount of times that you place a worker facing towards that side of the tile. Lots of fun, easy to teach, every time I introduce the game to new people it's been very well received. It's not terribly deep but it gives you just enough to think about that the game is very satisfying.

Also some fun promos and expansions to go with it. I kind of wish the chocolate production module was included in the base game, as people get a little disappointed that they can't just buy the one game and get everything included, but hopefully a future edition will include it.

This is an excellent game, and one of my main goto gateway games.

This is Cacassonne light, pretty much. Thus, I rank it lower. Good gateway game, but at the end of the day, Carcassonne offers much more for just a bit more complexity.

I liked this one a lot at first. There is such a huge turn order disadvantage that we now see reverse turn order mirroring exactly the finishing positions 90% of the time. It should be an easy fix, but it needs to be addressed otherwise we just can't be bothered to play it any more. Scores are so close that with experienced players it's bam, bam, bam in the last couple of rounds and the start player has zero chance of winning.

At first glance I was thinking it was just another Carcassonne variant, but that's not the case. A chess board tile laying system, filling in the gaps with jungle tiles that trigger different effects is a newish feeling (okay, slightly reminiscent of Carcassonne the Castle). I really liked the end game idea of building over your previous huts using sun tiles - it makes your previous placements even more important that you've got a good mixture and choice.

My only criticism is that when serious gamers bring it to the table and count scores nearing the end, the start player has a huge disadvantage and the last player a huge advantage. When games are decided by just a couple of points the final player can play accordingly and manipulate majorities, while the start player can just sit and watch her score being picked on by the final three players. There are ways for the early players in a round to counter this slightly, but it's definitely harder to win for them. (On the other hand, it can be a good handicap mechanism when playing with new players and younger children.) It loses a couple of rating points with me for the turn order issue - especially with four players.

Learning and teaching the rules is quick and painless. The game has a good pace - no downtime at all around here - there's a fair bit of planning you can do when it's not your turn - with room for a quick adjustment if something juicy crops up. Best of all everyone is having fun - no major brain burning, but some reasonable decision making to be made. At half an hour time investment I'd love to rate this highly if it weren't for the turn order issue.

RATING: 4
Not bad for a quick filler, just felt like, as with most tile-laying games out there, that the game was playing me. Maintain a hand of 3 tiles and optimize in 5 different methods of scoring (collect + sell cacao, straight-up VPs, majority end-game scoring, moving your pawn up a track and powers that let you overbuild your own tiles). There aren't that many options for placing your tile (i.e. simple rotation), which keeps the analysis time manageable.

2+2

Fun little tile-laying game with some nods to Carcassonne, but with a little choice - something that doesn't exist in Carc.  Colorful tiles, nice bits, and entertaining gets this a solid 7 - and that's saying something for me when it comes to light games.

2016: 8.  I've played only a couple of games so far, but I've really enjoy the light, casual nature of the game.  You have to think tactically, and there's some short term planning, but nothing that's going to melt your brain. The game's curve from "limited moves" to "many moves" in the end game is a really pleasant experience.

It's not at the top of my "buy list" but this would be a good addition to my collection.

Cacao is a great tile-laying game and one of the very, very few of that genre in my collection. I love it so much because the game looks great, can be taught quickly due to the minimal rule set and lack over overly gamery stuff (other than the sun token/build-over mechanism) and it can be played casually with non-gamers or strategically with hobby gamers. Overall, Cacao is an elegant game

Már szabály alapján éreztem, hogy jó játék lesz a Cacao. Gyors, egyszerű a szabály. Mindenki adott munkáés lapkakészlettel kezd, ebből helyez le a körében egyet a dzsungel lapkák mellék sakktábla szerűen. Egy dzsungel mellé egy munkáslapka. A dzsungel folyamatosan bővül, ahogy a munkáslapkákat lehelyezik a játékosok. Különböző akciók érhetők el az élszomszédos munkásokkal. Egyszerű, gyors, könnyed játék, ami véleményem szerint minden játékosszámmal jól működik, de majd ezt több játék után megítélem. Hárman tökéletes volt. A Carcassonne-hoz hasonlítják, szerintem annál jóval jobb játék. Nagyon erős 7-es, gyanús, hogy 8-as is lesz belőle.

[2015-12-24]
Kicsit úgy érezzük, hogy az utolsónak jövő játékosnak előnye van, lehet ezt kellett volna valamilyen módon kompenzálni, de majd 10 játék után mondok erre véglegeset. Az biztos, hogy ketten is ugyanolyan jó, mint hárman.

1 play, 4er

This is a neat little tile-laying / worker-placement game. It plays pretty quickly and has some interesting choices, although too short and bland for my tastes. It did, however, seem pretty popular in the room. I wonder if they have variants like for Qin, where players each set the order of their own tiles, or pick starting hand, etc?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have identical decks of player-tiles, shuffled -- draw a hand of 3 from your own deck. These have 4 workers distributed around the edges -- 1/3, 1/2/1, or 1/1/1/1. Two exploration-tiles start in the center of the table, touching diagonally. The rest of these tiles are shuffled into a deck, putting 2 on display. These tiles show one of a variety of things:
- 1 or 2 VP
- 1 or 2 cacao
- cacao market, where you can sell a cacao for 2/3/4 VP
- water, to advance your Meeple on the water track of your player board
- coin, to collect a coin (sabe max 3 at a time)
- temple, worth 6/3 at end of game to 1st/2nd place area control

On your turn, play a tile from your hsnd onto the table, orthogonal to another tile. If you create an L with another player-tile, take one of the exploration tiles from display and place it there. Then, all workers adjacent to the newest tile(s) work, each producing whatever is on the tile (eg if your 3-worker edge touches a 1 VP tile, you get 3 VP). Once all exploration tiles have been played, you may spend a coin to play on top of one of your previously placed tiles (max one tile high). 

The game ends when everyone has played all their player tiles. Score VP for temples (area influence) and distance traveled on water. Most VP wins.

Very light but fun tile laying game, a sub category I pretty much always enjoy. The theme is thin but I don't mind, I like the tweak where you don't place any meeples but they are imprinted to the side of your tiles so which side of your tile touches the scoring tiles is important. "Cacao" is nothing to shout from the roof tops but I can have fun with these type of simple games.

Played at EsCon 2016. I was curious about this after having tried to play it on Yucata and having NO idea what I was doing. It's a very simple tile game. Something to introduce people to the hobby with but way too light for my desired game weight level.

RATING: 8.3
This was my Carcassone killer until I played Isle of Skye. Luckily there are so many implementations of Carcassone that it can be killed multiple times (and still happily live on in my iPad).

If you're looking for a game that says "chocoholic and proud", I didn't really feel the cacao-ness; the crop in question could just as easily been yams. You never brew the beans to energize or to comfort yourself after your opponent advances far past you on the water track. Perhaps the Chocolatl expansion scratches some of that itch. 

Still, it's a fast and tidy game with enough theme to justify inflicting some light Aztec roleplay on a long-suffering gaming partner, which is all I really want.

My wife and I have played multiple 2 player games and as a 2 player game Cacao is a 5.5 or 6 and was on the bubble of making our collection.  This weekend we had a chance to play both a 3 player and 4 player game.  As a 3 player game Cacao is a 6 to 7, but as a 4 player game it is a strong 7 and possibly a 7.5 and will stay in our collection.  I gave Cacao a 7 because it does play well at higher player counts, but I don't see myself ever playing it again with 2.

I have played a prototype version last weekend. 
It is a very nice game to play with family and friends.
The illustration is very good, you can dive into the  exotic world of the "fruit of the Gods".

It is easy to learn and even people who do not play very often, enjoyed it. It is not a hight strategic game but you really have to think hard about some tiles before placing them, in order not to help the other players score.

We had great fun playing it with some teens. They enjoyed it and wanted to play it over and over again.

A great little tile-laying game that's been a favourite with my wife and me. Several paths to victory meaning a nice amount of strategy to optimise your points while trying to minimise others' opportunity to score. Quality components and a nice clear art style means the symbols on the tiles and player boards are easy to decode and follow. The only drawback is that multiple plays will mean this game loses its lustre slightly...but that's where the expansion modules come in!

tl;dr: fine family game

A family friendly tile laying game. I don't personally see the need for more takes on the genre, but that doesn't mean this game isn't worth playing. Like most games in the genre the rules are easy to digest and strategic options don't fly all over the place. But there are a couple of different strategies to explain. Some of them might not be as viable as others, but from this first play I can't say that for certain.
Anyway, it's a solid enough and not boring. In fact, it's rather enjoyable, just very unexceptional.

Cacao is a simple tile laying game that has some similarities to Carcassonne, except you can play tiles anywhere. The tiles let you collect cacao beans, sell them for points, and get points in other ways. I generally like tile laying, so I enjoyed my plays of this even though it didn't do anything particularly special. My plays so far have only been with 2 players, but I think it would be more fun with more.

Just when it seems like tile laying games can't possibly be unique, we find yet another to add to our collection.  (Yes, this is one of our favorite mechanics.)  We've played and enjoyed this with both 2P and 4P.  Scores tend to be fairly tight most of the time, but in 4P it's very, very easy to miss out on water entirely if the person who goes after you is the one who places it.  However, even when that happens it's not impossible to make up points other ways so you never feel like you should just give up.

Very tentative rating. I probably didnt get the rules and i was just dragged by the computer implementation. It seems extremely dry but with a possibily intersting mechanic

Fun easy game to play. You and the others create a checkboard pattern look to the game by placing your tiles. I have played it with 2 and 3 players. I like the 3 players better. This is a good family game.

RATING: 7
Light and breezy theme, scales well from 2-4 players. If you're anything more than a casual or family gamer, you'll need the expansion to add some strategic depth and to keep things interesting. One of those you don't need to play more than 2 or 3 times a year, but that's okay.

Family oriented tile placement farming simulation planting cacoa fields, selling beans at market, and discovering temples and lakes in the jungle. Charming and elegant tile placement serves to reveal jungle territories and align workers for area control scoring, production, selling goods. Can get a little AP and simple mathy nearing end game.

simple tile laying game - great gateway game, plays in about an hour. Play worker tiles from your hand to connect to jungle tiles with resources or markets or temples.

awesome game! Like it even more than Carcassonne. Think I will buy the expansion soon because it needs expansions.

Of all the BGG categories, "family game" seems to be the most screwed up.  It's like a Caesar's salad where anything and everything is allowed, including peanut better, rocket fuel, and a touch of chlamydia.

Assuming that "family" is an appropriate label for Cacao (and maybe it is), it still doesn't deserve its current status of #130.  There are way more than 129 family-style games that are better than this, including my 120 favorite variants of de-lousing my hair.

I was hooked the first time i saw a preview of it. Then a review solidified this and after actually playing it i can confirm it is a solid euro with some Carcassonne thrown into it and maximizing your points in various places. I don't usually like such games. But Cacao is super light and quick and placing and rotating those tiles with workers feels very nice and rewarding. I would rate it even higher, but i fear that the excitement can wear of after some time because of this games simplicity.

Theme/Art:
I really love the theme and art, it simply looks amazing. The theme fits the game, you lead a tribe to victory by harvesting and selling cacao represented by lovely cacao token.

Production quality:
The tiles are made of cardboard and look very high quality, every tribe has a classic meeple as a water carrier, and the token for cacao are beautiful.

Replayability:
Since the players create the board (jungle) each game is very different, but you chase after the same goal.

Depth/Difficulty:
It's not very hard to learn, but it does require some strategy and forethought.

Strategy:
You have a very limited range of tiles, only 3 at a time in your hand and you need to acquire good spots and jungle tiles before they are gone. The placement of your tiles should also be considered.

Luck:
You draw your tiles from a shuffled stack, but there are only 4 different tiles. The jungle is also generated from a stack and only 2 jungle-tiles are visible at a time.

Cacao takes 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the game.

I think it's a fun and beautiful little game and I am looking forward to it's expansion Chocolatl.

To its benefit, it was easy to learn and play.

But once playing, uninterested by the mechanisms at play and the involvement.

Perhaps it may be that I am not a tile-laying game fan.  But I love Tigris and Euphrates.

Played in Essen (2015). A light-weight tile-laying game with a Cacao (plantation) theme. A little bit reminiscent of Carcassonne (tiles are the same size) but the actual mechanism is a bit turned around, since you do not place your meeples on the tiles but they are printed on your tiles.
 

Let me explain. The game starts with a Cacao plantation and temple tile placed diagonally. Each player has a stack of personal tiles with workers on the sides, three of which are in his hand. The jungle tiles are in a common stack, and two of them are visible. The goal is to place your tiles in the jungle in such a way that you earn the most gold. The game ends after all players have placed their personal tiles.
 

In each round a player places one of his tiles so it borders on jungle tiles. If any then he checks if he created a "corner space" (two player-tiles bordering diagonally with an empty space between), if created (one or two) such spaces, he can then pick jungle cards to place there. After that worker activation is checked. Any workers on any player tiles that face jungle cards this turn are activated and perform whatever jungle tile they border on: get Cacao beans, bring water, worship at temples (this is only counted at the end of the game), sell Cacao, dig for gold ...
 

It was a fun light game, that would make a good filler or gateway game. We didn't buy it but we did buy the fair special tiles, just in case.

Not a big fan of tile laying games in general. But the "worker placement" and mild resource management mechanics in Cacao set it apart.
Good depth for this kind of games.

Sad to see this one go. I love tile-laying games and this has just the right amount of thinkiness. Unfortunately my wife really disliked it so it'll never get played.

Szuper játék, gyors, egyszerű filler, de pont annyi mélységgel, h nem csak a kezdők fogják élvezni. Okos inzert, kis méret, élvezetes és nagyon pörgős játékmenet - utazáshoz is ajánlott.

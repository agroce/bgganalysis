Very absorbing game, no dice, small and portable, table size requirements grow exponentially after the first 2 levels, very unique in how it uses symbols for identifying location of objects, characters etc. you can collect points by killing or exiting the dungeon, permutations are endless since you can rotate rooms and fully transform dungeons multiple times during one's turn, can present with impossible situations as a puzzler

I need to play this some more, but it fell flat for me. I like the idea of rotating rooms affecting game play...works well in that old labyrinth game with the dragon, but had a hard time seeing it with the way cards lay out. Really want to try the full board game version of this.

1st plays: Played 2 tutorial missions and am really not sure what to think.  I love the character variety, and the ruleset seems like it is simple, but the way the tutorial is presented makes it feel more complicated than it is.  Plenty of weird edge cases that are not easy to look up.  Still, it did sort-of feel like the board game version, though that one is probably better.  This was only $15 whereas the board game version is out of print and sells for at least $60.  Bang for the buck is with this version I think.

No second play, really no desire to play again.  The board game is a lot better.

почитал правила. практически один в один как настольная (даже сценарии примерно те же, но нет соло-варианта), с двумя небольшими примечательными изменениями: AP теперь просто генерируется как ресурс на +3 каждый ход (но неиспользованные очки можно запасать впрок до общего максимума в 6 AP), карты боя можно при желании разыгрывать в качестве карт прыжка (но отдельные карты прыжка всё равно остались), и ещё верёвку теперь нельзя оставлять висящей над пропастью (видимо, просто потому что для пропасти нет отдельной иконки локации на картах). 

поле стало меньше, т.к. теперь вместо клеток у каждого тайла 4 зоны. возможно, игра будет идти динамичнее. зато автор развернулся по полной, добавив просто прорву новых персонажей.

в отзывах пишут, что из-за отсутствия фигурок в и без того мозголомную игру добавился ещё один слой абстракта - постоянно мысленно визуализировать, где кто находится. многие используют миплов из других игр и другие жетоны.

Despite its small box size, there is a normal and very satisfying board game in there. Addition of your own meeples will make the game alot easier to "read" and more pleasant in eye.

Wow, an entire big box universe in a card game.  Being a fan of compact playability this is the "ideal" dungeon twister.  I never pull the big oaf out anymore.  Btw I use yellow and blue colored cubes in zones conjunction for ease of play. Now if they could just make a portable twilight imperium card game I'm in!!!!

A lot of game in a little box. The mechanisms are solid and the game is engaging. Unfortunately, this card-only game suffers for what it lacks component-wise, relative to the board game version. The mechanism for indicating the position of characters and items is impressive at first glance, but the lack of physical markers on the tiles makes it impossible to get a feel for the game state at a glance. A game already prone to facilitating analysis paralysis certainly didn't need additional turn time tacked on, as players mentally exert themselves deciphering the circumstances presented on each turn. The artwork is good, but inconsistent, and these flaws drop an otherwise great game below a potentially stronger rating. Still worth the time to play it though, and there will be nothing else like it on your shelf.

RATING: N/A
Tokens make the game a lot easier.  I find it amusing how many people complain that the game would have been better had it had tokens... why not just add some?  It isn't all to difficult to add little cubes, gems, lego pieces, coins, whatever...

I personally use blue and yellow cubes for the players' characters and red ones for items.  Granted you still need to see what character the cube goes to, but it does make processing the game a whole lot easier and quicker.

This game is a really great idea that I would much prefer to see in a board game.  Now that I've played the board game version, I can't see playing the card game again.  As far as how the game plays out, the card game version is wonderful.  However, it's just too hard to make out where everything is located in this version.  I'm sure it could be done with a lot of plays, but it isn't for me.  I'll play the board game.

Very similar to the board game. A little difficult to remember where characters are standing. Otherwise it is dungeon twister in a portable form with lots packed into the box. I like the zonal movement, it's not quite as restrictive as some of the boards in latter DT releases.

RATING: 7.5
Very big game in a little box. I've never played the board game, but this is more complex and engaging than many board games: it's challenging, very thematic, highly competitive, and quite fun. The way you abstractly move around the map takes a little getting used to, but it works amazingly well: I'm surprised this mechanic hasn't been used in more games. 

The best part of the game is the sheer number of characters, items, and possible map layouts, which make this an infinitely replayable "sandbox" game. You can do a simple, 10-minute session or an epic 1-hour battle. You can keep the complexity to a minimum or add all the bells and whistles for mind-bending problem solving. Great travel game.

lesson learned: only buy games you are excited about,not those based on other peoples suggestions.

 I bought this because of Tom Vassels review. The game has a lot of shifting cards and as a result you forget where you are, what room your in, and which items are yours. Plus there are SO MANY symbols....literally every character has its own symbol which isnt necessarily intuitive. So, you will be referring back to the manual a lot and probably forgetting your powers here and there. The game fell flat in every group game play. Gave it away twice saying "keep it if you like it" both times it was returned to me.

RATING: 9
DT is one of the best 2-player games.
Veterans own up to 10 different boxes.

The card game is faithful to his big brother. Great.
You have quite 3 big boxes in this small package.

I really recommend it if you don't know about DT or just own one single box as creating your own team before entering the dungeon adds a lot to the game.

I own many boxes and I like this compact version as it's more nervy and it takes just one hand to hold it !

I hear the underlying game is great, but I wouldn't know-- the card game implementation makes it too hard to pick out relevant details (like which zone of a card, if any, a character is in).

This might become playable with the addition of a few meeples, but playing as written was dispiriting enough that I am not sure I'll try.

A shockingly good adaptation of the system. The cards are a bit clumsy to use to track character location, so some spare meeples help immensely. This is almost made up for by the great variety of characters--25 in a cheap base game! Probably, on balance, the best version of DT in terms of value and ease of storage/transport/setup.

I have yet to play the original, but this one isn't bad anyway. I have mixed feelings about this one. One hand hand, it's very tactical and offers a good amount of options, on the other hand, it's somewhat confusing as all cards just lay next to the "board".

I don't think that I will buy this one, but I'm looking foward to the original. However, this is a really cool cardgame, completely different from most other card games.

I just found out about this. My favorite game EVER is Dungeon Twister so, for me, this is a must buy. However I´m not sure how I feel about this one. Probably it will let me down (because I expect a lot from DT) but I have to have it.

At last I got to play the game, I like that it comes with most (if not all) previous objects and characters, I’m not sure how many but I will find out soon. This is a good DT implementation, the game doesn’t changes much and it is still a brain burner, however visualizing where you characters are is much more challenging. I’m afraid this new edition means that there aren’t going to be more expansions and support for the older game :cry:, I’m still waiting to buy the Traps expansion. 

The friend who explained it to me just confirmed he made a lot of rules mistakes, so I will read the rules soon, for now I would play again and then I will re comment.

Bottom line, Dungeon Twister: The Card game is a very good game, however, I don’t see any point of playing this over the original Dungeon Twister, Its only advantage is the added portability.

I finally read the rules for the game and played it without mistakes :D. I can say I like the game A LOT, however as I thought before, it isn’t a replacement for me. I didn’t play he tutorial, I jumped for the full game right away.

Dungeon Twister: The Card Game is very similar to its predecessor, however it is also much lighter because the rooms only have 4 areas instead of the 25 of the original. Just by making this change the options and complexity were reduced a lot. The only complicated aspect of the card game is the visualization of where are the characters and objects. This can be especially hard when moving as you can unexpectedly get blocked. However getting accustomed to it, isn’t that hard. Another aspect that makes easier this edition for the game is the number of actions, you get 3 actions each turn and can save up to 3. In the previous game how you played your action cards was paramount, here it isn’t a factor because each turn is the same I this regard.
 
Playtime is reduced as you can travel the maze a lot quicker.
 
The art is ok an the gameplay remains interesting. It has a very low luck factor so the player who plan the best will win. The game comes with many of the previous characters (around 3 expansions I think), but some of them changed a bit (the Paladin now gets an additional point for killing an undead character).

Bottom line, I would love the game had I not played its boardgame version. As it stands I really liked it but there is no real reason to play the card game over the board game. This makes for a funny situation among my gaming priorities as Dungeon Twister: The Card Game is a good game that has a very low priority in my gaming matrix, but I will keep it and buy any expansions they release (although their release is unlikely as I think the game didn’t do well). If I didn’t have all the Dungeon Twister games I would play this one a lot, it is a great game with a small package.

Very similar to the board game with two advantages: more content (lots of characters) and small package. But one major disadvantage: too much information to understand the board state. For a game with tendency to generate AP, this difficulty to understand what is going on make this card version worst compared to the board game.

A táblajátékhoz képest lenyűgözően sok dolog van benne (rengeteg karakter) alacsonyabb áron. Szerintem maga a rendszer is döbbenetesen jó. Tényleg fantasztikus az az ötlet, amivel figurák, tokenek nélkül is pontosan meg lehet határozni, hogy ki, mi hol van a labirintusban. Viszont ennek átlátása nem egyszerű feladat, teljesen megértem, ha valakinek ebbe beletörik a bicskája, és katyvasznak érzi az egészet. Szívem szerint az ötlet miatt magasabb pontszámot adnék neki, de mivel eléggé korlátozott, hogy kinek az orra alá lehet ezt tolni, illetve a nyelvfüggetlenség bevállalása nem sikerült túl jól, így legyen ennyi.

While more portable than its older brother, there's something very tactile missing in this version.  It's not just the lack of cardboard stand-ups; it's also the abstraction of movement through rooms rather than the efficiency of navigation that came before.  It's an impressive design, technically, and still fun, but I know which I prefer.

RATING: 7
This game is not the type of game you think it is from the name.  It does have monsters but it is more of an abstract game in many ways since it has "chess-like" quality.  The Card Game has 25 monsters, which is great.  There is a lot of variety.  You lay out a random dungeon and you try to score victory points by killing opponents monsters or moving your monsters out of the other side of the dungeon.  The game is a puzzle and you have to think several moves ahead just like in chess.  AP prone players should stay away and it can run long because of that.  It may make sense to play with a time.  

The card game is only two player, and the card rotation system is clever.  But it really needs some colored stones, cubes or markers, to make it a little easier to see where things are on the card.

Great strategic/tactical card game for two. It has an enormous amount of replayability for less than 20€.

The card system is clever, but if this small version of dungeon twister would have small mini's or meeples and a better rule book, it could have been one of the best games of all time. 

As is: the rule book teaches the game step by step using different playable scenarios but does not provide an overview of all the rules in any way. Terrible idea! Had to create a decent rulebook myself

Holy ugly art!  The game is so gaudy I feel like it punches me in the face just looking at it.  I've not played it and I may not do so, I bounced off the rule book pretty hard.  I have no doubt there is a good game in here but the learning curve is too steep and I've heard it really requires repeated play to really grok it.  If I had a dedicated lunch time opponent like I did when I purchased it I might be more enthusiastic about getting this to the table but as of now it's likely trade fodder.

Not likely to play because I was at a convention learning the game in a demo by the designer and the designer was very rude, ignoring my friend and I when we asked questions about how to play and getting up and walking away from the table in the middle of teaching the game.  The game had potential but I won't try to play it again because of this.

RATING: 2
Horrid selection of mismatched, generic, ugly artwork, and a very uninspired theme. Most game mechanics, like the deterministic combat, are very basic and bland. Aside from that, the positioning mechanic is very clever, albeit difficult to follow in this particular implementation; with a more stylized, less-busy iconography it could work.

31-08-2014. Rated after 2-3 plays. I like Dungeon Twister a lot. You try to achieve certain objectives by using characters and rotating tiles to help you/screw your opponent. I like the boardgame a lot better than the cardgame though. While the cardgame severely downsizes the footprint of Dungeon Twister, the cardgame to me requires too much thought in finding out which card is where and which character can do what. I think a mini or standee like in the original game really work better than cards.

Like the board game, but a bit more confusing to visualize. Better action points system.

I need to give this one more of a chance. First couple of plays, the rules were a little confusing.

Fun lighter version of the board game. Keep track of where characters are on the ever moving cards can be daunting at time. I'm sure using some dice could fix this. It feels like you are competing in a puzzle. Lots of different characters that all break the game to keep it fresh.

Excellent 2-player game that somehow feels much less confrontational than many others. Just did tutorials so far, so rating might go up over time.

It is better than the original game. The portability make it even better. And the amount of characters included in the base game make the replayability huge.

Played just two times (introductory and next scenario). Not enough to judge. A bit too fiddly with the constant card flipping, rotating and imagining where your character and stuff is on the map.

RATING: 6
A bit abstract and hard to conceptualise due to it not being like any other game I've played and having it's own iconography and slightly quirky features. I never remember how to play and it feels like it should be a miniatures game rather than a card game. Never my first choice for a two player game - probably on the chopping block for the next cull.

Good game. Same mod of dungeon twister, but it's not the same thing...

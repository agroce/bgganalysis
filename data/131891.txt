Drafting and monster slaying.  This game can be brutal if you don't select cards wisely.  Still a lot of fun to break out on occasion.  Long term replayability will probably be lacking, and no news of expansions from Queen is disappointing.

A drafting game mechanically muddier but thematically richer than 7 Wonders. The game breaks down to 3 rounds, each with two phases. Each round you play a member of a stereo typical adventuring party who first gears up on equipment in the first phase which is executed draft style similar to 7 wonders. The second phase you enter level one of the quest and fight monsters in ancient ruins. Combat can be a little tricky as you pass on a monster and give it to another player only to find out you are worse or better off. While the party shares in the wealth of a defeated monster it is ideal to pick ones you can defeat in order to gain the most from the encounters. Each round takes you deeper into a dungeon and eventually a lost city. The gear gets better and the monsters get tougher. Some things to keep in mind is that early on you want to slay as many monsters as possible and obtain as much loot as possible because if you don't it can be hard to make up the lost lead. This is because if you are killed in a round during combat the rest of the party continues on until either everyone is taken out or all the monsters are defeated. This means they'll get more gold, xp, and be in a better position to draft better cards in subsequent rounds. The game is fun and I like it but there need to be more cards eventually or the game will start to feel a little stale.

1st play: Drafting games are not usually my forte but this one was cool.  The theme is fun and there is a nice progression from round 1 to round 3.  I need to play again as it's hard to evaluate which cards will be good on a first play.  The money splitting and monster passing is a little strange but not bad enough to ruin the game.

2nd play: The newness wore off pretty quickly on this one.  It could have been the table wasn't feeling it, but the game fell flat.  The passing monster mechanic is weird and can result in getting screwed.  I like the concept, and maybe with expansions it would be cooler (more card variety).

Just broken. Played a Demo at Essen, first player "died" at the first turn, we just ignored it but Then I died in the first round. Couldn't catch up but had a Good draft before the Second dungeon but couldn't Beat the Monster in One Turn, One health left and Lost it at another players Turn (Monster made 1damage to all players). We quitted the game immediately... Definately broken and I wanted to Love this game :(

A lot like 7 wonders but refines a bit with more variety as apposed to just making things "bigger" as the game progresses, but not different enough to actually scratch a different enough itch, plus the fact that this plays to a max of 5 and is longer to play makes it hard to justify if you already have a good card drafting game like 7 wonders.

You might like it if you like 7 wonders but are looking for something just a little bit deeper (and likely less "samey").

To comment this game, I need to quote one of my geekbuddies: "Lost Legends is doing for 7 Wonders exactly the same thing that Thunderstone did for Dominion, bringing an abstract game to life by simultaneously melding it with D&D dungeon-crawling tropes and giving the gameplay more subtlety."

The game is clearly an ambitious design, with lots of clever focus on risk management, but I feel it only partly achieved its goals. Perhaps some more development could've helped.

First of all, cards feel not completely balanced, and turn order could really mess with plans (if you play after a player controlling a cards that can "use" another player's card, things will certainly go wrong at some moment...).

Another source of problems lies in scoring: you receive bonus points for collecting sets of defeated monsters, but you hardly have any control on the types of monsters you will face.

Lastly, there are problems with the graphic design: cards have very small icons, and seeing what opponents can or cannot do is quite hard.

If it was a movie, I'd say the subject is great, but screenplay and acting are less than stellar...

After two plays, it is an okay game.  I had fun playing it even though I lost miserably.  The rulebook is horrible, and there are a lot of things that just are not clear. I can see that this game could get stale after a few more plays. If en expansion is released with updated rules and many more cards, I will most likely rate this higher.

A card drafting, fantasy based game? Yes, please! This is really a lot of fun. Draft weapons, armor, magic spells, items etc. to gear up for the baddies at the end of a level. I like how you can add killed enemies as skill points, giving your items cool new abilities. The game is brutal, however, in difficulty and in player interaction so be prepared! Fun stuff!

Played at Origins 2014 at Queens booth, rep was friendly and helpful and the experience led me to buy this game. There were a couple of rules snafus and as a warrior I got no real weapon until the second round!! but I did have a shield and a crossbow that I could plink away at the monsters with. There is a fair bit going on in this one to keep up with it has been deigned this way and for my tastes it works nicely. The din of the show floor, the lighting, temperature, ambiance (or lack thereof) all conspired to ruin the play for me (as it did on all the games played to be honest) but was unable to. even with a non-full play I had seen enough to know that this one has enough moving parts that I would like it. I purchased it after the play, the price was right, it came with expansions (promo character and alternate 1st level dungeon deck) so now it is here in the collection. the artwork is very good, as are the components. Others are speaking about an expansion, and form my point of view all good games cam make use of an expansion or two, it is my opinion that this one does not NEED one in order to be purchased. The adventure is large the dungeon is perilous the weapons are suitably pointy, I am looking forward to romps in the dungeons for real this next time and plan on doing so for quite some time.

Rating after missing noting a couple more plays on here. I like this game a lot, its got more potential than it seems to bring to the table, but that will come with support from Queen (hopefully) if not then it is what it is going to be. In this form there is a group I will always suggest this too for the foreseeable future and I am of the mind that I wont turn down a play of this if offered. its not quite an 8 for me so I went with the 7.75 as its more than a 7.5 would seem to indicate. I will revisit from time to time depending on if I can get some more plays in with a different group.

I was pretty excited to play this game again after my first play and went right out and bought it. Thereafter, each time I played it, I discovered that too many times new players without any experience with the game were crushed by monsters too quickly and ended up having to sit out the rest of the level with nothing to do, therefore unable to ever catch up in points. Not a fun experience. On the flip side, players who got to know the game got bored with the same cards quickly with the lack of variety in the same equipment cards being presented each game. Therefore, I am sadly rating this game much lower than I really want to because I can see the potential in this type of drafting card adventure.

Quite ok, but needs a second pass at the rules and then a FAQ upgrading the current rules (I don't expect them to send out replacement cards after a rebalance, but some sticker sets like the Catan card game had them would be cool).

The underlying idea is really good. 7 Wonders style item grabbing meshes well with thematic monster bashing, and the idea that you can have alternative monster decks make it quite replayable if more expansions release in the future.

However, the game is extremely unforgiving to someone not perfectly mowing through monsters, and both the item-process and the killing-process favour the player already ahead. As it is played in 3 rounds, this makes later rounds pointless~frustrating to players already behind, as they *know* they cannot keep up.

The core issue seems to be that there's just too much going on. In 7 Wonders, all you do is maximize your VP, you just have 10 ways of doing so. So losing out on a specific card isn't an instant loss. Here it's the opposite, plenty cards only exist once, and you need to get 3 types of offense, 3 types of defense, victory points are the ultimate goal, money, skills, everything. All while not having any second chances at anything at all.

Overall: Meh/10

The shopping part was the fun first part of the game where you drafted cards. The problem was too many bad cards and all the good ones seem to come at the same time when I didn't have the money to buy one. The second part of the game you go into the dungeon and get destroyed just like how your spaceship would get mauled in Galaxy Trucker. Except everybody dies. Person who manages to take out a few monsters before dying wins.

Beautiful artwork and I love the theme, but luck of the draw with the monster deck is overpowering.  Players that get pairs of monster types will simply outscore those that do not, and what monster types you fight is random -- especially in a 3-player game where half of the monster deck is not used.

I wish I could play this again, but it takes the right group of people to play it.  Those who enjoy board games, but aren't necessarily in-tune with "fantasy roll playing games" may find it daunting, as was the experience I had when I taught and played the first time.

It also took much longer than I originally expected, which contributed to the "not getting to the table often" factor.  The fact that it requires at least three to play also made it tough to hit the table.

Played at GenCon 2013.  I really wanted to like this game, and somewhere at its core is a good idea, but the execution is deeply flawed.  Lost Legends is subject to a runaway leader problem that was immediately obvious on our first play.  Repeated plays did not improve the outcome or reveal a mitigating pathway.  The game is not playable or enjoyable without substantial rework.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pretty decent alternative to other card drafting games like 7 Wonders, though there are definite balancing and runaway leader issues. The unique twist with Lost Legends is the addition of a 'monster battling' phase after each draft, where your current card build is put to the test against VP-monsters with various strenghs and weaknesses.

A great mix of 7 wonders and thunderstone.
Pros: The game is quite deep (twice as deep as 7 wonders when you consider the combat phase) without being overly complicated (thanks in part to the well-thought iconography that helps smooth out the gameplay.)
The artwork is also one of the best I've seen for this genre.
Cons: The first (5p) game went on for more than 4 hours. Even though it was 1h30am in the end, nobody was sick of playing, so I guess it shows how much the game was appreciated though. The game could have a little more interaction between players. I'm worried having played a few times and knowing whats coming gives a huge advantage against newbie players.

RATING: 7.5
I *really* like this game a lot...the 7.5 rating reflects it's conditional usage. So let's get the negatives out of the way:

- Can have a real punishing run-away loser problem, making it quite difficult to catch up.
- Rewards experienced players, so not something to mix with beginners and veterans. 
- Never caught on enough to warrant much in the way of expansions -- just a couple mini ones -- and it could really use more monsters and items.

And yet it's the perfect game for some like myself that is always rotating through a different game every week: I have a large, personal collection that's ever increasing in size, and part of a game group that is equally guilty. Meaning, I'll never get the chance to play it to death and have it wear out its welcome. I really find the draft portion full of interesting decisions and the ability to pass off a monster along to someone else at the right time who is ill-equipped to deal the new threat is oh so very satisfying. I think I like it best with three, but perhaps I'm still too inexperienced to deal with higher player counts.

I can see why this might not be everyone's preferred kind of game, but the vocal critics who claim it's a broken design are wrong and unfair. Granted, it might not have lived up to the full-price-paid expectations when it was first Kickstarted, but it sure has been a joyful addition to my collection for just $20.

Aside from having too less cards for good replayability, it is a solid, but brutal card drafting and fighting game, that will test and hone your skills.

Though the balance is not perfect, check it out, if You are either into card drafting, fantasy or brutal games.

Hazel Halliday said exactly my experience with my play: "Too long and very unbalanced. Most disadvantaged player from one round goes first in the next round, with no ability to side step the monster they have been randomly dealt. If they can't defeat it, they die and that is the end of their participation for the entire round. Very frustrating. Will not be playing again." 

I picked a charachter with two health (i.e. one foot in the grave) died in second round, and went first in third round with three bucks. I couldnt buy anything useful for my situation (monster was immune to all my current weapons, and I only had a tatered robe of noob for armor) for two draft passes. finally got a weapon that could hit (not kill) the badie. too little too late...died in first turn of round three. sat for another half hour having fun* for the rest of the game. 
Art work is nice so Ill not give it a 1

Lost Legends has a certain amount of fun factor, and I will say I enjoy the core design and system, but it's WAY too easy for players to have turns where they can't do jack snack when it comes time to battle monsters. It needs some balance tweaking to make it worth playing. As it is, it's definitely something I think people should play a couple of times, but until/when/if it gets a balance pass or three it's not something I'll be interested in playing again.

Another in the "cards with lots of miniscule print that you have no chance of being able to read from across the table" genre.  However, the art is very nice, and the game play sort of works (having someone with the same hero sitting to your right, as I did, can be annoying, but I'm sure that with skill you would learn to overcome this handicap, at least to some extent.)

This is certainly miles better than Star Trek Deck Building Game: The Next Generation.

A good game out of the box but requires some house ruling to really make it shine.  Player elimination is an issue and the penalty for loosing out and dying should not be boredom, therefore we integrated a rule allowing the player to return on the next round with a damage token applied to the character.  This token represents -3 victory points at the end of the game.

Also, starting in the second round monster drafting is introduced allow the weakest player to choose an adversary.

Very swingy game, you never know if things are going to work your way or not. It also seems to suffer from positive feedback loops.

Still fun to play though, mostly because I'm a sucker for the theme.

Best with 3, still good with 4, too long with 5 players.

A little 7 Wonders card drafting for equipment, a pinch of Cutthroat Caverns and some interesting decisions to make (do i fight the monster in front of me, or take mystery meat, then do I pass that monster on that will hopefully kill my party member or do I fight it and get the glory and hope it can't kill me. Do I buy the equipment or do I convert the card into a skill to get discounts and maybe do some more damage but you can lose skills. The pacing is much better then Mike Elliott's Thunderstone. I played it twice in one night and enjoyed it both times, not many games I can do that with. If you are killed you lose 1 skill and can't kill more monsters that round but you still collect gold and your back the next round at full HP and Mana.

Really wanted to like this game. Love 7 Wonders, and have been looking for more games that use that drafting mechanic. Thought this one might be a good fit, but it has too many problems.

Luck seems to be far more important than strategy. You can have a good strategy, but if the cards don't show up then you are screwed. This happens both in the draft and with the monster decks.

Certainly has similarities to 7 Wonders - drafting over 3 rounds, building a tableau w cards, but the game feel is quite different, with the bash the monsters segment adding quite a bit of randomness.  Would be better at 7 Wonders length.  First player can be disadvantaged as cannot evade the monster in front of them, and the weakest player gets to start each time.  Card icons small so difficult to see what neighbours have.  Can see expansions adding to the richness of the game, but not sure about replayability.

It's takes a bit to get through the rules and I wonder if they could have been organized a little better. The artwork and overall presentation is amazing. These are easily the nicest looking character boards I've ever seen in a game.

As for the game, it is one part Gearing Up to take on 3 levels of monsters via card drafting similar to 7 Wonders and one part taking on the onslaught of beasts. The theme matches well with the mechanics. There is definitely some excitement as you get better stuff and skills, but there is always a little dread as you know that the monsters are getting more powerful as well.

Fun game, not too deep, subject to luck of the draw, but who cares, it is part of the fun.

Terrible game, extremely luck-driven, unbalanced, too fiddly and too long. The players are faced with uninteresting and mostly uninformed decisions while squinting to decipher tiny icons on the cards.

There is too little variety in monsters and there isn't much choice in which ones to fight. Often you have no choice, when they are passed by other players. That's pretty bad, because either you can defeat the monster or you can't. That is, the only part of the game that would actually benefit from a bit of randomness has none.

Also, there is a serious rich-gets-richer problem, and if you fall behind - which may happen purely by bad luck in the first round - it seems impossible to catch up. It's annoyingly easy to be defeated by monsters, having to sit out for the rest of the round. In my only game, all five players were defeated in the second round, and then all but one in the third.

What is most sad is that there might be a good game under the pile of garbage, but it needed a lot more development. I could only stand playing this because I'm a Fantasy fan and liked most of the art, but it was still painful.

Lost Legends is to Fairy Tale (and the execrable 7 Wonders to a lesser extent, as well) as Thunderstone is to Dominion. For me, that's high praise. It's drafting with a purpose--you know what you're fighting, and so gone is some of the random screwage that drafting games sometimes fall into.
I like it a lot. Time will tell if it's got legs.

RATING: 2.5
All about luck, from drafting to fighting monsters, rich gets richer, no interaction, rules don't cover everything and there are still other things I dislike, all in a single game, wow...

It's more about finding a monster that can't hurt you and fight it aslong as you can, while everyone else around you dies. Once you are alone, all treasures are yours plus all you got from the others before. Not broken, but very bad.

I really wonder how and why this game has a rating of around 6.5.

Played at Essen.  Too long and very unbalanced.  Most disadvantaged player from one round goes first in the next round, with no ability to side step the monster they have been randomly dealt.  If they can't defeat it, they die and that is the end of their participation for the entire round.  Very frustrating.  Will not be playing again.

Had the potential to be great, after one play through, however, every one at the table knew it would lose it's luster in only a handful of plays. The base game doesn't come with enough variety in monster/equipment/heroes to justify it's price. I grew bored by the third act/round. It really pisses me off cause I love drafting games and really the only ones that are worth mentioning nowadays are Among the Stars and 7 Wonders(Drafting games where "drafting" is the MAIN mechanic of the game)

The game will grow stale very fast, and with no expansion in sight, it goes straight to the trade pile. Very sad, cause the game's design and mechanics are great. The rating is low, due to the fact that there is potential here and it's a shame and it wasn't tapped into. Very sad

First played December 31st, 2013.  This takes too long to learn and play for the fun factor.  Once you have learned it, the subsequent plays should be better.  I was fortunate enough to have someone explain and then guide us through the game though, so there is larger investment to be the initial read instructions guy.  It's my understanding that this is a simplified version of D&D. Each person has a personal scoring track with health, mana and victory points. You choose a character at the beginning and each has different attributes. You get 6 cards to build up your character. These cards can be a weapon, defense, book or amulet. You pay for these or you can choose to make it a skill to help reduce cost for future purchases or be able to use a card in a fight later. You pick one card and pass the rest to your neighbor while keeping 5 of 6 cards. You play 3 rounds and attack a set of monsters after drawing 5 cards (as above) each round. If you die you sit out the rest of the round but come in the next round.

It could be far better game but still its mechanics doesnt seem proper.

Although i like Lost Legends and think it is better than Seven Wonders, why its drafting has meaning and part of the game perfectly. It is not just a drafting game and delivers much more enjoyment.

And dont play it with five. Downtime would kill you. 3-4 players excel the gameplay.

Monster hunting game by card drafting. The game is very unbalanced. Items and skills are unbalanced. Monsters are very unbalanced, too. Moreover, event happening is also imbalance.

RATING: 4
Demo copy brought to Madison Board Gamers, and we played one round with 5 players.

The drafting phase was enjoyable. With 5 people and 5 draftable cards, you don't have any idea what's coming to you in later drafts (similar to a large-group 7 Wonders), and this can easily stick you in a bad position.

At five monsters per person, the combat phase drags out way longer than it needs to, especially with five people.
It doesn't help that it's rather fiddly - take experience, pass money to all your neighbors, collect a champion trophy, etc.

The game seems to be balanced so that you can't usually one-shot a monster, but if you don't, you easily take two or three damage. Most characters start with 3 or fewer HP, so you can be one-shot as easily as the monsters. The board goes up to 9 HP and/or mana, but I don't think anyone in our group got over 5 on either track. In the last phase, the monsters have 10+ HP, but I didn't see a lot of ways to reliably generate more than 6 damage in one turn - assuming they weren't immune. We generally felt overpowered and outmatched. The one benefit of 5 players is that it's very easy to find someone without a monster to pass yours off to, which we did a lot to avoid certain death.

The crowning glory was when we opened the last combat round with four of the five players having the same monster on the table. This monster dealt 1 damage to any player who defeated a monster, meaning the first player to defeat a monster would have to eat 3 or 4 damage and either die or be on the brink of death.

I think this would be better with 3 players than 5, and while I'd play it again, I wouldn't seek it out.

A shot at mixing an ameritrash-y fantasy stuff with euro-optimization.  The first prevails anyway.

Clean, good rules, but the fun factor is moderate.  Still, it would've been a '6', hadn't it been for two issues:
- no control - you can get non-fitting monsters to fight with and then you are unable to keep up with others with claiming the awards.  There is _some_ room for manoeuvre, but it's not big enough and not controllable enough.
- snowball effect - those who kill the initial required combinations of monsters get rewards which allow for another awards.  Those who can't get those initial rewards quickly enough fall back and that's unrecoverable.

First impression: This is a pretty cool card drafting game. It definitely owes a nod to 7 Wonders, but it's also very much its own thing.

Look around for some of the criticisms before buying.

The card drafting mechanic works really well with the fantasy theme. You build a character one weapon/spell/skill at a time to take on the nasty monsters. At its heart the game is about efficiency. You want to lay waste to monsters in as few turns as possible so that you face and defeat more then your opponents. There is a bit of set collection to add wrinkles to your preferences. 

I like the game quite a bit. Having burned out on 7 Wonders this is a refreshing reimplementation of its core mechanic. There are a few minor quibbles, some of the wording is vague, a couple cards feature negative player interaction, but on the whole I enjoy the game a lot.

Only prototype play of first level of three at Spiel 2012 but no desire to ever play again if there wasn't either a serious mistake in the rules explanations (don't think so) or the game is completey overhauled before release. The 7 Wonders mechanism just doesn't work if you're not flexible in choosing a different strategy based on the cards you get in the drafts. Two out of four players were left with completely not working heroes for the battle phase as preceding warriors/wizards drew the interesting cards out of the deck. As a result the remaining players were left with more monsters they couldn't cope with after these two players died. Wow, player elimination!

It's way way too long for the enjoyment it gives.
It's way way too repetitive.  You've seen everything after just 1 play and even during your first play turn to turn it just feels like going through the motions.
It's way way too random.  You'll often loose by a few points that had little to do with what you did or didn't accomplish vs. what monsters happened to be drawn. Don't care for the scoring system in this game at all.
It's way too often that a player gets eliminated and sits and watches.
It's odd and anti-thematic in so many ways.  Even the character and item progression are really unsatisfying.
In the end the only thing mildly entertaining is the drafting portion trying to setup your character and convert skills etc.  Everything else is a boring mess.
There are so many better Fantasy themed Euros or Dungeon Crawlers or Fantasy anything that with as many different games as I've played I have ZERO desire to ever play this one again.
The iconography in this one didn't really bother me (and I don't tend to like iconography in games).  The rulebook definitely could have been better but It didn't seem as bad as some others have stated.
The artwork is beautiful all around though. I really like that part.

The game is good, I have noticed some problems in the monster "pass to another player" mechanics and the lack of variety of card effects that influences your neighbor or give you benefits from them. But, I believe with just one expansion and all this can be solved. The mechanics are cool and we always have a good time playing.

Demoed at BGG.CON 2012.  I liked it!  I'm excited to receive it once the Kickstarters ship.

08-07-2013 - Bumped down from 8 to 7.  Played last night, and although I did enjoy it, it's just not the most oomph I've ever experienced in a game before.  In theory I love it- building my character, managing life and mana, casting spells, gathering weapons, etc.  But in execution it's just not that great.  You can only get what you can afford, which might not be much depending on what OTHER players do (you don't collect all your gold winnings, which cuts both ways, but I digress).  You can't heal yourself easily unless you were able to draft a card - and buy it - during a round, and even if you do have the ability you can only do it once (can't re-charge it without ANOTHER card that you may or may not have).  Ultimately it's all about getting the best cards you can and then playing them each once until you're inevitably dead.  Kind of meh.  We'll see how it goes....

I enjoyed this one after initially having a bad first impression after a deadly first round.  One comment - make sure to draft armor in the first round!  It is a bit fiddly but plays relatively simply.  The opportunity to pass monsters creates an interesting dynamic.  Diversity in weapon skills will likely prove helpful.

Some of the mechanics I really do like. You do have choices to make, and of course you can lose because of a mistake... but if you win or not depends a lot on luck. You just have way too less influece on the monster types you fight for how much victory points the sets are worth. This kills a lot of the fun for me.

Only played once and don't feel qualified to give this a rating yet. None of the mechanics feel all that interesting and the game as a whole was perhaps underwhelming, but I did enjoy it. It gives you that dungeon crawl feeling of gearing up, leveling up, and attacking the monster. Plus each member of your party (no, it's not cooperative) has strengths and weaknesses against different types of monsters. Haven't figured out the strategy to maximize points via challenge trophy shuffling.

Played several more times. I do sort of like it but whenever I suggest it, it is to introduce it to someone I think will be taken in by the theme or play, not because I want to play it.

Traded for Key Harvest in Gamex math trade May 2014.

The drafting element is an interesting turn for this game and the artwork and quality are very nice. The difficulty is very much dependent on the player. If you can make good choices with the drafting and equipping of your character, then the fights are easier. This is one game where specialization is not a good thing. 
The lack of variety in the characters would be my one negative about this game. Each character is a cookie cutter of the others, but with one stat a point less than the average and one stat a point higher. Tagging on some house rules would make character selection and play strategy a much more entertaining experience.

Pros:

Drafting and dungeon crawling game. Equipping items and fighting monsters is fun, especially through drafting, great artwork.

Cons:

Card design and iconography is un-intuitive and confusing, cards and board take up a lot of space, boredom between turns especially when people AP, not all cards are as useful as others for battle so drafting can make the game unbalanced at times.

Note - so far only played this with 3 players. All comments are in light of that. 

The scoring system has some issues. If a player gets ahead early they more or less automatically win. In addition there is a good bit of luck involved in the order of monsters appearing and what appears for you vs. your opponents.

The drafting => fighting element is cool however it also could use some more cards to make the drafting a bit more "intense". After playing a few times you know what card to pick over all others almost every time.

We also found gaining skills to provide little value and with 3 players we died in every round. This caused us to lose a skill while one player never got skills and he just killed all the monsters. Even in the 3rd round, having skills help reduce the gold a lot but just killing monsters is so much more beneficial.

It’s a very mathy card-based dungeon crawler, more mathy than Thunderstone maybe, and by the same designer Mike Elliott, though it’s perhaps less intuitive and a little more complex than TS.  As always, familiarity with the cards helps, and as with Thunderstone I’m not a big fan of the level of abstraction, though you don’t quite have that whole TS situation where a dagger, a torch and an iron ration go wandering into a dungeon.  Great art, nice game, just don't feel the need to add this to my collection as it's a bit too abstract for me personally.  This has nothing to do with James kicking our butts again either…

Terrible game: the draft mechanism made one player to go without weapons, which made him die with his very first monster. He got very little money which made it worse on the second draft, and died again on first monster of second delve. We stopped there, but clearly the same would have happened on the third delve.

It fell flat because of its artificial rules to "balance" things: How come I defeat a dragon and get as much gold as with a simple skeleton? Also, since you stop when the deck is empty, the best situation is when other 3 players are dead and they watch you play alone.

No interaction between players, pasted theme, pricey, ...a game to stay away from

RATING: 3
Lost Legends is half a decent game. The part of the game where players draft equipment cards to gear up for adventure is enjoyable and builds anticipation of whatever quest you are about to embark on.

Unfortunately, what you do once equipped is a let down. The 'quest' is nothing more than a series of one-on-one fights with monster cards. Difficulty is high if improperly equipped, with many players likely dying and having to wait for the others to either complete the quest or die as well.

Whether victory or failure results, the name of the game is stat-tracking, and for what? Do 2 more 'quests' and then add up your Legend points to determine a winner. Snore.

8/17 Played with three, and we all liked it a great deal. People complain about chaos/randomness, but to be honest, that's what the nature of adventuring is. You make choices for your equipment a la 7 Wonders, so your drafting means something. The randomness occurs during the monster phase, and honestly, there's ample opportunity to make strategic choices dependent on when you fall in the turn and how successful your opponents are.

I think that most throw entropy under the bus when, in fact, the truth of the matter is spreading themselves too thin or made poor drafting choices.

I won the game even while dying halfway through the second adventure. That says something about your choices counterbalancing luck. Immersing yourself in the theme helps a lot. 

An excellent game, albeit a game that doesn't reward players for just being at the table.

It almost works as a light dungeon crawl, but there's too much luck in what sorts of monsters you face. Some sort of bidding / drafting system could fix that though.

Wow, after thinking I knew how to play this one, it took forever to get going with all the rules re-reading, questions, and clarifications during our first try. I also lost horribly (5 players) - if you die early, you miss out on everything and are even further back when the next round starts (on round 2 I died on the first turn). I did enjoy the game for the most part though ... hopefully all goes well the next try!

There are several problems in this game which are pretty big IMO.  You can have no chances to draft equipment and be completely unable to fight.  The cards are not balanced.  Some strong, difficult monsters to take down have the same reward as monsters that are much easier to kill.  Your success in the game is dependent on your neighbors, not just in what you draft, but also in who is able to give you gold with their kills.  Also, there is alot of randomness in the way the monsters come out.  Overall I did not enjoy it, and think that there are better options for card drafting games.

Get rid of the whole movement sideshow, let's cut straight to the chase. Killing monsters. Do a Fairy Tale round to acquire 5 cards (passing hands from player to player, take 1 card each time), choosing weapons, armor and boosters. Then beat up the monster allocated to you. Usually you can't beat it first turn unless you tap a booster, in which case your armor might protect you some from its attack. Anyway, you'll likely kill it next time before it attacks again, in which case draw another monster and do the same again. You're expected to kill 3 or so monsters a round (earning you gold and XP), and some monsters are more / less likely to be hit by various weapon types, so you want a couple of different types of weapons, boosters in each to cope with multiple attacks, and armor ... and of course you can't get them all. So the decision points are traditional Fairy Tale ... what card do I take given what might come in the next hand. The decisions in combat are when to use a booster or not. Other than that, just play it out, with some cheer/groan factor in the next monster you draw (and whether you can hive it off to another player who's currently monster-less). You play out three rounds. The latter rounds allow you to amp up to cope with amp'd up monsters, meaning it plays out about the same. I'm not a fan of rounds where you're effectively playing the same game 3 times, and that's the case here despite the attempt to disguise that by amping it up. So all the normal dungeon beatup tropes are here and as a result the game inevitably succeeds in what it's trying to do in providing a card only whackfest that simulates your normal dungeon whackfest. Without a board it loses a sense a epicness and thematic inveigling which causes a rating drop, but the mechanics are sound and decent for the occasional play.

Played the first time in Essen after I got it there. First game was awful because we got the rules wrong, this because (never expected this from queen games) the rules are badly written. Second game was better but only after the third game (when I was back home) did I really enjoy the game. Drafting is good fun and it got even better once I realized some of the things you could do with certain cards.

Very nice illustrations. I like this game now and I'm glad, for I was worried it didn't stand up to the expectations I had.

Not sure how I feel about this game. I liked the theme, the mechanics and generally how it played. I didn't like that you could get knocked out of the round so easily. It seemed like one or two hits from a creature and you're basically dead.

I feel like you can get better at it though and our first game we drafted pretty poorly. I have a feeling the rating is either going to stay put or drop another 1 or 2 points depending on how the next few games go.

This is the second game I play of Mike Elliott. The first was Thunderstone (with some expansions and also Thunderstone Advance). I really enjoy Thunderstone, but have 1 big issue with the game: the playing time. More often then not the combination of cards will make that the game is sort of stuck. What Thunderstone misses is streamlined gameplay.

I have exactly the same issue with Lost Legends. The first part, the 7 Wonders-drafting of equipment is just fine. But then comes the combat with monsters and then this go awefully wrong. 
My main issue is the getting of monsters. Why make things so complicated: look at the monster, study if you can defeat it, if not pass it to an opponent IF someone has a free slot for a monster. Then study the central monster, see if you can defeat it. If not, draw a monster from the deck. Again study it. If you don't like it, again give it to an opponent IF there is one with an open slot. And finally draw a new monster and hope you have won the lottery (by whom I mean you finally get a monster you can defeat). This is not only hard to explain, it makes thing drag on far too long!

Too long for what's offered, though this may be due to playing with 4.  Lower player counts may alleviate this, but the stated 70 minutes would still be too long in my opinion.

Feels like 7 Wonders meets Munchkin.  Each round begins with a draft of equipment cards to help you fight the coming monsters.  After cards have been drafted, monsters start appearing.  Monsters can be passed off on other players who don't already have a monster to fight, but you're ultimately at the mercy of a random draw for monster cards.  This leads to situations where you may find it difficult to collect point tiles because you didn't draw the right kind of monster, or you had an inconvenient monster dropped in your lap that you can't get rid of.

Ultimately, the game has far too many random factors to support any claims of strategy.  Tactics and luck abound here.

Fun game that, frankly, probably deserves more recognition, but I think the name is holding it back.  "Lost Legends" conveys almost nothing about the game, and makes it sound like yet-another generic fantasy card game...which it is anything but.  It's a cool mix between 7 Wonders and Thunderstone with really strong components, with the attendant fiddly scoring and interesting pursuit of l33t l3wt. 
Overall, a game that could use an expansion or two before it would see its true potential, but another strong entry from Mike Elliott.

This is the highest rating I can give this game until the rules issues are worked out. The current rulebook doesn't match the text on the cards and I have a strong feeling a handful are misprinted. Clearly the playtesters and the rulebook writer were never on the same page.

That being said, this has a lot of potential. If Queen will step up and fix the mistakes I would definitely give it my support.

There seems to be a good game lurking here, but...
(a) The rulebook looks ok at first, but upon closer inspection has lots of ambiguities, inconsistencies, and out-right typos.
(b) The luck, runaway leader, and bland characters all detract from the experience.

The engine appears solid, with a few minor caveats.  So, with a better rulebook and more interesting set of cards, I think the game would be fantastic.  Sadly, that is not how the game is.

15-06-2014. Game was a gift from my Secret Santa 2013. Rated after 2 plays. I like Lost Legends, but I notice that I do not feel much need to play the game. If given the chance, I will favor 7 Wonders or Among the Stars (which I also own). Therefore, I probably will want to get rid of the game.

In lost legends you play an adventure going down in the dungeon. You draft 3 rounds of equipment, and after each round you fight a bunch of monsters until you're killed. You get points/resources for each killed monster and get money that you can spend on getting better gear.

My experience is that the game suffers from runaway leaders and if you fail in round 1 you'll be effectively eliminated. I am not sure if I am current in this hunch, but given how our games played out leads me to expect this particular problem.

Expect to fare badly the first couple of times you play this. Many people have been turned off by being defeated quickly in the combat rounds. But it takes some trial and error to understand what it takes to survive the combat round--after a few plays, I almost never die during the combat phase. In my experience, it's crucial to first secure some kind of weapon that will work on your first monster before all else. Once you've secured a usable weapon (and perhaps a useful spell), only then start worrying about defense and lastly a second weapon. Being able to kill a monster in a single attack is a huge advantage, and always something to shoot for. When you play with people who all know how to draft properly, the game becomes very tight and competitive. I think the game deserves a better rating than it gets

Initial impression after a 2p play: Plusses - Game play: plenty of decisions to make, even if they aren't always deep ones; if someone gets far enough ahead and someone else is far enough behind, then there are no real catch-up mechanisms: boo-hoo. Personally, I found the game still to be fun in an agonising way when trailing in the dirt and tackling the L3 monsters with L1 weapons. Edit after 3 further 'proper' plays with 4 and 3 players: All this still holds. Have had one game with tense scoring and a close finish, and enjoyed another game where I played utterly hopelessly but still had a great time. 

Production: the art is atmospheric, and there's a bit of consistency, eg in the way magic effects are portrayed (with glowing magical symbols, much as in numerous fantasy PC games but rarely seen in fantasy art - I kind of liked this). Card stock is great, and the cardboard used for the chips and player boards is solid German quality. The box is one of the sturdier ones I've come across too, and the insert's dividers are useful and look nice too. Plenty of room for expansion cards, neatly stored. Edit: All still good. Wish they'd gone for more differentiation on card backs for equipment and monsters, would make it easier to organise (not a huge problem though).

Doubts, minuses: 
Game play: Is it a bit long, for what it is? May become a slog, but I actually thought the game length was reasonable, just that there are some quicker filler games that might have more depth. It isn't long, though. Edit: I'm not finding it long, and am certain play would usually be comfortably under an hour with a little experience - for me that's filler territory. I think the pacing of the game is just right: doubt alleviated!
Might it be dependent on expansions for variety? I will compare here to 7 Wonders, which I like, but has the similar issue that you draft through every card, every game. You don't necesssarily go through every monster, so you can't count on knowing exactly what you'll have to face, but because there are multiples of each monster type, you'll soon have seen them all. To go back to 7 Wonders, i've been happy to have some 21 plays without feeling the need to buy the expansions, even though the game lacks variety - if Lost Legions matches that I'd say it's a minor issue at worst. 
The strong get stronger and the weak get stomped: As remarked earlier, boo-hoo. Does every game have to have catch-up mechanisms that effectively penalise the leader to keep the game artificially close? The question is whether the game is still fun to play if losing. Personally, after getting stomped in one play I still enjoyed it - but will this continue to be the case? Will have to see. (Edit: still enjoying getting stomped after 4 plays...)

Component issues: As with 7 Wonders (or even more so in this case), quite a price tag for a fairly small pool of cards. I would say that as with 7 Wonders, if the game is good enough, this is a non-issue. 
The cover art is a bit disappointing compared to the quality of the art in the game. Better than many other games, and miniscule as an issue for me.

Verdict: Yet to see, but promising after some initial doubts. It is damn weird to see Queen take on the Fantasy card game genre, though. Damn weird!

I like some of the ideas that went into this game, but the overall experience leaves something to be desired. Particularly at higher player counts, combat drags. They really needed to come up with a simultaneous action selection system to resolve combat so that it could flow as smoothly as the drafting. 

The drafting had some problems as well. The later cards were incredibly expensive, and we ended up playing most of the cards from the final round as skills because we couldn't afford many cards. I think the skill system could be improved, but the card drafting is certainly more functional than the combat system.

My initial thoughts...

I think BGG has this one spot-on.  It's a 6-6.5.  There's a a fair amount to like:
1.  Drafting weapons/items to kill monsters in a dungeon is a clever idea.
2.  The artwork is evocative.
3.  Some of the combos are satisfying.

But the cons, for me, are glaring:
1.  Blatant errors in the rulebook/cards/card reference.  
2.  Annoying fiddliness when placing cards next to and underneath your player board, and moving small cubes on your player board.
3.  Odd, and possibly, unnecessarily rules complexity.  For example, rules governing the selection of monsters (and when/how you can "pass" them to other players).  I suspect with more development, some of the fat could have been cut from this game making it a much more attractive gateway-level game.  As it is now, it's a gamer's game.
4.  Scoring is fiddly.  This is a game that would really benefit from having only 1 way to score points and keeping things very streamlined.  Instead, you end up busting out the calculator at the end to see who won.
5.  Perhaps most damning - I'm not sure there's much satisfaction in actually killing monsters and gathering points.  There's very little tension, no narrative to get you immersed, your character lacks any personality, etc.  It's a very mechanical game - which is maybe going to be fine with some players, but for this theme, I find it to be a disconnect.  This is the same reason why deck-builders (like Thunderstone) tend to bounce off me.  I don't really get a sense of excitement - I'm just pushing numbers around to earn numbers.

Retail version. Played it for the first time yesterday (Nov. 1, '16). Included rulebook is a bit of a mess, it resembles more of a reference document than a comprehensive set of rules.

My opinion at the moment? Too much "book keeping" for a simple deterministic combat  system. 

Maybe I'll enjoy it more along the run of a few more plays, but for now I can't even bring it up to a 6. It's somewhat entertaining, but it misses something. Maybe some homebrew rules to offset some minor drawbacks of the game.

A Thunderstone alkotója deckbuild nélkül is elkészítette a játékát. Draftolással szerzünk fegyvereket, pajzsokat, varázslatokat és egyéb kiegészítőket, majd nekiindulunk a szörnyeknek. 3 kör a játék, ami pont elég. Kiesni nem lehet, de a halál az első körben alaposan visszavetheti a kalandozót, ezt kompenzálandó a szörnyek legyőzésekor az ellenfeleinknek is csurran cseppen némi pénz, ami a tárgyak vásárlásához szükséges. A játék a maga kategóriájában jól működik, egyedül az újrajátszhatóságát érzem kicsinek, mert nincs olyan rengeteg kártya és a kalandozók közt sincs lényegi különbség igazán. Ettől függetlenül kellemes élmény volt.

It's a bit long for what it is. I like that the premise is that you have a character that gets progressively more powerful over the course of the game and has different abilities to take on different types of creatures. But the game can drag with many players, and the sharing of money - while a necessary balancing mechanism - feels forced. I think it might have been better to present this as a monster exhibition, where you all face a variety of creatures and then earn fame for defeating them (victory points), but the more fame you earn, the more money it costs you (as you have to spend a bunch of money to live the extravagant lifestyle).

This is a great game that I wish was getting more buzz because I think it needs expansions to continue being a great game.

The game takes place across 3 rounds and each round has 2 phases.  First is a 7 Wonders style drafting phase where you equip your characters.  Next is a combat phase where players battle 1 or more monsters.

The drafting phase, as counter-intuitive as it may sound, was the more fun part for me.  You get a hand of cards, take one to equip your character with or sell it for a skill symbol and some money, and pass the remaining cards to your neighbor.  The equipment all costs money but is reduced based on skill symbols you have, each characters starts the game with 2.  You are limited with how much equipment you can have of different types (weapons, armor, spells, and accessories) and your other option is to sell the equipment and also get an additional symbol to give you discounts and ability to activate other cards in future rounds.  Each round the equipment gets better and the monsters get tougher.

Then the combat round is simply players taking turns attacking and being attacked by monsters until one of the two is dead.  This was one of only two small problems I had with the game.  This phase can take a little too long and while I feel the game plays better with more players, the more players you have the longer this phase will take.  Each player only does one combat round, one at a time, and waits for all other players to do theirs before they can go again.  And the way the trophies pass around, some global effects on monsters and equipment, and gold is shared you can't really do combat simultaneously to speed things up.  You would have to take more time figuring out the order of things than you would save doing things that way.

The other gripe I have with the game is there is no real player interaction.  It is a bit of a simultaneous solitaire experience minus some minor things like drafting a card to deny it of your opponent or a couple special pieces of equipment that let you use their stuff.  Some players in my group were suggesting house rules to add more interaction but I'm, most of the time, against house ruling games.  From a completely superficial standpoint, I'm not getting paid to fix a designer's game.  From a more logical standpoint, too often house ruling a game to "fix" it will introduce other problems so you don't actually end up making any progress.

In the end what matters is the game felt original and I had a lot of fun with it.  It is a theme I enjoy, like a kinder Cutthroat Caverns.  I do think that it has a short shelf life as you see all the same equipment and monsters every play through.  Even in 1 play I was wishing for more variety.  There's enough game play here to look past that for a while but not too long.  Unfortunately, being ranked close to 2000 here and seeing it go on clearance sale everywhere and hearing nobody talk about it convinces me expansions aren't really in the cards for this one.  That makes me sad.

Does for 7 Wonders what Thunderstone did for Dominion.  Ironically I prefer Dominion over Thunderstone but this is head and shoulders above 7 wonders.  The added combat phase after the drafting phase makes this game really fun.  The art needs a special call out too.  Amazing.

Edit: after a few plays I have seen that this game really doesn't have legs.  There is very little variety in the gearing phase which leads to a lack of variety in the combat phase.  This one really needs an expansion.

Poorly laid out and edited rules.  Inconsistent card verbage and poor layout.  Inconsistent play.  And way too long (partially because of card and rule issues).

The description of the game on BGG describes this game as a streamlined euro with a drafting mechanism. And a drafting game it is. But it also slaps a combat phase on top of that. Unfortunately that phase doesn't feel like a streamlined euro at all. It felt more like the combat phase in [thing=17223][/thing]. You have quite some cards with each their own modifier as you have to go over them one by one. Oh, and this one grants me this.. oh, this one grants me that. And so on. It felt quite cumbersome and not streamlined at all. And not very exciting. But what bothered me most was the luck factor in what monsters come up. That can really make or break your chances of winning.

Initial rating: 5.8

There are a lot of problems with this game. The distribution of weapons seems off. Pass up the first weapon you see in the draft and you may not every get another one. At that point, you're not really drafting cards, you're scrabbling for any shit you can lay your hands on.

With 5, you'll only see each pile of cards once, so if there are 2 things you need; tough luck. There doesn't seem to be another.

Did the person to your right do badly? Shame. You'll die poor in the next round. And if you do; death spiral!

If you build your character to be anything other than fairly well rounded, your chances are entirely random. One player built a melee/ranged attack character and drew a monster immune to both. One player couldn't harm trolls whereas the troll couldn't harm me. It nearly killed him and is no threat to me at all. The passing of monsters only works if people can and do kill their stuff off. In the troll example above, why should I kill him? I can just hold him off until everyone else is dead and then I get a free run at everything in the pile.

The elven helmet is clearly overpowered. Ooh, free protection from chaos damage? That'll save me about 8 hit points.

And yet, oddly, I quite enjoyed the game. It's an hour or two of randomness and yet another example of how good 7 Wonders actually is. There's no theme/text/character names/story so it clearly isn't aimed at the AT crowd, but is really too random for the Euro crowd. How good is it as a game? It might be a 1 or a 2. How much 'fun' was it? Perhaps a 6 or so.

What do folios do when added as skills?!

Overall, I liked Lost Legends. I love the drafting (and paying for) abilities as the method for building your character. The battles are kinda fun. The rules about which monsters you can engage (or leave in the middle of the table or pawn off on another character) were a bit opaque and fiddly, and the rules about distributing gold to other players after killing a monster were downright stupid in a three player game (kill a monster that gives three coins and each player receives one of them is the best example of this pointless mechanic). Some good, some bad, some in-between, but the theme is rich and this stays on my shelf for now ...

This game sounded so much fun. I really like the drafting mechanic, and also like fighting monsters. The game feels like it could have done with more tuning. The trophies play such a big part in the scoring, and feel so random. Not a good random. It felt like the monsters and trophies all negated any planning made during the drafting phase. 

I played it once, and donated it to my FLGS's library. 

*edit*

I have since played this a few more times. I still have the same complaints. The trophies at the start can overpower the game in the first round, but there are still two rounds left to play.

Rating is based on initial play.

I enjoyed this game and think it has a lot of potential.  It uses a strong set of mechanics to emulate a dungeon crawl, and gives the players a lot of choice.

This is very similar mechanically to 7 Wonders, but adds in a combat mechanism against game-controlled bad guys.  Instead of building your city, you're building your character to defeat opponents.

There are open objectives on the table that are available as you defeat different groups of bad guys, and these add VP's to your total.  This is similar to Race for the Galaxy's expansion, The Gathering Storm.

The game is a little fiddly, but overall this was easy to learn and something I would definitely like to try again.

Really enjoyed my first play of Lost Legends. It is just such a unique combination of card drafting, resource management, risk taking and set collection. Managing your character almost feels like managing a company or village in any other euro, but the consequences of an error could result in your death! Not sure how to explain it, but, surprisingly enough, the game appeals to the euro gamer in me and makes the drafting phase more suspenseful than any other drafting game I know. That is not to say that the game is without its flaws (especially rulebook and potential rich-get-richer problem), but in my opinion the good definitely outweighs the bad.

Pretty good and tight design! I like the draft & crawl dynamics. My only worries are replayability, scoring and snowballing (or better, lack of it for the unlucky ones that fall behind...)

I like 7 Wonders.  This is not 7 Wonders, and does not evidence the sort of interesting decisions I prefer, and that a draft often has the potential to showcase very well.  Very flat card abilities which provide virtually no incentive to deviate from the  obvious decisions.  Ditto with the monster combat.  Also, several of the other distribution rules (gold/monsters) felt very awkward in their respective contexts.

Light RPG management.
Simple combat.
Medium weight - there's a fair degree of difficulty here.
Medium interaction.
Medium theme application.

It's important to get all the rules right with this one, so stick with it if it doesn't seem to gel right away. Eventually I believe it forms a pretty neat game, and while perhaps not as elegant as it could be, is still a lot of fun. Funnily enough, it does feel a little like Eliot's own Thunderstone mixed with 7 Wonders, and approaching it from that perspective, it's quite a fun game.

thanks James & B. Need to play this more to fully appreciate methinks.

update: so many grumbles about this I'm starting to think Fallows dumped it on me as a joke. Determined to play it to death to prove otherwise. Card drafting always draws comparisons with 7 wonders, but this is as different to that as Fairy Tale is also.

update 2017: hammered this for a weekend and cooked up simple solo which plays through 3 levels. Tweak monster ditching/choosing to make easier/harder.

-1 point for the amount of luck in the Card drawing but I think it's playable even when you have not the best cards.

Seems to have several balance and swinginess issues, which are largely out of the player's control. Plays long too, so that makes it an issue.

Man I hated this game.  Played half a game and didn't want to continue.  Annoyingly abstract and confusing.  The tile art makes it unclear how tiles are divided, and the icons are in random places.  On top of that it felt extremely random - at half time scoring, after not being able to complete my objectives for most of the game, I somehow beat all the other players two times over.  But most importantly, the game was boring - just not fun at all.  I came away feeling angry, which has never happened to me when playing a game.

Convinced me that I not only don't ever want to play this again, I think I don't like tile games - at least not if they are like this one.  Not saying it's a bad game, just not a game for me.

You can tell right away that Okanagan has been inspired by Carcassonne and Walnut Grove, from which it borrows the tile laying mechanic and the landscape tile layout respectively. Gameplaywise Okanagan is definitely closer to Carcassonne, i.e., you place a tile and put a token (with a value 1-2-3) on it. Once landscape is completed, all players with tokens in the completed area collect resources according to the total value of tokens they have invested. So nothing new or surprising here. 

The thing in the game is that all players will score differently. One might be collecting wood while the others value fish. Scoring is decided by dealing five random cards to each player from which you get to keep three at the beginning of the game. This is basically the point where the game will be won and lost, provided that everyone has similar luck with the tiles. If you happen to get cards with good synergies, you will have a big edge over other players. Of course others can try to block you over the course of the game but most of the time this will be at the expense of their own points. Moreover, because the scoring cards are kept secret, others cannot know for certain what it is you are collecting before it is too late. This reduces the amount of competition because you cannot be certain if a move will block someone or not, and hence the total value of that move cannot be estimated.

I could play Okanagan for the tile laying fun of it but since the game does not introduce any fresh ideas to the genre and since most competition is suppressed by keeping the scoring cards secret, I’d rather played e.g. Carcassonne.

Rating na 1 spel op Spiel.
Lijkt heel sterk op Carcassonne, maar iets leuker en makkelijker.
Setjes verzamelen door tegels te leggen en invloed uit te oefenen in gebieden.
Half van het spel kan je nog je strategie veranderen als blijkt dat je moeilijk je setjes kan verzamelen, door nieuwe kaarten te trekken.
Net niet goed genoeg om te kopen, doch 2e hands misschien?

Similar to Carcasonne I like it better. Quite of back and forth ....do I want to win this territory  or take the default. Like it a lot better than Carc.

RATING: 5.5
Really a terrible two-player game. There is often little incentive to complete your opponent's regions because 1) first place is almost always better than second, and 2) even if you win a region, you are unlikely to want to give the other player the second-place benefit. The goals are all basically the same (they just differ by which tokens to shoot for) so the game just feels repetitive and boring.

RATING: 7.25
It doesn't really give me Carc vibes at all. I like that you're forced to put a building down on every tile you play. I like that there can be a benefit to having the least influence in an area, if the tile abilities are good.

A neat tile layer akin to Carcassonne with some added differences. The game play flows well and the art and design is decently good. The only thing I can see being an issue with this one is knowing what the special ability icon mean, though with a few plays I think this could be committed to memory.

Heavier than Carcassonne but shorter.  Nicer artwork too.  Mid-game players will need to be flexible with their strategy goals too.  Feels like an expansion or two was baked into the core of Carcassonne but with less take-that.  Very fast game for this many decisions.

RATING: 5
The same mechanic from Hermagor and Charon INC appears again in yet another more stripped down form. It works very well here, and the area control element of the game is extremely well done.

The game fails for me with the goals and negative player interaction abilities. I don't like secret goals, they leave you ignorant to how your opponents value things which takes a lot of the tension out of the game.

This also has no business being themed in the Okanagan Valley. There is nothing here specific to the location. Also it seems the Okanagan is full of white bearded men... how sad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Contrary to its appearance Okanagan is almost an abstract game. A turn consists of a player placing a tile and putting one building on it. Each building has an influence value between one and three and influences between all to a single area on the tile. When the tile completes an area, the area is scored according to the influence on this area and players collect the resources from this area. It can be beneficial to have the least influence to be awarded with a special action. At game end, resources of the players are converted to VP depending on the individual VP scoring cards.

Surprisingly lean and enjoyable although others might consider it to be too dry. Sufficiently different from Carcassonne as universal benchmark for tile-laying games.

Tile placement game.
I was hoping this to be - more.

Some luck of the draw involved.
Also a bit... dunno. A bit... none interactive? Compared to others in the gere at least. You don't bother stopping others, it's more important to focus on your own stuff and occasionally try to leech off of other's creations but by then they end up taking pretty much all the goods anyway...

Combination of tile laying, area control and set collection. Surprised me how much I liked this, it’s an easy game to grasp but a lot of tactics and room for clever play.

RATING: 6
More complicated version of Carcassonne. In addition to multiple types of area control markers (changes range & strength), the areas give you different tiles that you use for set collection in order to get points. Not really my bag, but I can see why people might like it.

RATING: 5
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Feels like a more involved Carc where regions score as they close up. Goal cards drive your tile play. There are tiles that steal chits from other players which may annoy people or force a trade. I'd play again but don't need to own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice looking game in great packaging and clear and easy to understand rules. If you were to ask me if i liked this more than Carcassone (with expansions) i would have to say no. However, it definetly looks better than its older brother.

RATING: 3
Very frustrating game. There are 9 different rewards, which is already too much to separate and setup for such a short game. Overlap of secret objectives can vary wildly, with some people needing the same single reward on all three of theirs. It's nearly impossible to plan your turn ahead of time because the potential consequence of your action is on the back of the cards, which someone probably thought was very clever but causes them to change constantly. Because draws are open, it's easy for other players to thwart you based on what you draw, which is a level of calculation I find unfun in this level of game. Just play Carc or a better tile-layer.

This tile layer is great!  Has a little Carcassonne flavor, a little Walnut Grove flavor, and a whole lot of its own flavor.  I really enjoy the three types of buildings and how you place them, and how each one gives a different amount of 'control' for a certain territory.  Also enjoy the 3 card objectives (and the option to get new ones throughout the game) you work towards each game (always making it different).  Completing territories is fun as well, because that's when you collect resources and/or get to take special actions.  Many cool mechanisms going on and great decisions to make in this simple to understand tile laying game.  Definitely recommend it!

What a great little tile game. Only one play so far, but toward the end of the game we began to see that larger confrontations are possible if the players and sometimes you can win by intentionally losing an encounter and getting a super-power as a consolation prize which flips the win condition to some degree or allows conversion of existing assets that can trigger large scoring opportunities. It may be too early to say it - but I think this one's absolutely in that golden zone of games that get played a lot. If it has enough meat to remain fresh over a number of plays, as I suspect it will, then I think it'll be major gateway game.

Got this one on a recommendation from a friend and came away feeling great about it. It's a very Carcassonne style game where you're laying tiles and placing something on it to gain influence. I love the way it works and how quickly it plays. A very nice surprise!

Played at Spiel' 17. Beautiful game, which has the tile-laying part in common with Carcassonne. In this game, you're trying to collect certain goods, specified on 'goal coards' which you get at the start and halfway the game. I enjoyed the timing-aspect of the tile-laying: when do you close an area, and how much influence do you want in it? Would not mind playing this again, rating could then go up.

I had this on my radar for Essen 2017 because the previews looked really nice, played it at the Matagot booth and had a great time and now own it :)
As everybody might know, this game basically *is* Carcassonne but with variable objectives (plus two preset ones that are always active) and a different way to "score" tiles, based on the powerlevel of the stuff you've built in various landscapes.

The preset amount of turns (12 per player) makes the playing field a bit smaller, so there won't be any 12-tile cities or fields like in the big C. The biggest I've seen so far is 6-tile forests and lakes and due to the limited amount of tiles being played (48 in a 4-player game) I think most landscapes will end up being 2 or 3 tiles big.

The variable objectives, luck-mitigation (there's 3 tiles out, pick one) and 'safety net' rules that give you something even if you get left in the dust when scoring tiles make this game a bit more friendly and less predictable than Carcassonne.

Also important: the landscapes you build together look really nice, the game has a very nice feel overall since the components are big, clear, the colour scheme is great and even though the theme seems a bit random it helps form the game into a cohesive, good-looking and satisfying package.

If you like Carcassonne (like I do) this game is worth getting, there's enough new stuff to keep your tile-laying appetites sated for a while and even though it lacks originality it's a very satisfying and tactical game. The only downside would be the promotiles which don't fit into any landscape and break up the game, but the easy solution is just not using those.

8/10 would play again would recommend!

Not sure about this one.  I love tile-laying games.  It seems like there's too much "scoring" in this one as you can basically close stuff constantly.  I'm just not sure I like that part of it.

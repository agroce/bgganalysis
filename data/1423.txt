Revolutionary game.  Still fun.  However, it feels like it takes a long time to play due to the lack of a sunset die roll.  This has been passed up by other Area-Impulse games, such as Circle of Fire.

I played the Germans and was not aggressive enough to push out the Red Devils in time%u2026 but I had a great time learning the game and look forward to playing it again.  The area impulse style of movement was great as always and the chit pull for dice rolls did not bother me%u2026 except that my chit always seemed smaller than my opponents %uF04A  Lots of replay for this game as we learn how to play it smarter, and how to do things like fire and such that we did not even try.

The Area Impulse Movement system wargames have evolved a lot. This one being the first - a revolution in my opinion - is still a remarkable game, in spite of some of the later game mechanics being missed.

Beautiful and accurate game map. What a few streets have been fought over!!

What I don't like is the Close Combat game mechanic, which is not in line with the spirit of the game. I also wished the fire setting being a little bit different. Further the British will have a lazy day. There isn't much to do, apart from holding out as long as possible. So that'll be all you have to do. Be creative with that!

Furthermore:
* Too many dice rolling with too much extreme outcomes
* Too many units in an area
* The turn goes on and on and on ...

Found the rules tightly-written, although I got sleepy the first time I tried to read them.  On the first try I played as the Germans, lost six (?!) armor to a combination of poor setup and worse rolls, and we restarted.  On the next turn I still managed to lose quite a few units, never took control, and barely scored any points by the game end.  I have an idea of what an effective push will be like next time, and want to execute it, but also wonder how many attack options there really are.  Anyway, love the map, like the game, ready for more.

This is a solid, medium-weight wargame for the grognard and an excellent springboard into more complex systems for the beginner. The situation is a tough one for both defender and attacker. Neither can be afford to be passive, but the German player must be aggressive and the British player must be patient enough to endure punishment and wiley enough to exploit a mistake. If you've ever read the book or seen the movie "A Bridge Too Far," the game captures the desperate straits of the British Paras perfectly. My first game lasted six hours, one of them spent in set-up and explanation. That seemed a long time for what I was assured was a pretty simple and manageable game. I'll be more careful before wading into it again.

I recently played a couple of games of SOA and have to say that I really like this game.  It feels similar to chess in a war tactics kind of way.  It has a depth of strategy that keeps you thinking as to what to do next and what are the consequences of your actions, as well you need to know what your opponent can do to you and when.  I never used to be a fan of area movement games but since playing SOA I like the concept and can't wait to play again.

Fascinating episode in British military history. Innovative (for the 80's) area impulse system. I really like the design of the board (area maps are much more attractive than point-to-point maps), the blind setup, the tactical advantage rule and the big counters. I've now made my own even bigger one inch counters with 'borrowed' artwork because I'm not keen on NATO symbols.

Good enough and replayable enough to merit owning both the original and folio versions. The system was new in its day, but it bore intuitive sense and mirrors the flow of the battle. In the vein of Squad Leader, it is a different type of design for effect -- but it is just as effective in its way. My daughter learned her numbers as a two-year old helping dad with the chits playing this game.

I remember one session against Ian Trout. His first time. In the first game he played the British and claimed at the end of the game that the Germans were unstoppable. We played a second game after lunch where he played the Germans. At the end of that game his opinion was that it was impossible to beat the British.

This is an extremely well balanced game - judgement is crucial - you must always try to keep a reserve as a threat to stop the opponent using all their troops.

The British are basically on the defensive. If the Germans over-commit themselves they will leave the British with the chance to counter-attack. The Germans, on the other hand, should have a definate plan of attack, including a time-table for their series of assaults into the town.

Played this game with a friend back in the early 80's and got my own copy a couple of years ago to get back into in.  Call a wargame buddy, watch "A Bridge Too Far", grab a six pack, and setup the game.  One of the best "atmosphere" experiences you'll have.  This game is very graceful despite it's age.  Area movement and tension as the clock winds down, Germans are desperate for territory, zones are in flames, and the British are struggling to hold on.

I love this game -- acquired it recently via trade. One of the first area movement/impulse games and a real classic. Other games using this system have taken the action to other places (mostly WWII) and added both complexity and some strategic diversity, but I think this still represents the sweet spot on the continuum.

Played once many years ago with an Army buddy. Seemed like a lot of fun - did not take long to get the rules understood and start playing (always a good sign). Will have to play again before rating.

Update (10/12/2008): Played for the first time in 24 years, and it was still fun! Many interesting and tense tactical decisions to make for both players from one impulse to the next. Timing your moves to end up where you want to be at the end of each turn is the trick.

Interesting variant of the system I'm familiar with from [i]Breakout: Normandy[/i]. This version doesn't have the terrain modifiers, but it does add the ability to attack adjacent units, special armor and anti-tank rules, unit reforms for the Brits and even fires.

The special rules for armor (movement), engineers (fires) and HQ's (integrity bonus and/or artillery spotter) add some nice flavor that makes sense and fits well within the system.

I'm not entirely sure about the overall game yet. It seems like a bit of a slugfest, but I've only just begun to explore strategies, so I'm no making any judgements just yet.

RATING: 8
[Allen] We finally punched this 24-year-old vintage and gave it a run. What an innovative little game! Rather than mass moving every unit on a side, players alternate activating areas. This really adds a feeling of gritty urban combat - little firefights erupting here and there, action and counteraction. Even the lower devense values after activation are clever, as holed-up platoons give their positions away by attacking. Really feels like desperate house-to-house fighting.
 
The few downsides seem to be wonky side-effects from activation [are you really able to single out and target a HQ that called in artillary?] and the fact that the British have less strategic latitude than the Germans. But even given these constraints, the game seems to reward seat-of-the-pants decisionmaking over pedantic predetermined term-paper strategies. A real breakthrough in wargames from the legendary Courtney Allen.

Wonderful game.  It is not only a tense situation, but it has a marvelous feel for urban combat.  Everyone is hunkered down until one group moves, then another group fires on them, thus exposing themselves to fire from other troops who expose themselves in turn...  the resulting chain reaction is fascinating.  The time scale of the game is inconsistant with the type of reaction discussed here, but the feel is unmistakable and often missing from other games on street fights.

Considering that this game game about in the early 80s, it's holding up remarkably. Very tense, with players feeling the highs and lows of the battle. The theme is great as well - this is one of those battles sufficiently immortalised in print and film to give players a rich sense of history. Only drawback is the playing time, given that the scenario and rules are relatively simple. The rulebook does suggest timed games, and it's probably recommended although this adds considerably more pressure on the players!

Great asymmetrical scenario with a near hopeless defense by the encircled British by an unprepared German counterattack. The attack rules are easy to remember and a fun series of opposed die rolls even out the luck unlike many other games.

Excellent,excellent game.  I'm often interested in playing older games simply to better understand the history of the hobby and to trace out where certain ideas come from.  While interesting from a learning perspective, many of these older games just don't hold up today, and feel dated compared to newer releases.  In this case, Storm of Arnhem is the beginning of the area-impulse series of games, and I simply CANNOT believe that this game dates to 1981!!!  It really does not feel dated AT ALL to me.  Sure, the graphics have a nice early 80s feel to them, but the counters are large, useful, and well-suited to the task.  The game does FEEL very different from later post-Breakout Normandy games because of the absence of the 'sunset die roll' that makes turn length variable.  As a result, Storm over Arnhem is more chess-like, in that players know that they will probably have a chance to move all of their pieces, and thus the game becomes more one of timing rather than prioritizing moves that characterizes later area-impulse games.  As a result, it takes a little longer to play, but it is ABSOLUTELY worth it!

Update: Played a few more times and I think this is a brutal game for the attacking Germans.  The  defending stacks are very powerful and mistakes are painful.  I'm worried that perhaps there is only one safe way to attack, and that different German strategies are a waste of time.    



I have the folio edition and am looking for the boxed version.  If you play at a reasonable pace this makes a great weeknight wargame.   It plays more fluid than it looks.  The game plays great but it seems very hard to win as the Germans.  The scale of the battle in this game has a 'small' feel to it compared with Thunder at Cassino and Breakout Normandy, others of the area movement system.  I think this small, tactical battlefield isn't quite as appealing as the broader conflicts so I'd rate it slightly lower.  It's a great game that I'm happy to play anytime and it offers plenty of room for exploring strategies, especially for the Germans.  I'm still thinking about how to crack the Red Devils...

The game that pioneered the Area-Impulse system, and spawned a whole genere of games.  It took a while for them to get the system refined.

It took me a while to get my hands on this again.  But before Christmas 2010, I finally did it!

Picked this up back in January 2011 unpunched.  Read through of the rules and they seem very nice and clean for a wargame of this detail.  The components are top-notch.  Both things I expected from Avalon Hill in the 70-80s.  Maybe I will actually have occassion to punch the counters someday.

Update: Played this again recently (May 2007) and was pleasantly surprised. Despite being lighter on rules than its successors, it certainly doesn't feel simplistic. Only problem is playing time: Slow players can easily average an hour per turn, which makes the game too long for comfort. Perhaps the "10 second" rule from the rulebook should be tried? :)

Like Mark Hermann's "We The People", this was also the first in a line of very popular wargames - the area/impulse system games. Using an extremely innovative system, featuring area movement, activation of only a single area at a time (the "impulses") and much more, the game set new standards for what an American wargame could look like. That being said, in my opinion SOA also suffers from being the first in a series of games. I have always found that the following games (especially "Turning Point: Stalingrad" and "Breakout: Normandy") refined the rules considerably, making for better games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
AH&#039;s first game in the area movement genre (followed by Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point Stalingrad, and Breakout Normandy).  A challenging situation for either player, though the German player, being on the attack, has more decision making.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Second play 20 years after my first and it's way better than I remember it being. (While I've had a copy on my shelf for literally decades, back in the day I overlooked this innovative title as it didn't have hexes - my mistake!)

Very nice mechanisms with just enough chrome to give flavour without bogging diown in detail. I like the interactive gameplay which forces some very awkward decisions, especially for the attacking German player.

If the German pushes hard the Brit can counterattack and hurt him badly (mistakes can be cruelly punished - if I have a criticism it's that a couple of bad battle losses can swing the balance). Alternatively as the the German you can build slowly and take fewer risks, but you know time is not on your side.

Playing with hidden British AT guns adds another level of tension for the German in particular.

While it didn't feel it during play, the game ran long and it didn't feel like were overthinking it. Consequently I'm not sure I'd want to go for the more complex, longer games in the series - this one felt just about right.

Great game, sparked my lifelong interest in Market Garden. Takes a few plays to really get the hang of what to do and what not to do - it's relatively easy to make a huge mistake and watching your position crumble - for the germans or the brits.

I love the desperate feel of the paratroopers, the reformed units just add to the grit of not giving up. In experienced hands the Brits can be a tough nut to crack.

Fast-playing, lots of decisions.  Rules seem more difficult than they are before play.  Although combat is based on a similar method later used in BK:N, SoA seems to be more of a dice contest once manuevering is over and the Germans have closed in, and presents a new puzzle -- how to push the Brits out from their core territory before the clock runs out.  Ground-breaking, classic design.

I like the area-impulse system very much.
So enthusiast about this system that I immediately bought 'Breakout Normandy' on ebay. But have not played it so far.
+  I use the card system mentioned in the variants. Game play is much more tense and in some way predictable. Bluffing and sacrificing units can play a more important role. 
Luck factor is significantly reduced with cards.
- Replayability is rather low I think
 after a bad move with the English, it's difficult to come back. Very hard to win with the English.
Only have limited experience.

The first and one of the best area movement impulse games.  The "two passes in a row" is a brilliant mechanism for ending each turn, and grinding out the tension throughout.  Requires nerves of steel, particularly as the British.

I love everything about Storm Over Arnhem.  In particular, I love the fact that it is the only game I can claim to be unbeaten:  maybe only ever had a dozen games, and only against three opponents - but you can only beat what the opposition puts up.  (Like Jerry Seinfeld, perhaps now I should choose not to run).

This is a design of the first importance because it launched an entire series/genre of titles known as "area-impulse" or "area-impulse movement" but the historical situation depicted in the game is simply too limited to achieve sustained interest.  The lack of a sudden-death end of turn mechanism also draws out playing time to intolerable levels.  By way of comparison, CIRCLE OF FIRE:  THE SIEGE OF CHOLM, 1942 (ATO #41, March 2014) contains many similarities to SOA such as simplicity, scale, a siege situation, etc. but has cleaner rules, a more fluid and dynamic campaign situation, more balanced sides, and plays in under two hours.

The General 'Series Replay' of this one between Don Greenwood and Alan Moon was one of my favorite ever General articles. Also, I just love the map to this one. The spaces all tend to have their own personality, and you associate many of them with good or bad memories after a few plays. Great design.

Based on one play, I like this game a lot, and I could see the rating going up to an 8. I'm not sure this has 10 potential, as I'm not sure it would hold up over numerous playings. But the system is interesting (historically, as well), and it works, and it challenges you to think in different ways.

There's definitely a specific weak point in the British defense (whether that's a glitch in the map or an accurate representation of history, I don't know). So based on studying the map and talking to someone who's played it before, it seems like most games will be a question of how soon that particular spot can be exploited. That's not necessarily a flaw in the game, just an observation.

Thanks, DrFlanagan!

This is a fun game and quite competitive. Can get pretty tense near the end as time starts running out. The supply of men usually starts running out too, for both sides. Combat can be pretty bloody. Only played 2 games and managed to win as both sides so I think it seems pretty well balanced. A good introduction to the area impulse system. I have played Breakout Normandy and this one is a lot simpler.

As I recall the first of the area-movement games.  A very manageable and enjoyable game that, in many ways, better simulates a higher level commander's view of the battle than, say, ASL or ATS which both have treatments of the same subject.  To my mind, this area movement game is only eclipsed by its later sister game, Breakout: Normandy, which gives both players a chance to defend and attack more regularly.

My favorite AH game. The first few games the Germans will overwhelm the Red Devils.....until you get the mechanics down and learn how to really play the Brits. Decisions, choices. When to pass, when to use the tactical advantage, it is very intense. Not complex but just enough chrome to keep you coming back. Might rate it a ten when I get around to including the variant "River Crossing" (The General May/June 1982 has the rules)

Good game, but Mike Rinella's comments on CSW that the introduction of the Sunset Dieroll by TPS and BN makes for much tenser games.  This game is more chess-like without a sunset dieroll, but perhaps that is appropriate given the scale of the situation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
Storm Over Arnhem was designed by Courtney F Allen, published in 1981 and was the first of Avalon Hill’s series of area-impulse games.  Focusing on the battle to control Arnhem Bridge during Operation Market-Garden, players take the role of either the besieging Germans or the besieged British paratroopers.

The rules are quite simple with virtually no chrome.  Players take it in turns activating an area and the units in that area can either fire or move.   Once they have moved or fired the units become ‘committed’ and flip over, which lowers their defensive value and makes them more vulnerable to return fire.  There are also rules for artillery fire, reinforcements and random events.  But overall the rules are easy to grasp and clearly written.

What makes this such a great game is the situation that develops on the map.  Players are faced with tough decisions at all times, do I move troops from one side of my perimeter and weaken the other, do I fire with one unit or with a group to get the bonuses, do I wait until my opponent has fired before moving into a enemy held area, how do I silence those AT guns so I can attack with my armour, can I stop my opponent from using his artillery and so on.

The area-impulse system with its alternating phases does a wonderful job of simulating the back and forth nature of house-to-house fighting that characterised this battle.  With the flipping over of committed units is a simple but effective way of modelling how units could lose their defensive advantage, ie - by firing and revealing their hiding places or moving and leaving their defensive positions.  

Storm Over Arnhem does a wonderful job of providing tough decisions with a small rules overhead and a manageable number of pieces on the board.  While Avalon Hill went on to produce other area-impulse games this may just be the best of them.  The tense gameplay coupled with a very simple ruleset makes this game a real joy.  On top of that it is also a fair simulation of the real battle, while still allowing the paratroopers to pull of a victory.

Storm Over Arnhem is well worth playing, especially if you are interested in tactical games because it has a very different feel to hex-and-counter tactical games.  It also plays very well on VASSAL with no hidden information and a small number of counters being moved each impulse.  This is a good addition to any collection and a great place to start if you’ve never played an area-impulse game before.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The first, and still the best, of the Area-Impulse series published by Avalon Hill and imitators. An engrossing study, with flaws in the British Order of Battle, but thankfully free of the over-complicated rules drafting of its successors. The situation and scale of the battle show the system working at its cleanest and most functional with less need for bolted on fudges or the layering of more comlex modelling. As a game it's fast and furious unless the opponent is one of the paralysis through analysis brigade. I don't think any single game outside of ASL in toto has seen as many playings on my gaming table since it came out. There are two versions, the original Boxed game with 5/8th counters and a mounted mapboard (although not up to standard AH fare) and a folio version which decreased the counters to 1/2 inch size but added a solid workmanlike hostorical overview of the battle. Volume 19/1 of the General mangazine featured the Crossing variant which allowed oweners of the game to start with a resolution of Gräbner's 9th SS Recce attack on the bridge itself. The counters for this variant were included in the game and offer a different take on the game. Some criticisms of the game have been because the british situation is very much a reactive one but there is room for the british player to mount a well timed counterattack when circumstances allow or dictate. Fast playing, it's a breeze to set up and get started. If you can, grab either copy and get playing. Far fewer Q and A or errata than its siblings.

This is the type of easy but not simple game. In fact, every time you play it you find new ways to do the same. Aparently, Germans has an advantage, but this is very tricky becasue if British sets up his strategy corretly it is very difuclt to defeat him. Anyway, the game trends to a draw most of the times so I recommend to play it from both sides just to feel the problems you face that are completely different. It is the first area/impulse game system a very creative way to play wargames. Very enjoyable and recommendable game.

First game in the Area Impulse system, and the only one I have played so far. For my first play of this I spent a week reading the rules and playing solo so that I would have everything down pat for when it came time to play it for "reals". My wargaming partner and I are, while not wargame experts, have played enough of them, and read enough sets of rulebooks to be considered "intermediate beginners". The rules were simple enough, one of the easier rulesets I've read a a matter of fact. I played a little solo, answered some of my own questions, etc, etc.Then, the night before I meant to play the game, I had a sudden fright. Is this game [i]too[/i] simple? Its really just move or shoot, a basic game without any chrome at all really, save the AT (anti-tank) units and a bit of artillery. So, I started reading the rules to another game I own, Fire in the Sky. But, this game ended up being [i]way[/i] too confusing for me to learn in one night, so, I gave up on it and decided to risk Storm Over Arnhem after all. And I'm glad I did.While being mostly just move or shoot, the game does manage to hold ones interest for roughly 4 hours, engaging the players in tough decisions and fun gameplay. The first turn is mostly the German player getting his units into position while the Brits open fire on them. The next few turns are a give-and-take kind of warfare, with most of the combat resolutions giving way to retreat rather than elimination (unless your crafty and cut off retreat options!) Dropping artillery into areas is actually simpler than regular combat, and can be fun for the German player to just repeatedly drop bombs into an area over and over and over again. The British player has much tougher units on the other hand, and it takes a lot to elimate his units without clever German positioning. Every turn each player feels like he is losing, which is something I expect from a truly great game. I mean, if you just [i]know[/i] you're winning the whole time, then whats the point? PoG pulls this off flawlessly, by the way. All-in-all, I would give :thumbsup::thumbsup: to Storm Over Arnhem as a beginners guide to not just Area-Impulse, but to wargames in general, as it does utilize many broad wargaming concepts.

Out of print area impulse wargame. Supposed to be light enough for mortals, fun, and well balanced.

RATING: 8
Play against someone who knows what they're doing and this game really shines. Units used to attack are flipped over to reveal a much weaker defensive side. All the time players are probing the other looking to exploit weaknesses - some through the opponent overreaching, some through a good offensive push, some through opponents trying to plug gaps in their lines by positioning their units. The big question is when to pass, when to move and when to launch just one more attack. It's a fantastic system where both sides have to work out the balance of when they've attacked too much that they've become a defensive target, versus not exploiting an opportunity and taking a chance. Sacrifices must be made, and the decision making in this game is nail biting. I'd love to get my hands on another copy of this one.

I used to own this game, rather. I just sold it to gentleman in the Czech Republic who was born in Arnhem. I didn't play it much but the TP: Stalingrad used a similar system and did get played several times. An enjoyable game system.

Five minutes into my first turn of Storm Over Arnhem, and I had learned the following things:
1) SOA was very innovative for 1982.
2) Half those innovations don't really work that well.
3) There was no way we were going to finish in less than three hours.
4) Apparently, Rush is Teh Awsome.

RATING: 9.2
Superb game on a theme which has always fascinated me. Most wargames had been of the I move all my pieces - you move all yours, which makes for long downtime. This introduced an impulse move idea, where each player alternates actioning just one group of units. This keeps both players constantly involved. Very playable - and the system has been re-used several times for different battles.

Designed by Courtney Allen who was also responsible for the brilliantly innovative UpFront.

RATING: 7
Impulse area control game innovation gives the grit and feel of British paratroopers hanging on to the last city blocks while the German panzer divisons crawl their way into the city proper. A real nail biter for both sides despite the momentum of history in this. A bit of an aged item at this point but still just as fun to play as ever.

A great game! Didn't get to play it till years after it came out. Wished AH used white on the British Counters instead of the black printing. They didn't have the concept of color coding back then but that would be nice to have with the British counters. Also a player's chart and better written rulebook would be improvements if it could be reprinted today. Still this game is a classic. The plays flows quickly and plays well solitaire.

Portfolio edition. Differences between boxed game:

- You draw chits instead of rolling the dice, which equals out the influence of luck to a certain degree
- Great historical article
- Counters are smaller, but color-coded (!)
- Map is laminated paper, but the same size

Very innovative design and the start of a great series. Good as an introductory wargame. It's tense but not overly complicated.

Great war game. If you play a good game as the British, you can give the Germans a good bloody nose before you get crushed. Good game but.......Monty....Whoever said you were Field Marshal material? You were right up there with General Mark Clark as one of the big Bozos of WWII.

One of my all time favorites. No two games tend to be alike. On any given turn there are so many options that the pressure is on both sides. If one isn't careful, their O.B. will be cheewed to pieces before their eyes. Never a dull moment.

What a marvelous game system and game.  The first of the A/H area games, this one plays quickly and offers tension at every turn.  Extremely re-playable due to historical situation as well as game system mechanics.  Playing either side is a blast and rewards good planning.  Won't ever part with this one.

This game is on my Top Five list. Though the first few turns feel pretty slow, as the units are killed off the pace of the game, and the excitment,  increases.  (BKN slows as more and more units are brought onto the map.) SOA always comes down to hand-to-hand combat on the last game turn in the shadows of the "bridge too far". Between two good players, a very exciting simulation.  Though the game system of BKN is better, the simplicity of SOA makes it more fun and something you can use to teach newbie wargamers.  (For BKN I recommend downloading the shorter Cherbourg scenario from Boardgamer magazine which covers only the breakout from Utah Beach.) This is a solid game purchase... if you can find it.

After owning this game for many years I've finally managed to start some game action via the excellent CyberBoard programme and I'm not disappointed. This really is a fun & fast paced game of tactical skill and nerve. No doubt at some point I will move on to the later games in the Area-Impulse series but for now this little baby has got my full attention.

My all time favorite game. Storm Over Arnhem is so well balanced that most games hang on the edge until the end. Some people claim that it is leaning to one side or the other, further proof of its balance. 
If you never played, then try it once and you will see its subtleties and plethora of choices, it's feints and counter moves. 
Can you tell that I like this game?

One of the few "owned and untouched" games from the 1980s that I may actually play.

Has great press, and has spawned multiple unofficial sequels: Storm over Stalingrad (2006), Storm over Dien Bien Phu (2014), etc.

It's the Avalon Hill fiddliness that will kill me, should I ever get up the nerve to try it out.

RATING: N/A
6/18/07 - So I played 2/3rds of the way through a game of SoA by myself.  I wasn't 100% sold at the time, but now that I'm exploring ASL I find myself wanting to pull out SoA instead from time to time.  From my limited experience, I found SoA to have a particular charm to it - perhaps derived from the intimacy of the scale coupled with the over-all desperation of the situation from the British perspective.  The later games in the series, notably Breakout: Normandy and Monty's Gamble, receive much higher accolades, but, from my inexperienced perspective, seem to lack the personality SoA offers.  I really hope to find someone interested in giving it a go with me so that I can reaffirm (or dissolve) my previous sentiments.  Finally, on the topic of complexity, SoA is relatively simple and straightforward (i.e. relatively exceptionless once you get over the new concepts inherent in the area-impulse system), however the rules are a bit more opaque than they needed to be.  In terms of wargames being produced today, I'd say SoA is really standing the test of time, which is a quality I really respect in a game, regardless of whether I actually care for it.

Rating after 1 play.
Seems to be a game where first choices are so many, that it's daunting. You'll need some plays (I think) before you comfortably make your first moves.

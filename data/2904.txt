3R is One of my favourite games of all time. But this version is not as good as the AH edition. Mainly because of the loss of the CRT replaced by an Axis & Allies style combat sytem. I own the first Avalanche edition which has the worst rules I've ever read and a misprinted board to boot! The counters were good though and at least the board was mounted.

RATING: 9
The best historical game ever made. It's also a great example of making a good game better. Although I originally wasn't sure about a wargame with a budget component, the economic factors add to the "grand strategy" required to play it. The political chits (random events with some historical plausibility) are great for shaking up a game without completely undermining the game play. The only reason this isn't a 10 is that some players are tempted to replay the historical course of the war and rule arguments often devolve into WWII trivia exchanges (I've fallen into both traps myself). It's the most fun with players who don't follow the historical script or conventional wisdom on playing a country.

Third edition rules make this playable. A lot of fun in the bucket of dice tradition. However the seemingly endless supply of German panzers (for which Hitler would have been grateful in 1941) and lack of Russian tanks make the Eastern Front a bit ahistorical.

Good simulation of the European Theater. When combined with GPW, makes an interesting Grand Strategic overview of the SWW. Muddled rules, lack of errata and quirky mechanics may scare new comers to the genre away. New Revised 2nd Ed. Rules take some effort and work to understand but is worth the effort. Note also that JP3R is more of a "What if" WW2 Grand Strategic game than an exact recreation of the ETO. I highly recommend checking out the Consim World forum for rules support. Very helpful to the newbie.

A decent re-make of the classic, but has since been eclipsed by games like Europe Engulfed.

The mapboard is too busy, imo, and I am at a loss as to why they chose to divide it inot three sections as they did. I would have prefered a paper map, personally. The rules could REALLY use a deecnt example of play.

Half way through the 1939 campaign. Am really enjoying this , a lot less "chess like"  and a bit wilder than the original. Map a lot fussier but counters are beautiful.

Avalanche's support for this game was not just abysmal but the whole project was actually kind of insulting and fatuous.  I've heard the most recent set of rules manages to finally make the game playable, but having seen vapid and vacuous expansions I doubt it.  The whole thing was surely an experiment in just how much can be charged for the littlest amount of real work, both in design and development, possible.  I have seen some recent maps done by vassal designers that make me want give this one another shot.  Maybe in a couple more years I will have finally gotten over the insult and so give this one last shot. This is the only game I am so critical about.  As a consumer I just don't like being treated this badly.

Have not played it enough to give it a meaningful rating. With the roll a 6 combat resultion, the initial impression is that this is the marriage of Avalon Hill's original Third Reich and Risk. On this scale, such a system may be perfectly valid. And while BRPs may be a crude method of factoring in economics into the game system, I have not seen a better way to do it in a grand strategic game that is both playable and removes the historical shackles. Extra credit goes to the company for resisting political correctness and not editing out tobacco products from the photos of The Big Three on the original cover!

I really wanted to like this one.  Parts of the gears of the game are truly well made but these fine points become blurred by many long procedures and fiddly points that are not worth the story.  

I had hoped this may have been the game Prados intended for Third Reich but I believe it is only payment of his name and an Avalanche Press design team.  It sold me on it, but I doubt Prados had much to do with this which I think is a wrong on both AP and Prados' part and their relationship to buyers.

But I do think the AP design team had same very nice gears in places.  The tactics ramp up, but the buckets of dice (which may equal easier game in the mind of a buyer) do not create an easier combat system than AH Third Reich.  In fact the dice create an annoyance as one needs to remember what dice go with what details.  And this can mean over 20 dice rolls at times.  

I will try to remember the solid ideas here.  The procedural and fiddly stuff drown out the solid. It is a 4 because procedures becomes gluey and confusing.  Some of the mechanics are 8 - 9. But the labor of the procedures become so congested our game had to stop.

Like the new maps, and counters.  Jury's still out on the land combat system: leans toward "Risk" frankly, but it does speed up combat resolution.  Like the naval strategic warfare stuff-excellent improvement.  I GREATLY dislike the one-size-fits-all air rules.  No indication of the immense tactical and technical superiority of the early-war Luftwaffe and Finnish Air Force.  GMT's "World at War" is a superior game and simulation IMHO.  Rules feel unpolished and there's several holes in them.  You would think after the flak Prados got for the Second Edition 3R rules, he'd make an effort for completeness. Lack of quick reference charts is surprising-especially given the cost of the game.

Repeated play shows clear unbalance in the game design. To put it kindly, it is the Axis player's game to lose. To put it less kindly, I will never play this game again.

Plus, this has got to be in the top-10 all-time ugliest maps in wargaming history, with stray hex-spines scattered through northern Russia as well as some frightfully distracting background textures.

RATING: 8
Very solid reworking of the old AH Rise and Decline of the Third Reich. Could have been close to a 10 but for the abysmal rule set and the error-filled, tiny-hexed board. Retains much of the flavor of the original but with significantly improved combat, naval, and strategic warfare systems. The political and diplomatic rules allow for a much wider scope of possible strategic developments, overcoming what I found to be the biggest gameplay flaw in the original. Naval and strategic warfare, almost completely abstacted out of the original, are now critical parts of the game that are far better integrated with the rest of the game. The CRT has been replaced with the bucket of dice, which many traditional grognards dislike. I was concerned at first, but found that it made combat resolution much tenser and more interesting - as well as more realistic. 

Overall, a real winner...but those rules - ARRGGHHH!!!!!!! If you purchase the game, do yourself a favor - write down every question you have as you play your first game. Then spend several hours at the consimworld.com forum for the game searching through the posts for possible answers. You can fill in most of the gaps this way, but even then you may have to make a house rule or two. The only major blemish on an otherwise excellent game.

RATING: 7
Is it really designed and updated by John Prados himeself?  Heard from the Consimworld that this is not but just the name of John Prados is given the permission to use.  If this is updated by him, I am interested because the original Third Reich from Avalon Hill is a very deep game and quite a challenge to master.  Plus, download the player aid file from above.  Someone compiled them very nicely and thoughtfully.  They really ignite my interest in buying the game, even though with poor maps (note there is a deluxe hard mounted map but the graphics appear to be the same).

I like John's design philosophy and his game is often deep and thought-provoking, although not always as direct as some others want it to be.  I am however like his design which after a while of thinking becomes abosrbing as it could and makes sense with a naturalisitic aspirations, i.e. unlike many strategic designs of the same scale on the subject, it is virtually free of restrictive and hard-wired rules to effect the historical outcomes.  This is a definite game for the grognards.

There was a tremendous improvment in the playability of this game and the flexibility of options available to each player with the addition of the third edition rules (prior rating would have been 7).

Although it uses the Avalanche "bucket of dice" system, I like this version of Third Reich. The map, counters, events, etc., are a huge improvement on the system and once you get going the turns go by smoothly.  I would recommend printing off some of the fan supported documents for tracking your economy, timeline for events, etc., as that makes the game easier to play.

Bookcase box version. Unpunched.  I will probably never play this. The original game is all but lost in the changes and a lot of the updates are unnecessary.  The map has so many borders and sub-border dotted lines that it is barely legible. Way, way too much political rambling, it almost tries to make you feel guilty for wanting to play it in the first place.  "Evil on Horseback" is available as a free download from their site, if you want German cavalry.  The only game in my collection that a salesman tried to talk me out of buying. In short...stick with AH's 4th Edition. :soblue:

I had owned the old Avalon Hill version and decided to buy this one for the improved components. Turns out while the counters are improved, the rules were just as mirky and the map (The hard-mounted mapboards) had this annoying black line separating each section. AVP did rectify this with a paper, enlarged and corrected map later, but that costs you $20. As far as gameplay, it gives a unique approach to this theatre in that several "what-ifs" can be played out based on chit draw. Replay value is high.

Pretty map and counters. Detailed politics and diplomacy. Interactive activations in turns. Sweeping mechanized exploitation. Amphibious assaults come like a bolt from the blue.

Sadly air and naval units are the same for all countries.

I only played the small Barbarossa scenario, but small is only relative here. It requires fast amounts of space on your table or livingroom floor, because of all the tables and aides. The rules aren't that enjoyable to read and leave you groping around in the dark on a lot of things, but a bit of common sense solves a lot of these problems. The counters are quite beautiful and the map-art too. My only major gripe with this game is the really, really, really odd way of mounting of the map. Europe is split in three sections from west to east and mounted maps being what they are, this makes playing across the gaps a real pain in the backside.

I never owned the older version, but by all accounts this game is totally different and as a result it gets some flack from guys who like the older game. To each his own.

A really solid game.  The newer version really cleaned up the mechanics and make it easier to play but didn't give up the hard decision making of the original.

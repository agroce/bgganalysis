Nonsense. This game uses everyone yelling at each other across the table as an illusion of fun. After the game, you'll be saying things like "Oh... you had the matching card I needed. I guess I didn't yell at you loud enough.". As a Co-op game, there is nothing special happening here. Your just matching cards BUT WAIT it's a somewhat large stack of cards! Boring and overly simple. As a party game, Spaceteam fails to give you a reason to laugh and interact with the other players, other than yelling at them for a brief moment before yelling at another player for a brief moment. Loud and plain rude. As a real time game... well that's the one thing this game actually gets right (sort of). The tension of putting together the ship in time is certainly there. It's just not a fun tension. If your looking for a chaotic and tense race against the clock, play Escape, the Curse of the Temple. If your looking for a wacky party game, play Monikers or Telestrations.

Uh, not much of a game. Seriously. It's kind of like coop Pit. Ask people for what card you want, and they give it to you. Everyone is doing it at the same time, because everyone needs certain cards, and it's all real-time. It's all a bit hectic and silly. Shout out to the manufacturer, though. The card quality is incredible.

Party game.  The Kickstarter videos show adults playing it, but really, you should have a few kids/teens in the mix.  It feels a little too silly for just adults.

The game Pit meets crazytown with obstacles, a common objective, and a few silly quirks.

A decent implementation of a card game version of the app but on easy mode. The difficulty can vary depending on how the deck gets shuffled and the app has more going on. Just get the app but if you can't, then settle for this.

RATING: 8
This is the first real-time board game I had ever played and I really enjoyed the excitement and tension that brought about. The game is silly with instructions for how you have to react to certain cards, it is thrilling and still difficult enough to require concentration and some strategy.
That being said, if your team is cooperative and can communicate, the game can be figured out rather quickly and is not as much fun to play afterwards.
Overall a wonderful experience, deserving a 10/10, but it did not last long enough for much replayability.

PS could be good for team/office bonding.

Waste of time.  Mindless nonsense. Theme is a joke; could have been anything.  Basically a party game for non-gamers.  Never again.  For a real "save the ship" game, try "The Captain is Dead", "Space Alert", or "Damage Report".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pass cards from a deck of tools around to fix bits of a ship against the clock. Essentially each player has a deck of cards to fix through and they have to ask for others to pass them cards. Its a riff on the tried and tested pattern matching game. What makes it good is a few accident cards sprinkled through the deck. Watching a player play cards with no thumbs (now a robot) or go quiet all of a sudden until others notice (gas leak) is quite fun and mixes it up a little. The downside is it seems to be rather hard to loose. Worthwhile for a few games but i doubt there is serious replay.

Very difficult to stay alert and actually comprehend what was going on. Played 8 people, and way too confusing and much shouting. A few of the players just sat in silence didnt knowing what to say and when.
Will try again with fewer players, but expecting it to be of same level. 
Shortly fun, but mainly just confusing and annoying. Almost impossible to keep the rules of handing cards leftward, and not just dropping everything on the table.

RATING: 3
This game is not my type of game. It falls into the category "coop stress". However, even if the game is not my type, I try to rate it as if it was. But what is missing in this game is that you don't feel that you have achieved something when winning. If we understood the rules correctly, it's nothing about skills, but only that you will be heard. Because some one will always have the cards you need. You just need to get people's attention, and you'll win. There were some laughter around the table, which makes the rating not a 2, but I doubt it will be much laughing the second time you play it. I'm sorry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Non-essential. Also, the rules are incomplete. What happens to cards when you're done fixing something? I can guess, but I'd prefer the two page rulebook would tell me. 

Admittedly, might be more fun with more than three, as passing adds to the chaos. But the app is so great, so portable, and so free. This detracts from the unbounded joy of the app. The finish on the cards is also easy to mess up without much effort, although they do feel nice.

I guess this would be OK if I ran out of battery power while playing Spaceteam, or if I were some sort of weirdo cardboard fetishist. I've given money to the Spaceteam... team... before for less, so I don't regret it, but I'll stick to the app, thanks.

Excellent adaptation of the app. The graphic design is great and the cards are high quality. I've played with this with multiple large groups, and it was a hit every time ("Let's play it again!!"). This is currently my favorite "party game".

I'm surprised that this isn't in the top 10 party games here, and it seems it's due to 2 common complaints I'm seeing in BGG reviews. I'll happily counter both...

1) Replayability
Many people seem to complain that they can only play it a few times in a sitting--I think this is a good thing! It's not a game to build your game night around; this is a perfect in-between game to play a couple times in between longer heavy games.

2) High stress
This game is intense and might be uncomfortable for those with social anxiety and/or communication problems--issues that tend to be common among gamers(!)--so I understand that there are some who won't enjoy the game. That said, it's quick (5 min), so the discomfort is not prolonged, hah! Out of 20something people I've played with, only one felt too uncomfortable playing.

I simply loved the app this game is based on. I knew I would enjoy this game a medium amount. And I did. The chaos and short play time is an easy sell. It's meant to be fast and accessible but then there are a lot of weird cards that require all players be familiar with them. Almost nailed it.

A crazy chaotic shouting coop game with a space theme. The anomaly cards really make the game fun, as the main mechanic of quickly passing off cards to adjacent players and around the table would not stand up on its own. Game is quick and over in 5 minutes and allows for a high number of players. This makes me want to play one of my favorite games, Space Alert, after.

Slick cards were dang annoying making it challenging to shuffle. As well, the game itself really isn't much more than trying to shout over everyone else. I can see it being somewhat fun with a higher player count, but three player is pointless and way too easy even on the hardest level. Why not just play the IPad game instead which is much more fun. Silly cards to recreate the different handicaps were relatively tame and boring.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/Lo9oB635jGI

Spaceteam is a quick, simple, shouty co-op card game based on the app of the same name. Each player has a deck of malfunctions and a hand of tools. When the timer starts players will turn over a malfunction and attempt to fix it with the tools. Of course the tools you need might be in someone else's hand so you need to shout out and get them to pass it to you. All this while everyone else is doing the same. A great fun, light game good for inbetween or at the start of gamenights. There are ways of making the game more difficult and a website with a timer. Recommend for those who like light coop chaos.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Spaceteam is a fun, if chaotic, co-op where everyone is trying to simultaneously work there way through a deck of cards to build a space ship. The difficulty is that each deck is filled with obstacles you need to overcome by playing certain cards, so most of the game is spent yelling for a depthgrater or other such tool. There are also cards which make the whole group do something, such as count down from 10 with your eyes closed. The real challenge is that you only have five minutes to complete the task. 

We played as a group of eight with our friends and definitely had fun. Spaceteam is a game I could only play in small doses, it gets loud and once the novelty wears off the fun quickly vanishes. I'd be happy to play again since it plays so quick, but it's not a game I'd want to own. On the plus side, it is simple to teach and would work well in a group setting where you have folks that don't play many games.[/i]

Never played the app, so I'm treating this as a boardgame measured against other boardgames, and I've had both great fun with it and little fun with it, depending on the group dynamic and how late at night it gets played. Everyone's trying to get thru their personal problem deck asap, and to remove a card you need to solve its requirement using tool cards, which if you don't have, you'll be requesting from other players. And so cards go flying around the table as fast as possible, with interruptions generated by the problem decks that generate some laughs (but which are too often too confusing to digest and resolve quickly enough for max enjoyment), like everyone change seats, or pass cards, and so on. Each player needs to dual-focus on getting what they need plus maintaining alertness for other people's requirements in case you're required to help. You either win the game by getting through the decks before the 5 minutes are up, or you don't. It's a rowdy opener for the night. It has that old-time Pit feel but with more smarts required, plus it's co-op so everyone's in it together. Best with more players.

It's a fun game if you like cooperative games and/or chaos/shouting games. I played with a group that got really into it and took all the "anomalies" really seriously which made it extra fun. I found that it played best at the very hard level, but I was also playing with a competitive and crazy focused group. The music timer is hella fun from their website. Only complaint is that the cards are a slick plastic which makes them so slippery they feel like they're coated in butter! A good "in between"game since it's timed.

Fun at first but after two or three plays (about 15 min) I'm ready to move on.

I really enjoy the app this is based on, and this is an excellent adaptation.  The game is better with more players, as it gets slightly repetitive with too few.  Varying difficulty levels make sure the game is still a challenge no matter what the level of play.  Great for larger groups.

Dumb fun really. There isn't much going on to this game but it shares the same qualities of pit in that you are all just shouting over each other. The more you play this with a group the more of the randomly bizarre names you can remember which makes it easier. Admitedly, it is pretty hilarious when an unsuspecting bystander walks into the room while people are shouting over each other things like, "Who has the centrifugal disperser damnit!"

I backed this one entirely on the strength of the graphic design and the fun I’ve had playing the mobile game. Is it good? After one play I’m not sure. It felt kinda boring to be honest, but we were attempting to be quiet because my son was sleeping, but it didn’t feel difficult at all. We all figured out what we needed to do pretty quickly and none of the anomaly cards hurt us too much, though they were pretty funny and novel. I could see this game quickly getting boring and the expansions don’t really add anything new, just more of the same.

Silly adult content real time party card game where all players at once have limited time to call out pictures and words and symboled tool cards to get through malfunctions and complete a space ship puzzle. Light fun, entertaining to see the group dynamic unfold, if you are shy you have to make your needs known... You may have a piece of the ship.  It's funny listening to how everyone describes their card needs... That's where the adult humor comes in.  Bigger the group the exponentially more chaotic the task becomes. Playing without thumbs plain sucks.  Definitely gets easier as players become familiar with the cards.

Better than the app in that a play ends after five minutes instead of just going and going.

Got this for Christmas 2016. Seems too easy so far, even with all cards in deck, when played with four players. Looking forward to playing it with five or six players.

My friends and I read the rule book, crushed the game on normal, read the rule book again to see what we messed up, crushed the game on a harder difficulty, read the rule book a third time, and crushed the game on the hardest difficulty. It was fun for a five-minute filler, but it felt too easy. Additionally, the cards are slippery. I mean, REALLY slippery. I dropped the whole deck three times.

Didn't expect too much from this, but this has quickly become my kid's most-requested game.  And at only 5 minutes a pop, we can usually fit (at least) one in every night before bed.  Can't wait for the next expansion (after NSFS).

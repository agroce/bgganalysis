A very fun game of role selection and building a 3D city.  This game is very easy to learn and is extremely interactive.  Once constructed, it makes for a very cool looking board as well.  The gondola is completely unnecessary chrome, but I like that touch.  Very nice components.  Easily plays under 90 min up to 6 players.

RATING: 7
A fun, light 3-D game where you play cards, try to outwit your opponent, then pass your played card to them, then guess which card they will play next. Easy game for newbies to pick up. This would also be good with non-gamers. 

The high production value makes this one a good value for a filler.

RATING: 6.3
The role cards are the heart of the game and the way they are handled is very original. If you take a good action you are sure that your opponent will have the same option next turn. Also the possibillities to speculate and profit from other people's actions are very nice. The actual building of the city is highly enjoyable also as it looks very nice. With 5 or 6 players you seem to lose grip on what's happening.

It has a neat little mechanism where you pass the card you play to the player on your left so they can use that action in a future turn. There is a lot of player interaction on the board as well.

It also looks nice on the table, though my lack of coordination and fat fingers might be a deterrent for me in the future. :)

A six player game of tile placment and blind bidding (in a way).  Turn order is important, but not in the normal way.  Sometimes, it's good to be early and sometimes it's good to be on the end and it depends on the action card you want to use.  A simple game but tricky in what you play.  Very tight, as well.

RATING: 6
An interesting abstract-ish game that requires some psychology to make a good guess about what action card your opponents will choose on a given turn.  I like building on top of previously built pieces, but the key feature is that building on top of your own pillars is very bad (it essentially costs you victory points)... and you must work together with opponents (to a limited extent).  The game can end abruptly and the number of pieces in the bag is essentially a game timer so (like Alhambra) it is important to "feel" the cloth bag to estimate how many pieces are left... and to choose your actions accordingly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not horrible; but it's too light for serious gamers; and not good enough as a filler. Not a lot of meaningful decisions as a lot of it is simultaneous selection.

Will not likely see this replayed.

The board play reminds me of Ravensburger's Arkadia, only not as interesting.  Simple rules but also fairly simplistic gameplay.  A lot of attention seems to revolve around getting the timing right of winning the Gondolier and then executing a build phase while you still own him.  I'm sure there are other strategies to win, but in the end the game just doesn't appeal to me.

I've only played this once so far, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be a keeper. I had to print up a cheat sheet with the card descriptions on them, but I suspect if you've played it a few times the sheet will no longer be necessary.

RATING: 5
A fine family-weight game.  I think the physical layout of the game is more interesting then the game itself, with the placing of pillars on the board and then placing of tiles on the pillars.  Overall, a cute design that's fun, but is missing a certain something from making it something I'd choose to play often.

Relatively short and simple game but with an interesting mix of card play (choosing a character/action) and board play. The interaction of the various cards lifts this above the usual dreary eurogame. It does suffer though from kingmaking throughout. Only available in German so far but not very language dependent - just print out a list of what the dozen cards do.

Despite the German text on the cards, people "get it" pretty quickly, and have a favorable impression of the game.  Someone remembered it from playing a while back and requested it again, so I'd say it was a modest hit.

RATING: 4
Would have been a nice and beautiful family game. But the end game went on and on and on as nobody wanted to play the 'pillars card' which ended the game in order to still have a chance at improving their score and those far behind didn't want to be king makers as the leader was constantly changing. This game needs another or a different game end condition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Beautifully produced (although the gondola can get in the way....but it is nice).  I think I would enjoy this game more with less players. Played once with 6p.  The card play/pass mechanic is neat, but overall there will be times where you're just screwed with a hand that doesn't allow you to do an action you want to do.

There's some luck and randomness.  The up-side is that its fairly easy and plays quickly. Its a good lighter family game. There's a little bit of direct screw-you play, but not too much. 

It would be nice to have an English production of this one.

"I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine."   A game that looks very cool, and actually has some neat character selection mechanics.  But, ultimately, it seems like the game is more about deciding who you want to give points too other than yourself.  Then they return the favor and somebody wins.

RATING: 6.5
Nice looking game that should appeal to families and gamers (seems like a strong candidate for Spiel Des Jahres).  There are many ways to score points and because cards used by players are passed to their neighbor after each round, cards are recycled throughout the game maintaining a tolerable level of luck.  Not recommended as a two player game as one player can hoard the Spy and Gondola.

RATING: 7
Played once, with 6 (and lost quite badly). I'd like to try it with fewer as it felt that progress was quite slow, though turns were fast and the mechanic whereby some cards allow a player to copy actions of or steal cards from others kept interaction up. Game components are lovely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoyed this although it finished much faster than I expected. The german text on the cards is no problem, but the rules translation we used could have been better. The game is very quick and simple, and the abilities of the characters are easily explained and well balanced. They could have put less text and slightly bigger/better symbols on the cards, but our crib sheets were good enough. As we played, we negan to see the different strategies open up, and knowing where the start player was each turn made a big difference, as did owning the gondola. A good fun german game, another one to add to the shopping list.

RATING: 5
Nice components, it plays 6 players, and it plays pretty fast.  There are a couple of nice ideas here, but it never really managed to elevate itself above the mass of other Euros out there for me.  If the theme is looking intriguing or you need 6-player games, I'd certainly look into it, though.

Warning: rating based on a single 2-player game. I don't know... The mechanics are neat although a little unoriginal. The components are great. The mechanics work well. The game flows nicely. Why that rating? Because somehow it fell flat with us. It's not really engaging as you're mostly thinking one move at a time. You're building, yes, but apart from a couple of pillars you don't "own" anything on the board. As a result, strategic options are really limited and you can't really see where your going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game in which it is almost impossible to score without having someone else participate in some way, so it is mostly about setting yourself up so that you can leech points off other players' builds. The simultaneous action/role selection mechanism works fairly well, but the card management choices are perhaps overly constrained.

its a good game, i played in Essen friday evening, I do not recommend this game for two players because the board its quite big lots of room to play pieces so therefore there is no so much interaction

Fantastic production values for this game with the chunky wooden pillars and the attractive building tiles.  I really like the combination of secret roles and the jockeying for position for building the building tiles.  Game plays pretty quick for two and there is plenty of interaction between players.

RATING: 7
I like this game alot.  In a lot of ways it is everything I hoped Citadels would have been, without the dragging time.  The decisions are all important and perplexing, as everything you play you give up to the person next to you, plus you enable others to take advantage of their possible actions.  Nothing in this game goes without aiding someone else, so maximising your own interests while minimising the gains of others is an interesting balance.  As aforementioned, the length of game in contrast to it's weight is perfect.  Two mechanisms are built in to not allow the game to drag, something Citadels didn't have.  An easy nine, possibly a ten when played a few more times.

WOW, what an awesome game. It looks great and plays even better. Easy to teach/learn, plays quickly and will play up to 6 players. Once you get a few plays under your belt a lot of the strategies become apparent. This is truely an excellent and fun game that really deserves an english print. If you can work your way thru the german text on the cards, which should be easy with player aids or stickers for the cards. All of which you can get here on BGG. Then I would highly recommend this game. I almost didn't get this due to the cards being in German, but it was easily played with the help of a translation sheet. I am very very glad that I decided to go ahead and get this game. Thanks to all who took the time to review this game and help me decide to purchase it.

Yet another Goldsieber game that deserves an English edition.  Great mix of Citadel-esque role selection and tile laying and building.  I prefer this over Citadels and Mission: Red Planet, and the production is very nice.  You don't need to hold out for an English edition really, but it would be nice.  Kreta is another one that should come out in English.

RATING: 5
Average game, not bad, but definitely not good enough to choose it over all the others.  I don't like the left/right binding of the gondola.  If one player holds the gondolier card for several turns without playing it, the player to his right can earn a bunch of extra points.  If you like the central mechanism here, go with something like Hoity Toity or Mission Red Planet instead (or any number of light card games like 6 nimmt or Pick Picknic).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Surprisingly good light game(as I did expect only a mediocre game). Plays good even with 6 players. I am not yet sure about long term replayability so rating may change with additional plays. (Rating after two plays one with 3 and one with 6 players)

Actually a very good game which should be interesting for familys and more geeky players alike. 

The only negative I found was the end game condition. There should really be another one, as the game starts to stagnate at the end, as the players points should always be close to each other.

Away from that, it's pretty cool and differs enough from other games.

RATING: 5
Card driven game, with similar principles to Mission: Red Planet where players struggle to get victory points by using their character cards most efficiently. The fact that the game allows you to build as well as steal your victory is quite interesting. Need to play more to get a more defined view on the game, but a good first impression.

RATING: 6
Blind action won't ever be my favourite game mechanism, and this combined with reasonably close scoring means that there's fair bit of luck in who wins. The board is far too big for the limited number of columns, meaning that players tend to concentrate on their own districts, and the end result (with tall columns and squat building tiles) is aesthetically very ugly.

I bought this game mostly for its cool visual appeal/theme (look at all those columns!), and I was pleasantly surprised to find that there's a very good game here. This is game of leeching off other players' actions and trying to score points on your own without giving too much others. I really like it. The rules are quite simple and intuitive, although I do recommend printing the English versions of the cards that are available here on BGG.

City buiding:role selection:hand management:tile placement:
variable player powers

initial rating - 1 play 3 players and 1/2 play 2 players - Essen 06

Another enjoyable city building game incorporating role selection, there is a little more going on than that though making it worthwhile playing. 

The start player each round is decided kinda randomly and this seems like a strange decision and maybe not a good one as their is some advantage to going first from what I remember. Each player starts the game with 5 cards with different roles depicted on them. Players decide secretly which card they are playing and then all are revealed and played out starting with the start player. Roles available are the usual:  Take city tiles from supply, building city tiles on board, placing pillars; however there are some twists here. A lawyer role helps with building, there is a gondola placement role(for bonus points), a saboteur for destroying a building, a spy for stealing a card and a beggar to copy an action someone else played. There are also 3 roles that hand out a bonus if another card has been played at the same time by someone else.  Points are handed out for a few different things including where and how you built a building, pillar points, gondola bonus and bonus cards. Once cards are played and points are given the cards are shifted to the left and the process repeats.

These roles are quite interesting and introduce some clever strategic card play, bluffing, double guessing and screwage into the game. Fun in a Citadels kinda way using the roles to help you or hinder others. A little planning required but not a deep game, play is somewhat dictated by your hand, what others have done and what you think they will do. A dose of luck in the game, I'm just not sure yet how well it can be mitigated or if it doesn't need to be and is a non-issue. 

2 players didn't work so good as there is an inclination and incentive to build in your own areas and card play is blah, 3 was good and 4 might be better yet.

RATING: 6
Fun, although as you can only perform one action per turn (the main options being build columns (which act as building foundations)/lay building tiles on previously played columns/collect new tiles from stock) you're very dependent on the previous players leaving you something to build on. 

In the game I played one player was able to hang onto the gondolier (after playing it, he became the lead player and picked the gondolier out of the hand of the player he'd just passed it to) and the winner was never in doubt from that point. The situation may not occur every game but if it does the player will be very hard to stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool game, but the end game needs work.  I really like the game mechanics, but the whole game seems to break down near the end when the people who have 'just' the right cards are the only ones who have a chance at winning.  The Start Player and the Spies don't have enough power to stop the leader.  We played with 5... but I think that the game would play better with 4 (I don't think that the 'kingmaker' effect would be as pronounced).

I've since played again with 4 and 6... it does seem to play better with 4.  The end game problems we had in our first coule of games wasn't as pronounced either... in the last  game the winner woon by a single point... and the other players were no more than 6 points apart.

1 play. I didn't have any expectations for this game as I haven't heard much positive about it. So I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that it uses the simultaneous action mechanism which is one of my favourites. While it was ok to play the game didn't grab me enough to play it again. Adel Verpflichtet does the same in a more interesting way and it's 15 years older.

We underestimated the gondola. This decided the winner in our game. It needs a concerted effort to keep the gondola moving and distribute the points evenly. If players with the right power to make a move for the gondola are sleeping, the winner is decided. I also didn't like that a kingmaker factor comes into play when there are many unused pillars with player markers and a third person can choose who gets the points. This can be mitigated to a certain extent by placement of markers but not completely. As I would expect scores to be close between players with one or two plays experience, kingmaking can decide the game. Also there is no rising tension and the game end comes abruptly.

To end with positive things: the components are on the usual high Goldsieber standard and the game is easy enough to be played with occasional gamers. It doesn't take too long to play.

Enjoyable game, which is lighter than it appears.  I like how quickly it plays.  The initial card distribution can make it difficult for some players to progress.  I would like to see the different types of strategy that players use.  I played with 6 players, and I would like to see how it plays with fewer, as the game ended almost too quickly, it seems.

The game board looks great when the city is growing. Components are awesome and the game plays quickly. 
Almost every action has an effect on other players, so everyone is involved all the time - which is something you don't find in many games.

RATING: 6
I have some issues with this after a few plays.  I think that a player hoarding certain role cards may create unusual game play.  There can be (both) deliberate and inadvertent, kingmaking quirky choices.  Also, determining who can trigger the endgame is kind of randomn. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Need more plays to really know for certain what I think about the game.  The components are superb and the game looks great when the game is completed.  The game primarily focuses on role selection which grants different actions from potential instant scoring, building and claiming pillars, buying buildings, building buildings, destroying buildings, taking control of the gondola, stealing cards from other players, copying a role played by someone else, etc.  Role cards used are then passed on to the neighbor on your left.  Scoring primarily occurs via the special score cards, building buildings, someone else using your pillars to build buildings, and owning the gondola when someone builds along the canal.  Game ends immediately when the last pillar is built.

This is a solid 8 and may be an 8.5.  It's a really curious mix of simultaneous role selection, with a slight drafting element, married to an abstract puzzle game.  I have never seen a game quite like it.  It was well worth the time to track down and the creation of custom translated paste-ups for the German on the cards.

The "bits" are amazing, and it feels like you've really built something.  It's a euro that features heavy player interaction, as you must pay close attention to what your opponents are doing and what they are likely to do.  You also are all playing on the same board, so must consider placement of your cities, where you think opponents are likely to place, and how to maximize points with tile matching.

In the end, it is a tactical game, but the tactical decisions are pretty quick while having a surprising amount of depth.  A new player can jaunt right along, while an experienced player may have a lot to consider to optimize play.

I feel this could lead to a weak player benefiting others, and the Puerto Rico problem of benefiting a player to the left might be a small problem, but I'm not sure.

I think the sweet spot is probably 4 to 5 players.

Lots of really interesting concepts thrown in there, I really like the action selection mechanism. You want to use the good actions, but by doing so you let your opponent use it to. So it becomes kind of like a hand management/action management mini-game wrapped inside a very different area controlish/buildingish type game. I found that the actions were a little too balanced for my taste (although future plays might prove me wrong), and the game took about 20% too long for what it is, but I definitely enjoyed my experience and am looking forward to more plays.

A wonderful combination of building, sharing in the wealth and player powers.  I like how all of the "screw you factors" that are inherit in many player power hand management games are balanced so that the player being picked on gets something in return.  As far as the building phases go you can gain VPs by investing in the foundation of other player's buildings.  Each player has 5-cards each turn to choose from and I felt that I always had a few good choices in hand.  UPDATE (bumped rating down a point): Already having second thoughts about this game after tonight's two plays. All three games I've played seemed to end too quickly for my taste. I think I may be taking the game too seriously as it's certainly a little lighter than I originally thought and you have to be thick-skinned as you're not always going to have the cards you want; sometimes when you do get them they're stolen right before you get to use them. Still, I enjoy the design.

Some very interesting mechanics in this one. The "pass the card you just played to the left" is cropping up in a few places at the moment, but works very well here. 

Towards the end of the game, you're trying not to pass certain cards to certain people, but they can always nab one from you given the right circumstances.

A lot of fun, and a good-looking game as well, and one that you can't win without helping other people at the same time

A game of variable player powers.

You choose a role. The flow of the game is that pillars are placed next to the central canal and extend from there. Players claim pillars which are scored when they are built upon. Points can be scored for building buidings strategically and choosing the right cards.

Unlike other variable player power games, the cards are passed to the left after they are used, giving you different cards each turn.

After two playings here's my opinion. The art is not that great and it really doesn't look like Venice when you're done building. It may sounds silly but it really affected my opinion of the game. Venice is my favorite place and I was hoping for something with more of a Venetian feel. Others at the table commented on the pieces not looking quite right too. I like the way the game plays and I did have fun, but was frustrated by my cards the first game and had the opposite "problem" in the second game. I was far, far ahead most of the game because I always had Pitch cards to play. I didn't have to build my initial two buildings until more than half-way through the game meaning I just built pillars for everyone else to build on to score my points. Maybe we'll figure out a strategy for this at some point. 02Jun07--Played again and have realized that the number of complaints about the "timing issues" of the game are coloring my enjoyment level.

This is the first game I've played where tiles are placed on top of pillars. It makes the board look really good as the game progresses, but this is more than a nice looking game. There are several choices each player can make during their turn with cards and strategy when placing pillars/tiles is key. Timing when to play the Gondolier can gain you big points. Overall this is a game I doubt I'd get tired of playing anytime soon and is good as a 2 player as well as 5 or 6 (though more chaotic with the max.).

This game plays well and finished very close, the key seemed to be timing the finish to when you'd be in front (not are) which introduced a lot of tension late in the game. It looks nice when set up and was a hit with everyone who played.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: You place poles on the board around the grand canal in order to later build on it. This is based on the card you play each turn and cards will pas around during the game. The goal is simply to get to 80 points before anyone else, so you must think fairly short term. There are even cards that just give you 6 points if another player performs a certain action during one turn. A nice fairly light game with hand managements, take that and sharing of points with others in order to advance yourself. A pleasant surprise.

A lightweight game that plays in under an hour.  Nothing stunning but a nice play nonetheless.  I had a lucky win my last game -- I managed a move that let me sneak one spot ahead of the rest and, as the start player next turn, I was able to instantly shut down the game for the win.  A lucky break.

No clue why this game is rated 2.3 for weight.  Way too high.

1 play. Each player has a hand of characters and chooses one to play each round. This is the action that player takes, similar to Mission: Red Planet. Half of the actions are just VP's if another player played this or that character. These cards actually give you quite a bit of points, so I would say its a viable route to victory, if you can guess right. Other cards let you build the columns, build on the columns, get more building into your pile, etc. Enjoyable, even though I lost pretty hardcore.

RATING: 6
The best part of the game is the pillars. You want to set them up such that you make your opponent happy since he can build all his tiles on them, but also piss him off since he's giving you points by building them on your pillars.

This game has an abstract feel by getting you to think about how to fit in all the different shapes of the tiles, but the theme fits perfectly. I love the tactile feel of building pillars, then tiles. It's very cool to see Venice undergo different stages of construction and tear-down, as you strive to score yourself the most points while giving your opponents the least.

The game-ending condition was interesting in my first play, as the leader tried to end it while the others deprived him of Pitch-Dippers until they caught up. There might be some issues with the game-ending condition -- I'll have to play more to judge -- but I doubt it.

I don't like the simultaneous action selection, pass the start player, give card to opponent fluff. It undermines the very good spatial gameplay.

Build columns + building in venice by choosing one of the role cards in your hand to play. Once a card has been played it passes on to the next player. You get points by building buildings and extra if they connect with adjacent building tiles of the same type. Points are also obtained when other player build on columns you own.

RATING: 8
This is the ultimate share and share alike game.  It is almost impossible to do anything in the game without helping another friend along.  This will be quite frustrating to some, but I think it's rather neat.  As you reach the end of the game you are faced with some pretty fun choices as the building types start to run thin.  I love the fact that if you use an action you pass it to the next player, so you can put a blockade on types of actions by hording them, of course the Start Player has the chance to remove them from you.

There is nothing overwhelingly stellar about this game, but I find it fascinatingly playable. I enjoy the way the city builds and there are some great choices in how all the pieces fit together.  The ownership markers make for some tough choices as you want other people to play them on you, but you may want to build on yourself just to stop leaking points out to everyone else.  I keep wanting to think that the Gondola is overpowered but it whips around so much that everything seems to even out.

As beautiful as the game looks while you are playing it, it certainly has some ugly card art, and the Gondola certainly ranks high in the useless piece catagory. There is something about this game that really appeals to me, the way that a mangy old dog can become your new best bud.

Update: with 6 the end rushes up a bit too quickly.  Also, there can be a problem if one player starts with all the Baumeister cards.  If you ever have four or more of any one card type you should reshuffle.

My initial impression is very favorable to this wonderful hybrid that is better than the sum of its parts. A little bit of Citadels (choose a character) with area control and tile placement ala Carcassone thrown in for good measure. It was very easy to pick up and for a six player, moved along quite quickly. My one complaint is that it moved along TOO quickly and just ended. Certainly not as dramatic in ending as Big Kini but would have been good to realize a head of time. Subsequent plays will hopefully correct that. The role cards seem tremendously well balanced and I love the mechanic of play and pass. Too bad I never got my hands on a saboteur to help purge clogged areas or one of the special cards to get 6 victory pts if someone plays X. But a fun fun game that I would love to play again.

Solid game that is very underrated.  High recommend that you use ArtsCow to get English card translations as it makes the game run much smoother.

This is a solid midweight euro and a nice addition to any collection.

This was fun for the first 2/3rds, and then plowed to a halt as we crept toward the endgame.  Those in the back were trying to wring out a few more points and hang on to the game-ending cards.  The end game wasn't satisfying, but I enjoyed it until then.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game! It plays quickly (45min) -- perhaps too quickly, actually; the end can come sooner than you think if you're not looking for it. There is some randomness in the cards you're dealt, but played cards are passed every turn so you'll eventually (usually) see what you need. On the other hand, there's some potential to hoard cards, so you can try to control the choices of the player to your left. Except, of course, that the start player gets to steal a random card from any player! If you can predict what others will do, though, you can still benefit from the 6VP cards. (You should probably try to keep track of which player has each of these 3 cards.)

Each time I've played, the end has come sooner than I expect. Need to play it again soon, so I can remember this "feature"!

Excellent with 5 players, also works surprisingly well (but very differently) with two.  This has the fun role-selection of Citadels with the scoring tile-placement of Arkadia.  In fact I would much rather play this than Arkadia.  A little tough with the German text on the cards.  Trying to select the right role each turn, but then also worrying about how to place your pillars, makes for a lot of tension and excitement right from the start.  Lots of good laughs as everyone looks around to see who picked which roles for the turn.  A very good game and there's more to it than appears at first glance.  I like how the cards are balanced to the number of players.  Player order is important in both directions: you gain a new card each turn from the right, and you pass your card onto the person to the left.  We had a game where one player didn't understand the value of the Gondoliere and allowed the player on their right to sit on the gondola for many turns collecting points, until finally someone with a spy thought to grab that card from them.  So I'm not saying player order is broken, but it is important for all players to keep an eye on what is going on (another reason this game is slightly deeper than it appears).  Works well with 3 players.  Don't let someone sit on the gondola too long, and make sure you have a pillar marker in reserve to move to it.  The Spekulant can score big if used at the right time.  I can see this being rated a 10 for me if it holds up to a few more playings because it scales well in the number of players, there's so much player interaction, there's just enough building to balance the cardplay, it clocks in at just over an hour, and it looks great.

I really like the action selection mechanic and the delicate balance of trying to share points with all the other players.  The game almost seems too short and I think the end game drags a bit because the person who's winning wants it to end, but may not have the cards and the people who don't want it to end won't play the column builder cards. 2007/01/24

Solid German family game with interesting card play and a good level of player interaction. There is simultaneous action selection, but with 5 players you can reasonably estimate which cards are going to benefit you that round.

Quality components round off this attractive package (even though I am not too fond of the artwork). Liked it quite a bit!

GOLDSIEBER's big-box-game 'Die SÃ¤ulen von Venedig' (The Columns of Venice) by Christian Fiore and Knut Happel gives 2 to 6 players of 10 years and older the chance to relive the emergence and development of Venice to the famous city on columns in about 45 to 60 minutes.

The players place wooden columns on the initially empty gameboard depicting the lagoon of venice and mark their columns with tokens of their colour. Buildings and squares -the districts - are placed on the districts to garner victory points. Anyone building on other players' columns will provide them with victory points. The coveted place on the big wooden gondola will earn victory points anytime a district is build alongside the Canale Grande.

By using action cards the players embody one of 11 venetian characters. Columns are built with pitch-dippers (Pechtunker), councilmen provide adequate supply of districts, which are build with master builders, spies deliver insight into other players' action cards, saboteurs remove districts, merchants and speculators benefit from other players' actions ......

Each player has a supply of 5 action cards and chooses one each round without showing it to the other players. Clockwise the cards are played and passed down to the next player.

Once all 60 columns are placed on the gameboard, the player with the most victory points wins.

'Die SÃ¤ulen von Venedig' (The Columns of Venice) contains a gameboard, action cards, lots of cardboard pieces and over 100 wooden game pieces.

A surprisingly good Euro where planning and bluffing are both critical.  You can try to gain the points off other player's actions or hope they build on your pillars but you best have a plan to get points elsewhere as well.  I like the card passing mechanism and the blind card play which reminds me of some of the chaotic Blue Box games style of play.  RGG was supposed to do an English version of this but the cards are easy enough to grasp with a translation sheet to where you won't need it after a few plays.  The rules are very easy as well and posted here.  I picked up a German version after getting tired of waiting for the English release which may never come.

The simultaneous action selection can produce unexpected result and interaction, but when there are more than three of the same card in play, it becomes less interesting and sometimes even problematic.  There is no catch up mechanism built-in, so once you start to fall behind, it's unlikely to come back which could make it unfun to play to the end in such a position.

Didn't really catch me. Good components and nice graphics but the game was way too chaotic with 6 player. Perhaps I will give it another try with less players but I was really unimpressed...

It's to Starquest what Advanced Heroquest is to Heroquest: improved rules don't add to the game nothing more than additional difficulty in understanding the rules...

In my opinion, this is one of the classic GW board games. Can be a bit tough for the tyranid player, but this can be fixed by adjusting the force points at the start of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8


This is one of the few 40k universe games that I still sometimes enjoy.  It may be very long but it can include loads of the 40k figures that you may already have lying around very easily and satisfactorily.

Definitely flawed but I am quite content to give it a biased "8".

Nice bits, nice board, fun mechanics.  Must buy for Aliens and Space Hulk fans

Fairly okay game. Liked the old style fluff. There are better tactical space combat games around. More something I'd play for fond childhood memories than because of great game play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I would rate this as the second highest rated miniatures game amongst those  I currently own (which, considering I'm a miniatures game, speaks very highly of it). Despite being an antecedent of Space Hulk, I think higher of it then its progeny because it's an exciting game with lots of variant races without having to have fans create additional rules for other 40k races in order to add variety. Mostly though, the enthusiam comes from the equal strategic emphasis in chosing the "right" units and army before you play the game as much as the tactical decision made in combat. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Being Scouts takes a lot of the "Cool" factor away from Space Crusade, my first exposure to Tyranids and very thematic though
Very rarely got played sadly
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Advanced Space Crusade came along at a time before the 2nd edition of Warhammer 40,000, and its ease of play compared to the 1st edition of 40K, combined with its rules for all kinds of marines, (not just Terminators), meant that my friends and I played a lot of this game.

Once 2nd edition 40K came along we stopped playing Advanced Space Crusade, but I miss it. I think itâ€™s overdue for a nostalgic re-play.

Gives new meaning to the words 'duck and cover'. The acid spitting tyranids are freat. The game can drag a bit, and the combat isn't as face paced as it's predecessor or Space Hulk

Opinion: Spawn of Space Hulk - begs for a crossover.

Will I play it again? Never played.

Would I buy it again? No.

Will I sell/trade it? Have to decide if I want to keep it for the minis. Otherwise - Yes.

Based on WH40k world, similar to space hulk but tried to make more varied.

Id rather play Space hulk.

What most GW fans don't know is this was the intro of the Tyranids... some of the coolest mobs to come out from GW in years.  Fairly good game, basically a upgrade to Space Hulk, but I prefered Space Hulk

Never managed to get hold of this as a teenager, but did purchase a set of the cardboard floorplans from the GW mailorder shop for use with Space Hulk. I finally got an actual copy of this off eBay, mainly for the rules. Still haven't worked up the enthusiasm to play it.

Thinner in bits than it's predecessor, but a way more flexible and detailed. Battles are much heavier and monsters more violent. I own a copy with a bag full of extra minis and rules.

RATING: 7
Much better than 40K IMHO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A rare find.  Sort of an attempt at designing a more complex Space Hulk style game.  The problem is it ends up a dilemma of game design.  It loses the simplicity of Space Hulk and requires a fairly seasoned set of gamers to play.  There are rules for every individual character type, meaning it's even more in-depth than 40K, similar to the old Rogue Trader games.  Therefore, difficult for new gamers, and anyone wanting to play something so complex will probably move to a different game.

I find the game unbablanced in favour of the Space Marines, particualrly if you take Terminators or COmmanders. The smaller battles, and limited to only Scouts or Space Marines gives a more balanced game.

Not rated yet, as I've really had no chance to play truly yet.  Tried a couple of solo plays to learn the feel of the rules, then dove into painting minis...  :)  Will try to readdress and rate this if (and when!) I even actually get the chance to play. (This entry will be used for many of these similar games!)

A bit more complex than "Space Hulk" and definitely more complex than normal Space Crusade. This one is a real winner that unfortunately didn't get the support it should have when it was released. Play it with only what comes in the box for the best experience. The exploration and battle system was a welcome change of pace at that time.
They had rules for using terminators and other creatures from "Space Crusade" but I didn't feel it was playtested enough and the balance seemed off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Yet another in my 'seduced by bits' category.  The load of Citadel figs alone seemed to justify the price.  Of course I've only played it a hand full of times...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pointless revamp considering how good the base game was. Rules are ill conceived and not very original for what should have been such an exciting follow up and not enough variety of creatures etc for an advanced game. Components are nice though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ah, who hasn't dream of assaulting a Tyranid bioship ? Well, with ASC, you can! This game is quite complexe and probably one of the best GW has ever produced. The campaign game is quite fun.

RATING: 9
Really Enjoy This Game.  - Bought it from GW back in the golden days then sold and  re-bought from Ebay (wish I'd never sold)

The concept is great. You can fit a small game into an evening or spread a large campaign over several occasions. Various levels of strategy and lots of thematic narrative keeps me engaged, plus I love the reaction system - you don't just stand there and take it when your opponent tries to kill you! 
To get the most out of it you need a variety of extra models (not loads but a variety of them). If you own normal Space Crusade and Space Hulk you have most of them covered. 
Suffers a bit with balance so I now play with a modified version of the rules posted in the Variants part of the forum. Making sense of the rules isn't as hard as some say once you give it a go all becomes quite clear.

RATING: 5
Played one game as aliens and one game as the marines. Although this game (with a little work) had great potential, the idea of "buying" all the Games Workshop miniatures (name used by permission so I don't get sued)turned me off to this one. It's also the reason I've sold all of my Warhammer 40K stuff......it's like a CCG except with miniatures and 5 times more expensive. That's why I sold it for a butt-load of money a year ago.

Man, what were you thinking Jervis?  This is a pile of dog shit and not balanced straight out of the box.  Scouts vs Tyranids...what?  You need to throw in a bunch of your 40K miniatures to get a decent game.

I gave Gee Dubs extra points because My copy was missing one of the boards and they sent out all the cardboard counters and boards again.

I enjoyed this back in the day but I never stuck with it and revisiting it now feels awkward and not up to the standard of the other games from that age (space hulk and necromunda for instance). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well, it is indeed more advanced than regular old Space Crusade, and the rulebook includes stats for all of the figures from Space Crusade and Space Hulk, plus many 40K marine and tyranid figures. Ultimately, though, I think that it sits uneasily between Space Hulk and 40K proper, and you'd be better off playing one of those. A bit too fiddly for the payoff, but a great source of minis.

RATING: 4.2
Unusual game designed to appeal to fans of Space Hulk and Space Crusade.  The excitement is provided by rules for strategic hidden movement and roleplaying elements of the Space Marines player exploring an organic Tyranid hive ship.  As supplied it is fairly limited but improves when combined with models from the other games.  The problem is that as each encounter is resolved via a separate combat minigame it takes a long time to play an invasion to a conclusion.  The rules, whilst flexible and adding interesting events, allies, etc have become too cumbersome.  It is a shame that of the 6 nicely-illustrated gaming boards provided, 4 are a set of 2 mirror section pairs.  ASC leaves me with the impression that it is the simpler minis board games with the more streamlined rules and limited forces that are the most fun to play.

Games Workshop later re-released this as Tyranid Attack with much the same cardboard components, a wider variety of models and rules to suit a simpler, purely tactical game.

Lol this title is awful, and the winner usually only gets like 4-6 points. 

Not a favorite, but a good filler.

A friend kickstarted this and brought it in to play during lunch.  

Our first game was not fast, it should have been faster, but we were learning.  I shot ahead pretty early (good spacial awareness) but it was a pretty close game up until the end.  I was one point behind, and the other two players tied - so the guy who had started in last place, managed to win with the tied-breaker counting.  

I rather like the mechanics of this game - but then, I'm pretty much a sucker for tile-laying games in general.

1st play: Light, Carcasonne style game. More portable, less strategy. Most plays were pretty obvious, and there really weren't a lot of interesting choices in the game. Not horrible but no reason to play again.

Backed the Kickstarter.
A nice change from Carcassonne, but not as good.
It could just be the people I'm playing with, because I really like the mechanic of the game. 
It just doesn't get the buzz around the table to become an excellent game. Hence the low rating. :-(

RATING: 7
This game needs its 3 expansions to be "complete". It's a nice quickie, that satisfies that Carcassonne itch and plays in 15-20 min. When playing, the moves are seldom obvious, so the game creates more "analysis paralysis" than Carcassonne does. Also, I have some issues with the graphic design, which is sometimes good (I like the fences and the overall feel of the game), and sometimes bad (the tokens are badly designed, often creating confusion). The Badges should not be in the player's colors, as they always give the impression you have a bonus icon in the corral. Also, the Miner tokens shouldn't be round, because it creates some confusion with the round blue Hired Hand token. And the scoring track, while a good idea on paper, is really fiddly and sucky. Still, I recommend this game, as it is inexpensive and well-designed.

--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rules:
This is a simple tile laying game where 2 to 4 players take turns placing tiles. The tiles have fences and icons for players on them. You are trying to completely fenced in areas which create scoring opportunity. If an area is completed it scores right away. Players are ranked based on the amount of their icons in the completed area. The 1st ranked player then scores points equal to the amount of icons the second ranked player had in that corral(2nd scores equal to 3rd's icons and so forth.)Players tied for score ranking both score points equal to the amount of icons the next ranked player has in that corral. If a corral is completed with a gold bar, after scoring, that player can move a tile already placed(As long as it's not the starting shop tile, and it is not already used in a completed corral.) Play continues till all the tiles are gone and the highest score wins.
-------------------------------------------------------
I was really excited for this game, and Brad Smith was nice enough to pick me up a copy when he made an order to BGG. I really liked the idea of having to work with people in areas to score larger points.

Unfortunately, my first and only play of this game was tanked and left such a bitter taste in my mouth it never got back to the table. In the game, the tanking player and myself were never really close to the other two players. Brad lead most of the game with Rachel(who was new, perhaps her second week at game nights) a close second. All of us were down to our last tiles, Brad played first, Rachel second, scoring ahead of Brad. I played my tile giving me third place nowhere near them but comfortably ahead of fourth. The last player played his tile to score himself zero points, passing up things that scored him points as well as spots that scored no one points for anyone, and instead scored Brad a point giving him the tie breaker win... It is the worst king making I've ever seen, for no reason, and on a new players head. The guy is an idiot. (Also the same guy from Mafia de Cuba, The Game, Spyfall.)

I honestly don't know if I can rate this game because it'll always be tainted by king making.

Big game in a small box. Well envelope actually as i purchased this through Kickstarter. Love the simplicity of this game but plenty to think about for a simple tile laying game.

This is a big game in an unbelivably tiny package!

Overall I really enjoy this game. However, the scoring mechanics can be alittle on the complicated side to explain. Once everyone at the table wraps their head around it, it becomes a very enjoyable game.

The biggest downside to the game is it's length. It's interesting enough for me to want to keep playing and see how high we can get our scores to go, but being a microgame it ends very quickly. You can always reshuffle and play again though.

The name is hilarious (albeit too big, especially for a tiny little game like this). The components are okay, although the scoreboard is so tiny it makes no sense, so we use pen and paper. As for the game, it is light, it is fun, less random than it looks, but it offers nothing new and at the end of the day, if there wasn’t for the title, this game would be forgettable.

I got this game as a sweetener in a math trade, so I didn't really know much about it, but wow! I am impressed with how much fun is packed into this little game. My wife loves it too; maybe because she really likes the name, or maybe because she destroys me when playing. It's cheap, it's simple, it has a nice visual effect, and the scoring mechanism really promotes interesting decisions; you want to have the most brands in a corral, but to get the most points, you only want one more than next highest amount. I get a little obsessed with going for big corrals, but my wife nickel and dimes her way to victory (as she uses the silver to mess with me).

PnP version on chipboard.  

Review is for the PNP version (for now, mine is color on thick paper as I await Kickstarter version).  I love tile games (eg. Carcassonne) and the interesting rules on this game make it super fun.  It can seem a bit intimidating to new players, but they catch on quick, at least for the basic rules of the print game.  Once the Kickstarter one is available with proper tiles and print quality I'm sure that will be rated even higher for me.  I'm not too sure about the expansions planned, but the basic game is super simple and fun.

Cute little Western themed tile placement filler. I love the design and some of the details on the tiles but I suppose it might be too much like 'Wild West' Carcassonne for some people. Having not played Carc, and loving Wild West/microgame/tile placement games round these here parts I can't say that we are at all disappointed in this game. Maybe I'll finally play Carc and change my opinion but for now this is a solid 7. Great for taking on trips, and the scoring mechanism is neat even if the little score track is a bit fiddly. I have no idea why the score track goes up to 20. Seems utterly impossible!

As much as I was excited about this kickstarter game, we really weren't that taken with it.  It seemed like a simpler version of Carcassonne.  Playing with the Miner expansion dies add a bit more depth to the game, but it was not as great as I was expecting.  This might, however, be a fun game to play with more players (as it was just the 2 of us) or good for kids.

Quick little light tile laying game.  Each square tile has various symbols, with each variety belonging to a different player.  Fences separate areas.  Once you have a completely fenced in area, it scores for each player based on the next-most symbols.  So if the number of symbols in an area is 5-4-2, the player with 5 scores 4, the player with 4 scores 2, and the player with 2 scores nothing.  Might be okay for an occasional filler play.

Deceptively simple microgame from TMG in which you lay tiles to create enclosures -- but the challenge is that points are awarded by the next highest amount of symbols are in there with yours. Bonus options for altering the symbols are included to make the game more challenging.

PLUS: portable, easy to learn, strategy required, options available
MINUS: scoring tracker is too small, game pieces don't fit in the envelope and the rulebook doesn't fit in the baggie

Another TMG microgame. I almost backed this one but figured I'd hold off, and I'm glad I did. I didn't dislike it, but I just have no idea when it would get played. It wasn't so captivating that I would tote a copy around wherever I went, and it's not something I'd regularly bring to game day. I wonder if the recent push for microgames is looking to fill a need that isn't really there.

I picked up This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 Of Us as a cheapo KickStarter minigame from TMG. It’s a simple tile laying game with a few little mini-expansions that add a bit of variety to the game play. The game itself comprises a mere 25 tiles, a scoring track (and markers) and another 12 counters for the expansions. Oh, and the rules, of course. 

The gist of the game is that in their turn each player draws and plays a tile if this causes a corral to be closed off then that corral is immediately scored. The scoring is pretty clever in that each player there scores one point for every ‘brand’ (i.e. player symbol) of the player ranked just below them. That is, if you come first with, say, seven brands, but the second player has only three brands and the third player two brands and the last player one brand the ‘winner’ will score three points, second will score two pints and third one. The last player will never score any points. Also, if there is a silver bar icon in the completed corral then the placing player is able to relocate any other tile currently in play that does not contain a completed coral.

The rather clever scoring system, combined with the possibility of moving non-locked tiles encourages clever play and offers surprising amount of strategic depth in such a small game. This game has delivered excellent value and I have every confidence it will continue to do so for some time to come. Well worth a look.

RATING: 4
Reminiscent of a few others in the genre and not really my cup of tea. The first issue is the analysis paralysis - you only have 1 tile but it can be placed on each spot on the board, and in each of those spots it can be oriented 4 different ways, each with very different repercussions. So that's upwards of 50 placements to work through. Secondly each placement requires you to assess the likelihood of whether other people will work with you to improve their own score in the paddock(s) you expanded, or will attempt to screw you out of a score. So do you try and lock things in for a lower score, or play nice for a mini-group score. Too hard. Your result is highly dependent on what tiles others draw and their inclination to improve together or go standalone. That's a double-whammy of gaming badness that I didn't particularly enjoy. And let's add the stupid fiddly score track to the list of alltime bad component decisions as well.

This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us is a microgame consisting of a small pile of tiles, as well as some extra chits for keeping score.  Each tile has some fences partitioning the tile, and a number of symbols belonging to each player in the various areas of a tile.  On a player's turn, that player draws a random tile and places it.  When a fenced-in area is complete, whichever player has the most symbols in it gets points equal to the number of symbols of the second-place player, and second place gets points for the third-place symbols, and so on.  The game plays in about 15-20 minutes.  While it's not a bad game, there's really not anything to draw players in.  The high luck factor prevents any real strategy.  Think Carcassonne, but not as good.

This is my favorite of the TMG microgames. It's not like coin age where you can play it at a bus stop or something, but it is a small and interesting tile laying game. Think carcassonne, but your meeples are printed on the tiles and your scoring is dependent on other players also getting points.

Surprised how fun this little game is ! For any 2-4 of Us :-)

'FINALE' - ONE MINOR HOUSE RULE (making the game more tense at the end of the game):

After last tile is placed...

1. Each player beginning with player which placed the last tile continuing counterclockwise may place 1 and only 1 token following standard rules (including the option to place miner token and score 1 point). If player has no available tokens, he may not place token at the end (of course)

2. All players can claim points for 1 (and only 1) unfinished corral following standard rules (when player chooses the corral, all players score points for that corral according rules). Silver Bars has no effect at the end. Players choose corrals to score beginning with the player which placed the last tile continuing clockwise. Player has the option to pass (not to choose any unfinished corral).

'FINALE' is our thoroughly tested house rule making the game thrilling right to the end !

21-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Hmm. Carcassonne the puzzle version? In this microgame you try to score the most points by placing and finishing tiles with fences on them. 

If you fence an area in, you look at the icons that are in the fenced in area. Each player present scores points equal to the highest number of icons that is less than his. Imagine, I have 3 icons in an enclosed area and my opponent has 2. I score 2 points, my opponent 0 (as there are no icons lower. There are some additional rules, but this is the basic gist.

Game is fine. One of the better microgames I played, but that said not special enough.

A fun little abstract tile-laying game, involving area control and a pasted-on Western theme.  A bit like Carcassonne but not the same.  Points are awarded based on the next highest player's number of placings.  Very quick to understand and play, but still some interesting strategies.  

Plays 2 to 4 players (obviously), but with 2 players, the dummy player effect sort-of makes me miss the other players.  With more players, though you get less chances to place tiles as the game will only be 8 or 6 rounds (compared to 12).  You can make a bigger and longer game by combining 2 sets, but this might lengthen it too much, as the moves and options are more repetitious than Carcassonne.  

Still very quick, fun and highly portable.  Recommended (except for the fiddly and rather lame miniature scoring track - IMHO they should have used the scoring idea posted by Katja P on BGG ...).

This is Carcassonne the micro game.  The game is played by players taking turns placing tiles with fences and player symbols on them.  When the fences enclose an area the players score points based on the number of their symbols in the enclosed area.  That's it.  I don't care for Carcassonne and this is even more uninteresting than that.

Players take turns placing tiles showing a number of brands belonging to the four player colours and corral fences dividing them into regions. A completed region scores, for each player, points equal to the number of brands in the region owned by the player with the next most (last and tied last get nothing).

With two players this is a tedious Carcassonne-lite but with 3-4 there are some interesting opportunities for collusion (probably best with 3 to allow forcing ties with the dummy brand). The silver bars add a little extra spice by allowing chains of moves.

The expansions are of dubious value, except perhaps the miner.

RATING: 6
Purchased the Kickstarter MicroGame series alongside another microgame, Coinage. This is arguably the better game of the two as Cormier and Lim are veteran gamers and designers.

Town is a melding of tile-placement ala Carcassonne and Schacht's scoring in Web of Power. Players place tiles depicting their own "brand" on the table hoping to win the majority when a corral is completed. Players then score the number of points based on the second highest score or brand in the corral. So, getting a majority without any other brands in the corral amounts to scoring zero points. Three small expansions are included in the game: Sheriff, outlaw and miner which allows you to either mask a brand, increase your majority in a corral or score an immediate point. Those tokens add variety to the game. One can also increase the length of the game by combining two sets of tiles to make it 48 total tiles. This may be necessary for games that involve 4 players. For two players, one set is adequate.

As it stands, comparing against other micro games, Town is decent and stands above the rest of TMG's series of micro games. I'd recommend it as a diversion from your regular gaming schedule or putting the game in the glove compartment in your car.

This is a very solid game - for an unbeatable price. And it already comes with several inbuilt expansions. There is a lot of replayability in this package.

This seems like a nice twist on a Carc-like area control game.  I've only played with my kids who couldn't grok the scoring but I like the potential of needing a decent amount of other people's icons in your zones to score well... which gives them a better chance to take the zone from you.  I'm really looking forward to playing this with adults and adding in the token expansions.

Backed on Kickstarter. Fun game. The markers are a little too big when moving the tiles around. The tiles are tiny so it qualifies as a 'microgame' but I'm not sure that is the way to approach the concept. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating:  It doesn't feel like there's nearly as much control in this as the choices suggest.  The concept feels rock solid, but I think it needs to be realized in a larger game, dare I say it.  That said, it still seems rather interesting to try to control your destiny….

Oh, yes, and the score tracker is horrific, although an interesting idea.  I think it could have worked as magnets, but as tiny bits of cardboard?  Even without sneezes, coughs, or sighs, the minuscule things far too easily lose their position on the scoretrack spine thingy.

I’m not sure about this game yet. It seems to me so far; in two player games there is a complex and deep game here but no matter how you play, it’s a very similar scenario. There are quite a few different shapes that can be played in a variety of ways. Yet 90% of the time its play the shape, move up one. The game is then later lost by a roll of a dice near the end. Four player games put more into the mix but that includes randomness. I need to play this more to really figure it out.

It’s a good game but there can be some down time between turns. I find it difficult to visualise where to put the blocks. I like the fact the dice add a little bit of luck to the game also.

RATING: 7
Kind of like playing a game of checkers where every once in a while the board falls apart and off your table. I like the length of the game and the heft of the pieces.

This game has a little bit of a runaway loser issue, with one player frequently lagging behind with no good hand-hold on the tower, but its not too bad.

Super Jenga with Strategy AND Meeples!  Comes with more pieces than the new version. Both games are comparable in quality, but this one has WAY more pieces.  Plus, you could play "Essential" with this set if you just grab a few pennies for people to use as counters.  This is the one to buy.  More pieces = win.  It's harder to find though.

Awesome fun.  Even if the game were to become stale after several plays for yourself, it would still be an amazing game to bring out anytime someone new comes.  Just watching people play the first time is exciting.

RATING: 6
Not a bad little dexterity game. Players roll dice and add wooden pieces to gradually stack and develop a tower, with the goal of moving your meeple to the highest point. It plays fast, it's pretty clever... not something I need to own but something I'm willing to play.

As a very biased person (I am from Good Company Games), I still love playing this game, even though I've played it probably a hundred times.  Truly a timeless game with simple rules that always provides a new challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to [thing=34297][/thing] but with a dexterity element and a more interesting first few moves. Beautiful to handle and to look at, strategic, and - if you want it to be - viciously cut-throat (which is a plus for me).

KOSMOS printed a version with half the pieces called [thing=86415][/thing] or Turmbauer.

Bought (at great expense) in December 2016.

RATING: N/A
A game that combines dexterity stacking skills with a tactical game of king of the mountain.

Somehow, it works.

RATING: 9
I've only played on a homemade set which, due to the limited precision of home tools, often did not stack properly, or left a block's weight resting somewhere unexpected.

Which was GREAT. As a combination strategy game and dexterity game, this was a total delight. Whether the game as published would make me as happy, I have no idea.

Like Jenga meets Torres lite.  Successful, and lots of ooh ahh factor.  This game rises to a 9 if you get to watch Peter Hendee suck a meeple out of the tower with a straw.

Roll two dice and add the appropriate piece to the tower. Nothing groundbreaking in terms of dexterity games. Just add pieces to the tower and try to place your climber piece on the highest point. Very disappointing.

Block building game very similar to Die Aufsteiger. Dice are used to pick the piece you place and then you move your meeple as high as they can go. Movement is restricted several ways including height, color and a clear path. Has a little bit of a Jenga feel also.

I believe that there are two editions as I understand it.  The 1st edition (2008) has more player components (of each color) than the 2nd edition, which has been re-named "Cornerstone Essentials" (2010).  

This is a building and climbing dexterity game where you want to place your game pieces (one through six) in order to allow your climber (meeple) to ascend to the highest level possible.  Or, simply, just higher than the other players by trying to block them from climbing further up.  It's fun and has a great deal of re-playability so I'm look forward to trying more of advanced rules and variants. There's a good mixture of fun, balance placements, offensive and defensive tactics to use and it's fairly engaging to watch.  It's also eye-catching that non-gamers and gamers alike can all enjoy.  There will be plenty of ohh's and ahh's for everyone involved.

RATING: 7
Takes Jenga to the next level adding a level of strategy to the game. The pieces could have been done much better, but for a small indie publisher it's a really well done game. The value you get for this game is quite high.  If you like a little strategy with your dexterity games this is the one for you.

Totally digging this! I've shown it to about 20 different people and everybody liked it. Also, none of them had ever heard of it before. Of all my games, there is only one that I feel that everybody can/will play... it's this one.

This is a great game!!! If I could recommend one game, it's this. (and Powergrid... um.. and Galaxy Trucker)

Ok, so I'm the co-producer of this game (and designer), but truly, I love it (slight bias...nah).  I have played this hundreds of times and still enjoy it.  Whether I'm demo-ing it or playing with family and friends, I still have a blast each time.  I hope others do (and will) too.

Rating after first play. Overall, not a bad experience--lots of laughing and tense moments. An intriguing mix of strategy and dexterity. I think I was a little put off by the fact that some of the pieces in my bag were slightly uneven - either from the cut or gluing - and because I ended up losing the game due to pieces toppling, I feel like precision cut pieces are actually important to things like balance, etc.

RATING: 8.35
This is surprisingly a great game! At first you think should I get this game...is it just another stacking dexterity game...and then... Well it is intensely strategic, the blocks are top quality and really sturdy! And because of those great sturdy blocks, one game can last for quite awhile...but in a good way! Blocking is one incredible aspect of the game! From an enormously tall structure, someone will be blocked in inevitably...and must come up from the bottom of the structure! You might think he/she would never make it back up...but I have seen several games where the meeple makes it back to the top and is definitely in contention to win! Amazing game!

1 play, rating: 7.

I'm a sucker for a good dexterity game. In Cornerstone, you roll a pair of dice to choose which piece to add to a central stack. Meanwhile, each player has a meeple that is climbing up the central stack in stair-step fashion. When the tower falls, highest meeple wins. The strategy is not deep, but the choices are interesting. There is a nice tense build-up to the fall, but there is a chance one or more players can get locked out of the race. I'd love to pick this up if I can find a reasonably priced copy. Sadly, the chances of that seem slim.

Dexterity coupled with a bit of strategy. The dexterity part is building a tower with three dimensional "tetris" pieces. Each player taking a turn adding to the tower. The strategy is that the winner is determined by who has the highest climber (meeple) on the tower at the time of colapse. Fun!

Another fun abstract.  So far with each group that we have played with, we end up laughing really hard and having a really good time.  Simple instructions, simple gameplay, and seems to draw a crowd asking what the game is and if they can play it.  Not the easiest for young kids though.  This gets a lot of references to Jenga but is nothing really like it at all.

I'm a big fan of area/space filling games (Blokus, Gemblo, Rumis) and this is one of my favorites of its ilk.  Combining building with figure movement to the highest point by climbing steps resulting in catastrophe is such a great idea, and it works so well, not to mention how much fun it is to play. And, the components are really NICE! I love this game.

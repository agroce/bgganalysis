A typical Avalon Hill product - mounted map, sturdy box and functional counters. The game comes with a great set of scenarios (and you can link the two Stalingrad scenarios together with a little bit of fixing), simple IGO-UGO mechanics and some nice touches of chrome - esepcially around headquarters and PanzerKorps / Tank Armies.

I really like this game system very much.  I wish they made more games like this.  Playing the Germans it gives you a good feel for having a dangerously weak front and having to use your panzer divisions as fire brigades.  Had a few stressful games, but worthwhile

RATING: 7
"Classic"-type operational game, but with some significant novelties, such as Reserves and Breakthroughs, which make for very interesting play.  One must carefully plan the location of airfields and headquarters, and properly organize the sequence of an offensive.The drawbacks are minor:  counters get jammed together on the board, requiring nimble fingers.  The scenarios booklet has some hard-to-read diagrams for set-up, and there are some ambiguities in the rules.

I thought that the worst thing about this game would be the map artwork - I was wrong.  The game system is seriously flawed as a study of history (look, Russian tank divisions rushing effortlessly around in 1941!).

This not a game for playing, this is a game for laying down and avoiding!

Bought this when it came out, and I recall that it was a good game, but the hexes were way to small for the counters.  They just needed to be a little bigger.  Again, this looked like a good game, but I couldn't get hooked with this one, so I sold it years ago.

This game is a gem and it is not surprizing it has been republished so many times: RAND, OSG, AH, and CoSi.  Too many wargames allow the use of a cordon defense.  A cordon defense is bound to fail in Panzerkrieg, you have to defend by use of refused flanks, strong points, counterattacks and above all reserves.

RATING: 5
This game looks good, but doesn't deliver what is promised. The system is quite fine, but the scenarios are not balanced and seem unplaytested to me. Strangely though, I have kept this game, even though the developer - not the designer! - did a poor job.

Update: I sold it, space is needed.

In either the OSG or AH incarnation, for years this was THE game on Army Group South operations in Russia.  For players of Prados's original RISE AND DECLINE OF THE THIRD REICH, the "breakout and exploitation" system was easy to grab onto.  A great improvement over its RAND predecessor, VON MANSTEIN'S BATTLES.  This title provided an excellent overview of the surge and ebb of Army Group South through its scenarios.  Some are better than others and the game is perhaps best played solitaire for that reason.  It was my constant companion as I read through Manstein's LOST VICTORIES.

Excellent scenarios and historical booklet make this well worth the money. The system is fairly complex and requires careful positioning of reserves and air assets. Counters are nice for the 80's, and the player aid cards are good, but the Avalon Hill map's a dog, with some putrid colouring and too-small hexes. Rates an 8 as I've won my most elegant victories in this game !

I really, really wanted to like this game, but was aghast at how it actually plays.  Game does not appear to have been playtested, or someone might have noticed there is a problem.  Bizarre it's been through so many reissues, but when you consider 'Europa' and 'OCS' are fundamentally flawed and have spawned myriads of offspring, perhaps we should be grateful this one was firing blanks.

However, given the many positive comments by others, perhaps now is the time to take another look at this game and (perhaps) reassess it.

I have the Avalon Hill version. It is a fun operational scale game of lower moderate complexity.  Lots of decisions and the game moves rather fast. We had a very good time playing through the scenarios. In fact, we played all of them multiple times, except the last one. 

Although the hexes are a bit small, I always liked the look of the game.

played 7 times. The Avalon Hill map is horrible, the hexes are way too small for the very tall and crowded stacks created during play. In addition, the cardboard map is very tough to keep flat. I've obtained the OSG version of the map due to the slightly larger hex sizes and the fact that the paper map stays flat!
Otherwise, the game play is very interesting and quite exciting.

A fast and fairly simple system and a lot of scenarios adds up to a lot of replay value for me.  I never liked the "subway map" setup lines printed on the map, but other than that my OSG copy was acceptable graphically.  I liked the reserve and breakthough rules and preferred them to the artificial PGG "tear their guts out" second mechanized movement phase.  Some (many?) of the scenarios are unbalanced, but so was the war.

One of the best games for working the defense I have had the pleasure to play. Many years playing this game.  I liked it far more than the Russian Campaign.  May even pick it up again, though not the AH version, as the hexes are too small. I found it plays well solitaire also.

This division level / trace supply system seems well balanced.  Unusual features include a lack of ZOCs for infantry, brutal terrain modifiers, and severe restrictions on exploitation.  The end result has losses and frontal movement about the same as the Eastern Front Series, but with more attention required to battle planning and less to supply.  Attack supply is elegantly abstracted in the leader units.  If you send in a Field Marshall you are in effect sending in the attack supply that typically went with them.

9 single-sitting scenarios.  Each should play out in a long day.

Production quality is good. The only shortcoming is the slightly tight hexes, making factor counting a bit of a pain when conducting adjacent massed attacks.  The issue comes up a lot though due to the need for high odds to make a successful attack in that pesky terrain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not quite sure why this game had so many editions... struck me as a pretty standard late 70s operational game.  Lots of scenarios but I'm actually not that interested in the East Front and since the game doesn't differentiate between command capabilities, they all feel a bit the same.

RATING: 3
I either inherited (by abandonement) or bought (more likely) my copy of Panzerkrieg from a good friend of mine many years ago.  That (by the way) was the first of many second hand game transactions that he entered into:  he acquires games, tries them and then either likes and keeps or dislikes and disposes of them (by sale or trade) pretty quickly.  I am a hoarder of games.  I like owning them, even games like Panzerkrieg which I am never likely to suggest be actually played.

There is not much I liked about this game:  long unbroken lines of stacks of units, covering the whole map area, do not (to my way of thinking) produce exciting games.  The choices available to the players seem to be relatively limited, and largely confined to counting the "right" number of combat factors of various kinds to be applied to each attack, and seeking to move units and apply other assets (like air support) to get to the most efficient set of factors attacking each hex.

I am interested in the campaigns covered by the game - which are underrepresented in wargaming (or at least were until the recent past), but this did not get me too excited.  I confess to not having played it for a number of years as I write this - and I accept that my own ignorance or ineptitude may have contributed to the score I have just given it (which is why I could be persuaded to play it again).  That is not an invitation, by the way.

I have the AH version. I played it quite a lot as a teenager, and it does cover relatively obscure territory, but it just seemed too counter dense and dull.

If you can get over the ridiculously small hexes(AH version) that at times can make the game seem unplayable and the rulebook which clearly does not explain everything, there is a good game underneath.  The scenarios are interesting as is the overall system with good replay value.  If you could rework the rules with all of the errata and issue new maps I think this game could be a real gem.

A really dull game that tries to do to much with to little.  It's one size fits all approach to the different periods of the Eastern front just does not produce a enjoyable game experience.  You could be pushing the counters around other WWII battles and get the same lack of feel.  Kill the monster, Kill the monster!!

I currently own the AH version and have owned the OSG version. OSG version is superior between those two I think.

However, IMHO the game is boring. There's something about it that just makes it a math exercise. Even the reserve rule (which is probably the highlight of the game's systems) doesn't help.

Wish I would have remembered all that before picking up my current copy.

I have the OSG version, counters and map are useable. The biggest bug bear for me is the set up maps and the fact you have these rather long frontlines and a list of units and you can place them anywhere along the front! Now it may be that the access to the Soviet and German data for these periods of the war were beyond reach in 1978 to the designer but that seems odd. Interesting to that the Soviet Divisions are often stronger or on par with German ones.

System is fine, its similar to Kanev, though the scale is different. It works okay. Once you work out a set up the game plays fine.

Good choice for the East Front gamer on a budget. Kind of like an operational Panzerblitz. Covers more than a half dozen operations, nearly all of which have been done in many stand-alone games. Here you get them all in one box. Fairly innovative for it's time, and still plays well. Rules could still use some tightening, even after no less than 5 editions published. I have the COSI edition, only complaint is the map is a bit blurry.

Underneath the strange reserve rules there might be a good game. Dark map and very small hexes (Avalon Hill version. This is a game I keep because I want to like it. The overall premises are great. Having a lot of relatively simple scenarios for Army Group South operations. Unfortunately, I never really liked the combat system. The leader rules are strange as well. I have no idea what it is supposed to simulate. Probably some kind of Hollywood version of the impact of leadership.

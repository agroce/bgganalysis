RATING: 7
1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Quick, light play, but lots of options and big action combos. Many different cards to choose from was interesting. I like the long train of cards and figuring out when to upgrade. Possible for a small amount of player interference by depleting a row early.

DISLIKE: Some of the cards are difficult to discern what they do. Table hog.

OVERALL: Even though it has similarities to Russian Railroad (same designers), it felt different due to the variety of cards that come out. It's a light, fun game, but does it have staying power? Depends on future expansions. I still prefer RR because it feels that it has more depth.

First Class is an action selection game played over a fixed number of rounds during which you take a fixed number of actions. Each round new, more powerful actions become available and you can gain some extra moves and bonuses to boost your thing. Sounds like a quite traditional family euro, and that is exactly what the game is.
 
There is a nice agony when choosing your actions because you want to execute them in certain order to maximise their worth but at the same time you are trying to shut down chances for your opponent. Moreover, taking an action might also prevent you from taking another one you definitely want. This is because the possible actions spaces are distributed on a few rows and after a certain number of actions have been taken from each row, that row is permanently shut down for the remainder of the round.
 
My biggest point of criticism is that at least I found myself quite often in a situation in which only a few of the actions available was actually beneficial to me. I quickly learned to avoid such situations but at the same time I felt that the game restricted my decisions too much and I felt obliged to follow a predetermined path. Might well be that it was due to bad play but still I cannot fully appreciate this. On the other hand this gives First Class a certain character but it also makes it feel somehow scripted. But for occasional playing the game is just fine.

Definitely interesting and very tight. A card drafting game in which you draft 18 cards, and throw in a few extra shenanigans, but leaves you feeling like you accomplished something. Nice production quality as well. There are lots of choices so player order might not be THAT important, but it also will not change after the first age, the rewards for it are just so much worse than drafting a card and you actually help out players down the line too.

First class disappointment. Just a boring card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Theme-wise, there are things in First Class that don't make much sense.  Conductors wander through the carriages of incomplete trains.  Those carriages are continually being upgraded around them.  The front of the train cannot have finer carriages than the rear.  A train reaches Constantinople as soon as it has a locomotive with a conductor in it, while the progress of your train along a route of land tiles is of no relevance.  

So, First Class is a fairly abstract exercise in light engine building, efficiency and point harvesting that gives everything a thematic gloss of the railways.  I'll forgive that because it is a well oiled machine that speeds quickly to its destination. Plus it doesn't leave you pacing a chilly platform awaiting a long-delayed next turn.   It also presents some nicely angsty decisions about prioritisation  (which sources of vps to focus on, which card to grab ahead of someone else).  The idea of adding two of five modules of cards to the base set each game adds a good degree of variability.

Production quality is decent.  The artwork is pleasing, although the iconography could have been clearer.  The English rules are fine.

Wow, i didnt expect this game to be that good and engaging! Its a card game with alot going on, nice card combinations and also pretty nice flow (scoring takes alot of time yes, but turns are rather fast). For me it reaches the ideal spot, where a game is a brain burner, but the limited options you have in front of you, dont drag the game too much.

I see this game to fit in everyones collection, although it wouldnt hit the table very often.

This is a quick playing engine builder that requires a player keep an eye on longer term strategy as it throws a bunch of tactical decisions in his or her face. Game play, once you are used to the cards' iconography, can be brisk. There's lots to explore even among the first combination of modules, as the various paths change your priorities for card drafting. The extra modules are key to this game in the long term, but I've found some modules are better than others.

Further, this game puts a spotlight on the engine you've built and lets it run three times throughout the game. So, unlike some other games where you slowly build up your engine and release it once with a hopeful flourish, this game let's you enjoy its power curve as you progress through the rounds. This does sacrifice some tension, but most of the tension comes from the card drafting decisions.

One thing to note: as of Oct. 2017, I've never played Russian Railroads, so I'm unsure how derivative this feels compared to that game.

11/16: Surprisingly entertaining. The modules seem like they could give a lot of replay value to a group that got into the game. It still has all of the things I dislike about Russian Railroads, but in a more elegant package.

More fleshed out: I was pleasantly surprised by this. I don't like Russian Railroads, but First Class has a couple of things that raise it in my estimation:

1. It's at least half as long. I don't find engine building to be particularly interesting, but First Class's arc is more compact, amplifying the effects of decisions.

2. The variability of the decks. While I haven't played them, the built-in "expansions" seem to do more than just shake up previous strategy evaluations. It looks like they create entirely new areas of play and strategies. When the majority of interaction between players is in the drafting of cards, it's nice that the cards have built-in replay value.

This game combines drafting, set collection and network building. The draft mechanism especially provides some great, tough choices. The graphic design fits the theme very well and is clearly illustrates your options. One negative is the huge footprint this game takes up. With the amount of "modules" the base game comes with, I think the re-playability is pretty strong. Though additional expansions could help even more.

A very smooth playing action-selection type game where you're scoring points by building up your two trains and expanding your routes. The game is done using cards and each game incorporates two modules out of five the game comes with. This adds quite a bit of variability to the game. There isn't much interaction between players other than choosing your actions but there's some strategy there. This game won't blow anyone's socks off but it's a great medium-weight hour-long Euro game with lots of replayability.

Flo joined us for a run through of this Euro train game. Brian won 157-123-94. I liked this one a lot! Here are some of the things I enjoyed:

- Variable set-up: Having the 5 modules will give replay ability to the game. We used the basic set up (modules A&B). I did look through the other modules though, and they look really fun!

- Various ways to score well. There seems to be a few ways to go for points and still be competitive. Brian went with moving his train with a heavy coin strategy while I went for upgrading my train cars and getting the double up passengers. 

- Easy to teach. Flo tends to lose interest if I take more than 10 minutes or so to explain a game. But she picked up on this quick. She actually wants to play it again 2 player, always a good thing!

- Lots of fun decisions. The cards you can take are all good. Add a route card, move your train, move your conductor, all fun stuff. 

So, definitely a keeper. This is a borderline gateway game and I really think I could teach it to new gamers and they would catch on with no problem. A nice way to end gaming for 2017!

RATING: 8
First Class feels like Russian Railroads the card game and works pretty darn well. There's nothing groundbreaking about it, but a solid game. There are a bunch of action cards each round (for 6 rounds) and each player chooses an action at a time until 3 are done and that's the end of the round. Manage your two trains by adding train cars, upgrading train cars, moving conductors, adding to your train route and moving your train to get bonuses at the end of every other round. I'd happily play this again, but I don't need to play it again.

The game has a nice flow, it is fun to build your tableau. Enjoyable experience, but again as with so many Euro games of this time it lacks interaction. I would like a (gameplay) reason, why the other people at the table are present. Here everyone builds his stuff and thats it. There is a certain, what will everyone take element with the central display. But overall I'd like a more interactive game.

An Essen 2016 release from the designer of Russian Railroads, Trambahn, and many 18xx games. I enjoyed the game as a quick engine builder.

First Class: Russian Railroads the card game. That was my initial reaction when I had the game explained. It shares more than one similarity and after one play I don't know which one I like better. What is impressive though, is that they managed to compress Russian Railroads into a one hour affair without sacrificing too much depth.

I questioned the longevity of Russian Railroads because of limited strategies and variety coming mainly from the order of available engineers. First Class tries to tackle that issue by providing five modules that you choose two of during setup. This is possible because the worker placement board is traded for action card choosing. 

This also means there's more of an element of luck, since action cards are shuffled and made available in batches. Some strategies can be hindered by action cards coming out in clusters so that useful cards get discarded before you have the chance to get them.

Also there's a track (or train in FC's case) less to develop, but it adds investing in end-of-game bonus cards. I have to play it more to know how this balances out.

The game looks good, but it doesn't have the lush and luxury feeling of its predecessor that has cardboard tiles and wooden rails. Expanding your wagons and rail track feels a bit fiddly because it's made all up of small cards and they tend to slide easily.

I should like this game, it's right up my ally with it's basic drafting and engine building. But for some reason, I just wasn't feeling this one as much. Maybe it's the unintuitive feel of the 'ending' of each round. Maybe it's the only 3 cards before wiping cards before 'more cards'. I just found planning anything really strange overall. It was still fun, but probably not something I'd seek out. I also missed that the grabbing of a end game card was a 'free action' rather than a full action, so I neglected to grab those for the first half of the game, but then my opponent did the thing and I was like 'ohhh'. Anyway, it wouldn't have changed how I played substantially. Overall a miss for me. Just don't like the way the rounds feel. But I'd play again if it was the only euro available besides intro-level games.

After multiple plays of this game, I have changed my rating of this game.  At first blush it was a fun game, but playing it a few times showed there were only a couple ways to win and that took some of the shine off the game.  And it really hurts the game in a three player version where two people will be grabbing the same thing.

Russian Railroads: The Card Game

Beyond that, they've taken the worker selection mechanic and replaced it with an interesting action selection mechanic.  

After 9 plays, I'm still not sure if Industry is matched with Vladivostok, but I'm not convinced it isn't.  

also, the expansions included with the game ensure a lot of replayaility.

RATING: 8
Fantastic. All of the crazy point-scoring goodness of Russian Railroads with the versatility (and portability) of a card game, and enough content that it feels like several expansions already come in the core box. Decisions are extremely tough, since you get so few actions each turn, and you always want to do more than you're allowed. Choosing to take a card that is really good for you, or to take another card to deny another player from an even better benefit, can be very tricky. With all of the modules (not all of which I have played yet), this game has some serious legs. Among my favorite card-game Euros.

UPDATE: Some of the modules are better than others, and some are just awful for two players (especially Murder on the Orient Express). Still love the game, but lowering my rating a tad for the uneven content.

RATING: 8.5
1/31/17: Intrigued after 2 plays.  Although the game is short(90 mins/4 players) there seems to be a number of different paths to victory.  A modular system of adding variety to base game,  and obvious opportunities for expansions to add even more,  lends me to think this design will have long legs. (Rating: 8.5)

2/10/17: After 5 plays,  I'm still impressed with the game but have noticed that the final round scoring can really become complicated due to the number of additional actions that can accumulate at end game.  When you factor in the postcard multipliers on route cards,  plus the smart use of coins,  scoring can really drag out per player.   A little anti-climatic considering the crisp game play prior.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very, very similar in feel to Russian Rails - I can't imagine anyone really liking one but not the other, Lots of different levers to pull, which you do by drafting from a tableau of cards. For me, way to abstract and the choices way to complex - the narrative impulse here is basically flatlined. The theming is worse than a paste-up job; it is actively misleading about what the game really is. Minimal player interaction, highly tactical. I'd play it again if others insisted, to give it another try, but I'd actually prefer Russian Rails.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed my first play of this, as there was a fun engine building strategy to pursue, and I'm generally a fan of engine building games. I also look forward to trying the various modules, which will be nice for replayability.

However, my big concern is the replayability once I try all the modules. The beginner set-up isn't very replayable, for example. There are only a couple of strategies to pursue, and the game rewards picking one of them, and just hammering away at it for the entire game with that one singular focus. Trying to diversify seems to be a losing move. So, even in my first game, I started to feel like the decisions became very obvious, as my best move was just to keep hammering the same path over and over again, which indeed resulted in a win. The decision on what to do was made very early in the game, and then it was just a matter of continuing to do more of that thing.

So, overall, I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure about the staying power.

Russian railroads: the card game. Players draft cards to build up their engine through the addition of train cars and subsequent upgrades as well as adding tracks for your locomotive to move on. The cards are placed in three rows each round but once 4 cards from the same row have been taken, the rest of the cards in that row are removed from the game. This leads to some very interesting drafting decisions. The components are well-made and the box comes with a great insert for the 5 modules that come with the game and leading to great replayability. The price point is a bit high for what comes in the box but it is still a very good game.

I liked it a lot better than Russian Railroads. The game has a nice rhythm since basically your only decision is what card to take from the board. But the way that works with rows getting wiped with two cards remaining really allows competition and nuance. Plus, the way money can buy extra actions and how you time that adds another layer of decision making. If you use the train cards, the game has a way of creating ridiculous combos and turns where you have tons of actions stacked, but in a way that is easily digestible since you build it as the game goes on. Much more interactive than Russian Railroads, and much quicker, with some game to game variety. Not bad

A nice card drafting game that like Russian Railroads sees scores jump incredibly in the later rounds as you are able to combo everything together. Moving your train to get bonus actions every other round seems incredibly important and that can drive your conductors and your trains further along. Everything just works so well together and even with just the base A/B modules the game is a lot of fun. I'm interested to try more modules to see how they change the game up. Overall while this game may not receive the same overall acclaim as Russian Railroads it does play quicker and is a bit lighter which for me makes it the better choice.

I liked it, but somewhat surprisingly, the rest of the table just thought it was ok. I ended up growing tired of Russian Railroads, and while one person called this RR Junior, I didn't like how RR had such little variety (other than players making different decisions). This game goes to the opposite end of the spectrum, and not only has random setup (each round), for impossible to pre-plan gameplay, there are also 5 separate modules, of which every game has 2. So that's 20 combinations of modes. But yeah, it's definitely lighter than RR, which although I don't mind long games, is a welcome change, because RR just felt a little long. And after the mini and full expansions, it just felt a bit much.

This was sold to me as a faster, streamlined take on Russian Railroads, which had be intrigued, not to mention the theme. I think RR is quite good, so was curious if I'd like this more and if it would fit the gaming style of my friends. Turns out all of this was true.

While the learning curve here is still rather steep, the gameplay is rapid, and players quickly figure out they don't have a lot of time to accomplish everything they might want to do.

The artwork is great, I like that with five modules you can tailor each game to the players involved which keeps it fresh, and the rules are clearly written. Definitely a new favorite for me.

Played once with modules passengers & luggage and who is the murderer. Can't assess how the other modules work as I have not played those yet. The game is quite alright and both modules do add their own flavour to the game, however the who did it module has one nasty feature: player elimination. If you have the most fingerprints, then you're eliminated from final scoring, which is rather harsh. I played the murderer, so was awarded with additional points as I managed to survive, but two players who has 5 fingerprints each were out of the game as the end. Perhaps a penalty would have been more fair, so that will probably be a house rule next time we play. I did enjoy the game and would like to play again. Thematic not that strong but a fun game nonetheless.

A sort-of card game off-shoot of Russian Railroads. You can feel the similarities, but it's a much different game. The game consists of drafting cards from a face up set and playing them immediately to your tableau, executing any actions caused by doing so. If you play properly you can set up some pretty elaborate turns. It's quick, fun, and can feature a lot of cleverness. There are five different versions in the box as well. We've really enjoyed this one so far. Highly recommended!

Score points by building two trains consisting of a maximum of 10 wagons, by upgrading those wagons and sending your train conductors through the wagons, by building a track and moving your locomotive over it, and by collecting final scoring cards. The game is played over 6 rounds, with intermediate scoring after rounds 2 and 4. Each round players take 3 cards from a display of 18. These cards allow you to place wagons, upgrade wagons, move your conductors and locomotive, build your track, take final scoring cards from a display of 4...

An obvious spiritual successor to Russian Railroads.  Lets me get that RR vibe with players who might not be ready for the depth of RR.  Mix and match modules and shuffled decks of actions make each game very unique (something RR lacked).  Plays very quickly, but still lets you feel like you've built something up.

The comparisons to Russian Railroads are spot on. In both games, you're upgrading your locomotives and receiving bonuses as you travel along a route or routes. Also similar is the slow economic engine build-up with explosive growth on the last turn or two.

Lovely card drafting, points engine building card game themed on the Orient Express.  Plays very cleanly but constantly throws up tough choices at the players.  The addition of 5 different modules to mix into the card deck, essentially allowing for 20 different deck mixes, is excellent.  Expansion decks ... bring them on.  Excellent, polished game - as expected from Hans im Glück.

Caveat: I have only played the basic module.  First Class is a clever Euro game.  It shares a little with its cousin [thing=144733][/thing], particularly the way points escalate rapidly in the end-game.  And herein lies the issue with it for me: those end turns get rather complex, and with the various paths you can take and triggers you can release, the turns can take a long long time.  With four players the downtime in the last round is looooong.

First Class is a game which is clever, and I appreciate the clever design, but I really do not love it.  It feels a little soulless.

RATING: 8.2
Excellent, tight, well balanced, relatively short (1 hour) game that offers immense quantity of tough decision making. Theme is weak though and about building train composition and railroad using cards drafted publicly from the tableau in a clever way. There is plethora of variations and possible paths to victory and it has 5 modules from which you choose 2 for near unlimited replay-ability. 

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Building railroad which gets more powerful bonuses at the end of very round the further your locomotive went.

This is an excellent train themed action selection game. The decisions are tough and provide great euro-style player interaction. The combos and engine-building are rich and strategic. Included in the base box are 5 pluggable modules (you use two at a time) that add variation in strategy and play style making each configuration different. Play moves quickly and keeps you engaged. This game is flying completely under the radar. Fantastic!

RATING: 8
First Class is basically Russian Railroads The Card Game. It's made by the same company (thus, having a similar look), one of the designers of RRR made this, it has a train theme, and is very much an explosive economic engine with some similar mechanisms. How does First Class differ? 

-Instead of worker placement driving the game, there is a unique pool-drafting mechanism. There will be 3 rows of 6 action cards and each player will draft 3 cards per round. When a row has cards taken from it equal to the number of players, the rest of the row is discarded.

-First Class comes with 5 modules. Each module has unique mechanisms. Each game you will use 2 of the 5. This gives the game a lot replay value. It's not perfect though. The murder mystery module is not a good module for 2 players. There are two modules ("doublers" and "passengers") that compete to add things to your train, making it better if these two aren't included together (imo).

-Money management is very unique in this game. I'll leave you to look into it yourself.

I think one could own both RRR and FC. FC could be used as a stepping stone to RRR. First Class, being a card game, does have a lot more luck than RRR. Overall, I think this is a great mid-weight euro that plays quickly and has a ton of variety. I could see some people even preferring this to RRR. Especially, when you consider it has more variability out of the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We have both, but if pressed to select between this card game and the not-unrelated board game, First Class would win.  Some reasons:-

+ Card drafting is fun
+ FC is shorter and basically focuses on key scoring elements 
+ RR expansions are expensive, so more game in the base box
+ FC includes some pretty good variants in the core game, by mixing in different decks to enhance replay value
+ Various scoring routes seem really well balanced

Insert is both functional and has space for lengths of sleeved cards (not width, but put X-start cards in another section, so works fine).

RATING: 7.5
An action drafting game with a seemingly robust set of victory point paths. There are six rounds of three actions each, but the game is in squeezing out extra actions via card effects. These effects may chain, and the fun is setting yourself up for a chain of actions in a turn. Everyone is saying how similar to Russian Railroads this is, but it reminds me of Grand Austria Hotel in this regard. 

You start out rather anemic but quickly become pregnant with bonus actions and possibilities. Actions are taken via a draft of three actions per round. There's a bit of luck in how the action cards come out, but overall I didn't feel it decided the game. Since you score on the 2, 4, and 6 rounds, you have an extra consideration for which actions to in those rounds. The action cards you select go into your discard pile and score for the icons on them at game end. 

There are different ways to go about specializing in VP production, and the game comes with different modules of action cards for variety in play each game (though I've yet to try anything other than the basic A and B sets). 

I liked it and thought it was one of the better medium weight games I've played.

2017-03-08: "Russian Railroads - The Card Game".
There really is a LOT of similarities. The rampant scoring, the 'build track/trainset and move scoring marker ahead', the 2x markers, the "additional track" i.e. industrial/railway.
The big difference seem to be the amount of variety and randomness.
This might have more variety than RR but it also ABSOLUTELY has more randomness.
Also I am SOOOO NOT A FAN of cards that are strictly worse than others!

A good game, but I still prefer Russian Railroads with the German expansion (with brings a bit more variety) I think. 
Initial rating = 7

RATING: 6
1x 3-player game @Spiel'16 (Schmidt booth)

It's pretty much "Russian Railroads, the card game". The trains are the tracks and the tracks are the industry, etc., etc. pretty much works the same. Streamlined and simplified, shorter, somewhat more casual, quite well designed all in all. Less tension on the action selection, but some tough choices are still there. The components are good quality as always with HiG, but Menzel "rokoko" style makes it less legible that it should (as always with Menzel). Anyhow, a decent game and that's it. 

It is quite possible that the diverse "expensions" modules (included in the base box) allow for nice replayablity and add some depth or chrome (there seems to be a "murder" scenario in the pack for instance).

Had a surprinsingly enjoyable time playong it. After a single play, it seems obvious that having weak competition on your main axis is crucial, while the secret objectives are quite anecdotic in terms of scoring. Wonder if that changes with more experencied players.

Might get it when/if it reaches the 10/15€ price range.

RATING: 7
Fast and easy to play enginebuilder. In my opinion played best with 2 players and without starting tile. I also think it is not as balanced as it could be. Module D for example (tourists & Luggage) is neglectable when played with module B. Further more collecting conductors and 'end of game-conductor cards' seems like a very powerfull combo. Still, I enjoyed my plays so far.

Would play this over Russian Railroads as I get the same feel for it, but it is shorter.

One of the downsides is that, like RR, you have to ignore part of the game and only focus on 1 or 2 things, that way you can maximize your points.  Trying to do a little of everything is a recipe for losing.

While it was an okay game, I don't really care to play these types of euros more than once, meaning ones where there is a whole bunch of action cards that let you do resource conversion, etc.  The theme in those doesn't seem like it as fully realised as I would like.

RATING: 5
A blatant example of how, when a designer gets a huge hit, his other games are taken in consideration.
This games has the same exact mechanics of Russian Railroads, but it's not a worker placement game, just an action selection.
I thought that the only "funny" part of RR was the snowballing effect, and this game doesn't add anything new to RR, having most of the same concepts inside. Same snowballing, same mechanics, same theme. The designer was a bit lazy, wasn't he?

Kár, hogy nem ez volt előbb, így kicsit eltűnik az RRR árnyékában.

While quite different from Russian Railroads in terms of mechanisms used, First Class still manages to feel rather close to its big brother even though it only takes a fraction of the time. That's quite a feat, I think. The card game also has a bit more variability which hoepfully won't make it go stale quite as quickly. What hasn't changed in any way is that it's all about rolling the biggest, baddest snowball in sight, only you've got less time than ever.

I am not a fan of the graphic design which often makes cards unnecessarily hard to decipher from a distance.

Eine Genmanipulation von RUSSIAN RAILROADS als Kartenspielmeer, wohin man blickt. Nach 18 Zügen pro Spieler, in denen man an zwei Zügen und einer Eisenbahnstrecke baut, ist die etwa einstündige Fahrt mit dem Orient Express auch schon wieder zu Ende, wobei vom Abenteuerflair in der Subline nicht viel zu sehen ist: FIRST CLASS ist ein glücksspielfreies Optimierspiel wie es optimieriger nicht sein kann. Bauchspieler brauchen in den Zug nach Rechenland erst gar nicht einzusteigen. Das Verhältnis aus Spielzeit und mittlerer Komplexität ist das größte Plus des Spiels, das RUSSIAN RAILROADS als interaktive Multiplayer-Kartenpatience adaptiert. Mir persönlich bleibt bei aller redaktioneller Perfektion FIRST TRAIN zu hirnig, rechenschieberhaft und kalkulativ.

A card drafting train building game, similar to russain railroads. Uses a unique drafting system and every game you use 2 different modules, adding those cards to the stand cards. After 2 drafting rounds, there is a scoring phase and there are 3 scoring phases each game. Cards come out in a predictable manner as they are separated out by 1/2/3 phase cards and almost all will come out but not quite. So you can be confident in knowing what will come but not 100%, great for replayability

The game is very satisfying with lots of tactics and strategy, along with variability. Short play time for a game of style is great too

Based on yucata plays:
The game is (as I suppose) more forgiving than Russian Railroads and more diverse, but is as spread-sheet-excely as the older brother. I quite enjoyed it (and it also seemed more streamlined and quicker).
And it allows you or even pushes you to make combos in a very satisfying way. I like it and would love to own this little funny excel... but in better price than available in Poland.

And after some more plays it feels like RR - you kind of seen everything in very few first games and what you are left with is optimization. Solo optimization. Not particularly exciting. Rating goes down to 6.

Nice drafting game. My initial impression is that there are 2-3 legitimate paths to victory.

I don't love how much of a snowball the game proves to be. Most of your scoring happens in the third (and final) scoring phase. These phases can get rather long as well, given that all of your combos will likely trigger at this point. I would prefer that the combos and scoring were spread more evenly throughout the game.

That said, I love drafting. I enjoy trying to put together sets of cards that will work well together. I like that I can't do everything, meaning I have to make tough choices about what to focus on.

I thought, "Did somebody play Russian Railroads and conclude that all themeless, point saladish, kinda sandboxy but not really, Euros had to be about trains now, and then design this?"

The answer is no, somebody designed Russian Railroads and then designed this.

Looking at the rest of his designer page, I think he might just be personally into trains.

This game offers a lot of opportunities for insane chaining and combos, which are super satisfying to carry out. The components and artwork are great, though it takes up more table space than you would think. It plays quickly and is a lot of fun, and creates tense decisions because you have so few actions. You always feel like you need to do so much more than what you're doing. I really like this feeling in games, but the really quick play time and the limited number of actions (you only have 18 actions in the whole game - 3 each round and there are 6 rounds) can feel restrictive. Good, solid game though in my opinion.

Helmut Ohley seems to be making a second career out of designing these Euro train games. This is even more abstract than Russian Railroads while making less thematic sense. Why do you score points for your conductor moving down the train? More troublingly, like RR this is a pure snowball, there's no catchup mechanism, so the relative position of the players doesn't change from first scoring round to last.

Slightly dry and mechanical, yet there can be exciting opportunities to collect the proper combination of cards to score piles more points than your opponents. This can be a lot of fun if you like mental arithmetic type games. It almost pains me to say this, but I want themeing that is executed better than First Class has accomplished here. So what, your train is longer than mine. My conductors are further up the train than yours. Yawn. I want an underlying idea about what I am doing in the game to be more exciting than this. So is it better at theme than Splendor? Sure. Is that really going to be our standard? I hope not. Are there multiple interesting paths to victory? Definitely, you got me there. I can't argue that. How much fun is First Class? How eager am I to play this again? Meh.

I'm not exactly sure how I felt about this. It's certainly Russian Railroads: The Card Game, and I think the way it does cards improves on my main problem with Russian Railroads, which was that every game felt the same. Even without there being a handful of different modules I think just the cards coming out differently should hopefully shake things up enough, though I guess I can't know that after only one play.

But also some of those different modules seem much more interesting than others, in particular I'd like to have tried the one where the cards do different things depending on which track they're on, it felt like the two tracks weren't distinguished enough. But I really wasn't a big fan of the doubling cards, I'm pretty sure that the ranking in our game corresponded exactly with how many of those you ended up getting, they were just worth so much more than anything else.

It's possible there's more luck than I'd like, but for the length of the game I think it's within acceptable levels. It also has that Russian Railroads thing where if you do something no one else is doing you'll be at a huge advantage, and that's not something I generally like. But I did really enjoy the way coins worked, I thought that was pretty clever and interesting, and I think that if you get the right train cards then you can do some cool stuff chaining stopwatch bonuses together. And overall I'm still thinking about the game and want to play it again to try more things, so that's a good sign.

2017-02-13 - I can definitely see why this game gets called Russian Railroads: The Card Game. It has a lot of similarities. I like the variety that the different decks provide to gameplay. The game seemed a little but swingy, but was still fun.

Lovely game! I very much appreciate the coin system, which combined with the route bonuses makes for some great feeling combos. The card drafting is a nice, tight design choice that provides everyone with a lot of great choices that quickly dwindle as rows are removed. 

I am not yet sure how important turn order is, but it seems quite important, which I usually have some distaste for. However, my first play of this left me happy and wanting more. Looking forward to checking out the other modules. 

Great components, art, insert, etc. All around a great production!

Felt little desire to play this anymore. Sold.

This is supposed to be the card game version of Russian Railroads, but it has been so long since I've played the former game that I did not find it all that similar - but I could just be forgetting. It certainly does not feel like a board game being replicated entirely with cards (looking at you, The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game), which allowed me to learn, play, and enjoy the game on its own merits. 

Players draft action cards from a central display in order to accomplish a few different things in their personal tableau: grow the number and value of rail cars for two trains, build and travel a rail line for points and bonuses, move conductors along your trains so more of them score, and collect money which can be spent to advance in all of these areas as well. The game comes with 5 modules in addition to the basic one, only 2 of which are in any given game. Picking the modules changes your actions and focus for each game, providing a bit of built-in variety and an easy way to expand game play with small decks of cards. It's largely a game of tactics and opportunity with a satisfying sense of accomplishment as your tableau grows. Some people say there is a dominant strategy, but others say it is an illusion that fades with more experience. I guess I'll have to come to my own conclusion down the road...

RATING: 7
Recognizably the card game version of Russian Railroads. Each game, two of five modules are selected and shuffled with the base cards for a total of 10 different setups giving individual flavor and variety. Three sets of two rounds are played. Each set, 18 cards are revealed, each round players draft three of the cards to their display. After each set, a scoring takes place. Plans have to be formed based on the card selection. The draft gets increasingly tense towards the end of each set. Money-based free actions complement the game.

Players can put focus on expanding the track or upgrading their train. Secret goal cards support secondary considerations of improving the own board via certain types of cards. Contrary to Russian Railroads, a monofocus doesn't seem to be viable. Specifically, expanding track grants powerful effects for each of the three scoring phases. The postcard module we played might have reinforced the importance by doubling selected effects.

I'm surprised that an experienced company as Hans im Glück commissioned an artwork hampering gameplay. The design is so busy that it's difficult to discern the different types of cards. The cover doesn't appeal, either. A good game, not as great as Russian Railroads. Its advantage is the shorter playing time.

Tries to portray itself as Russian Railroads: The Card Game and there are definitely similar elements. But this is definitely a game of its own consisting mostly of tactical card drafting from randomized open table and that works prettily. The most exciting mechanism here is the money management system while the mechanical pitfall lies within the easiness of adding and upgrading your railroad cards.

Cool, simple, straightforward. Offers different paths, or a mixture of two, and the modules bring a different experience every game. Modules are not as out there or different as I hoped they'd be, and the Murder one is honestly pure turn-off for me.

First Class feels similar to Russian Railroads in many regards: The theme is nice but not really important. You take actions by taking cards making them unavailable for the other players (unless there are duplicates in the display) and try to set up your engine to get points which will usually involve some serious snow balling. But the short playtime and amount of variability added by the various modules you can use, manage to set it apart and help to justify owning both games.

Great game. Fulfilling and thinky gameplay while playing in barely any time at all.

Main mechanics are a mix between drafting and tableau building with very limited actions per round. In fact the entire game was only... 18 actions?
Also easy to explain/teach.

Nice graphic design and artwork, even if there isn't all that much of it.

Overall this is game falls somewhere between Good and Okay.  Gameplay seems balanced as I think no one strategy will be dominant.

SOLO PURGE?
This is a funny little game which does just enough to stay in the collection. It's as abstract as its parent, Russian Railroads. You're adding carriages to two trains, upgrading them and sending conductors along the trains for intermediate scoring. At the same time you're building an abstract route and sending a tiny engine meeple down it. You have two lots of 3 actions per turn and 3 turns in all. So you do 18 things in total each game. Not enough. You take actions by selecting cards from the market. Clever use of cards in modules increases replayability. Scoring is tight. It makes for a light solo game that isn't too much of a table hog. Plus the insert is actually useful. But it all adds to less of a game than the size of the box would indicate. Keeper, for now.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Another of just a few favorites from Essen 2016. This captures the feel of Russian Railroads the Card game but is quite unique in and of itself. In addition, the five different modules allow for a different feel in the game in almost every experience. I'm not certain all modules will be favored - IE, the Orient Express murder mystery is not likely to be a favorite with one person automatically losing if they have the most fingerprints at the end of the game a la Cleopatra/corruption tokens. One only has 18 total turns in the game although coins can grant bonus actions so planning ahead is vital. There are a number of ways to score. I do believe this game takes up more space than the board game!

Fascinating card driven follow up to Ohley's Russian Railroads which shares a similar theme, opportunities for chained combos and potential for explosive scoring in later rounds. Several included expansion modules vary game plays, and hard to find external minor expansions bring additional scoring opportunities.

Nice surprise. Acclaimed similarities with Russian Rail Roads kept me away from this game, but that was stupid, because this is a very different, much lighter, game that doesn't take to long. Everybody has only 18 actions.  So optimizing your moves is crucial. The different decks in the box give enough variation to keep on enjoying this very deep but simple game to grasp.

I have only one problem with this game and that is the abuse of the theme. Yes you come in the atmosphere of the theme through its material, but the mechanics don't match the story of the theme.

Don't have much of an issue with the game, but I am not excited to play it as well.  It's like a Honda Civic: It works as intended, nothing more, nothing less.

I won't pretend that I know the balance or the strategies around the game in playthrough, so I won't talk about that.

The entire flow of the game felt like a worker placement game where the areas constantly shifting from round to round in three separate phases.  The rules are very easy to learn and there are various ways to approach the game with it's numerous ways of scoring.

My only gripe is the game can go into AP mode, especially in the scoring rounds, because you have to calculate various factors to get the highest score possible.  If you don't do this, expect to lose by a large margin.

First Class is a game that works and I can understand the love for the game, but it isn't the most exciting or interesting game either.

No longer interested. Still not sold on Russian Railroads and this is supposed to be a card game version. A video review (with a pleased reviewer) did not at all impress me. Guess I am not interested in point-salady train-ish games that are not really economic games.

Update:
Played today and would agree that it is well designed and should appeal to people that like action efficiency with a side-dish of point salad. In particular, the ability to do one really explosive turn is interesting. Would not mind another round, but it is not something that I would suggest.

The beautiful art and cute little cards make this a pleasure to play. I love the speed of play, the limited number of turns--it's all about squeezing extra actions out of combos, as you're confined to 3 cards over 6 turns. A lot more sandboxy than Russian Railroads, and also with a big luck factor, though smart play should mitigate that to some extent. I've not tried the one wacky module (C, the hidden-role mystery module), which probably is pointless unless you have 4 players since it'd be anticlimactic to find out that NO ONE is the murderer.

UPDATE: I've slightly downgraded the rating for this one, because it seems less sandboxy than I'd hoped, especially in 2 and 3 player games (in 4-player games it's harder for a single player to monopolize the best cards). The basic issue is that pushing your conductors to the locomotives is considerably better than a strategy focusing on laying down train track--the powerful combination of contracts, conductor cards, money, Constantinople bonuses, and high-point conductor endgame bonuses is usually going to edge out a train-route strategy--the latter can score well but needs to be pursued relentlessly and is very fragile, as it depends so much on snagging a single card (the station giving 2 points per station), and has no chance of making up lost ground with bonus cards. So the whole game can be quickly tilted heavily towards conductor movement and cards, if the initial bonus card draft and four-card offer on the table contain several conductor bonuses. (The bonus cards for train movement and car upgrades are fairly irrelevant by comparison--they score poorly and you must in any case not focus on collecting the matching cards but instead get train stations, contracts, and switches/mechanics.)

This is Russian Railroads the card game and it condenses that game down to about an hours runtime.
In this game you select cards from a grid and use them to:  build trains (which then need a conductor moving along the carriages to score points); build track ( which you the move a train along to score points) or scoring cards.
The game plays well and anyone who wants a shorter games than the board game will enjoy it. It has the same high game end scoring as its predecessor.

Definitely feels like the evolution of this designer's Russian Railroads engine, but somehow manages to be lighter,  faster, and have more variability. That being said, I don't think this game is perfect. It feels a little lacking in the combos department, as most of the time you're just selecting and carrying out a card. At the same time, the ceiling of this game is much higher than that of Russian Railroads. Someone who is experienced with the game is going to do better than someone who isn't. The different modules are a nice touch, but even with the basic ones I'd say that First Class has a good amount of variety right out of the gate. 

I'm excited to explore the other modules, and they may end up raising my rating as a result. Time will tell. As it is, this is definitely one of the best games I've come across in 2017. I wish there was just a little more to it with the actions you take, but it still gives me that same satisfying feeling that other creative card games like 7 Wonders Duel do. Also, the way rows disappear as cards are taken is a really neat little mechanism.

From the designer of Russian Railroads, comes another railroad game that is card driven.  From three rows, players choose a card to implement the action: move your locomotive, move your conductors, add cars, upgrade cars, select end game bonus, etc. You will be choosing three cards per round, and the game lasts 6 rounds, with a scoring rond after every second round. 

This game is  a lot of fun. When you are getting a card, you worry about leaving behind a good card for someone else. You are racing to get your conductors to Constantinople, and also trying to expand your routes on the locomotives. There are lots of things to think about. 

You play with 2 modules at a time. I have tried 3 of the modules. The E modules adds switches and mechanics which affects between cars or between trains. I like the variety that the modules add. It's fun, and there is some depth that takes some time to uncover. I look forward to playing this game.

Very much a spiritual successor to the excellent Russian Railroads, although worker placement has been replaced by card drafting. The game still is a point salad that revolves around scoring bonus actions, so it scratches the same itch, even though it plays more quickly. Because it's a card game, it's a bit fiddlier than I would like, and it is a table space hog, but this is deeper than it first appears and is filled with tough decisions almost every turn. Good stuff.

Surprisingly quick. Non-intuitive to learn from rulebook but once I saw a couple of videos everything made sense. It seems to end before you want it to end, making it feel more like a thinky abstract than a train-building game, and a huge reason why is that you only get 18 cards throughout the whole game, so there cannot be any wasted action or you fall behind.

Intriguing. Played with A, B and D so far. C deck sounds so bad that I'm likely to avoid it completely.

The box insert is strangely designed only halfway through: there are slots for every  (sleeveless) deck but nothing to actually lock the decks in place once the box is closed.

Gioco molto carino e veloce. Semplice da apprendere e padroneggiare ma non ovvio. Offre qualche aspetto strategico e risulta comunque un gioco gradevole anche per la sua semplicità e immediatezza oltre che per velocità e frizzantezza. Una piacevole scoperta.

I'm not sure about this one yet. It propagates a lot of actions with very few decisions, especially with 2P. The art and iconography aren't the best, and the money rules don't really make any sense. I like the flexibility afforded by the expansions, though, so it's definitely worth some more tries.

[b]First Class: Unterwegs im Orient Express[/b] 

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]First Class has been one of the biggest surprises from 2016 in terms of how much I enjoy the game and the fact that my kids and folks in my game group all enjoy it. I think one of the biggest pluses for the game is how quickly it plays for a mid-weight Euro; a 4p game will easily wrap up in an hour. This makes First Class the perfect opener on a game night. Based on how the draft works and the limited amount of actions you will have during the game, you will never be able to get everything you want. You are constantly forced to reevaluate your plan and make the best out of what is availiable to you. First Class offers a very satisfying puzzle to figure out and each game will play out differently based on how the cards come out each round and which decks you are playing with [i](there are 5 and each game you choose 2 to use)[/i].

First Class has become one of my favorite mid-weight Euros that is easy to teach and plays in an hour [i](joining games like Palaces of Carrara and Stone Age)[/i]. First Class is another game on this list that I would highly recommend, it has stood up to repeated play and still a game that I look forward to playing. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This one is going to be tough to write up since I only got one play in. My initial thoughts are very favorable and I can't wait to play this again. 

After one play and can say that you need to be focused from your first turn since over the course of the game you only get 12 action. There are 6 rounds and each round you draft 2 cards and execute the action associated with that card. There is the opportunity to squeeze out a copy of bonus actions, but time is not on your side in this game. After playing once I feel like I have a better idea of how to improve upon the decisions I made. There are multiple ways to score points and every avenue seemed viable, there doesn't appear to be a golden path to follow. 

My favorite part of the game is how card drafting is handled. There are three rows of cards to choose from; however once the the number of cards taken from a row equals the number of players the rest of the cards in that row are tossed, which adds a bit more tension to how you draft cards. You can definitely effect what other people want to do based on how you manipulate the draft, which steers this game away from being a multiplayer solitaire experience.

It will be interesting to see how my thoughts evolve over the next year, I have a feeling First Class will see a lot of play in my house in the coming months.[/i]

額外可以有行動的機會大概就火車軌鋪道6跟10個時
上面路線雖然可觸發多的行動但是最多也就三次，越晚放越不划算
四塊錢買的獎勵行動也很弱，主要是為了上面的最後計分
最後計分又傾向專注於特定動作
所以可能路線固定時分數會較高

I've been vacillating on whether this will turn out to be an 8. You claim an action card from the draft to expand cards in your tableau, to improve cards in your tableau, or to move markers along cards in your tableau to gain advantage. There's lots of ways of scoring points, including immediate points, fulfilling contracts/quests, end-of-game bonuses, and first-past-the-post points. You might only get 18 actions, but it's one of those games where you get lots of bonus actions from achieving things, so you're trying to set up to take full advantage which will take replay to master. Different strategic approaches offer replay. Different sets of action cards offer replay. But essentially it's a drafting game, and drafting cards for 60-75 minutes is a long drafting game. It kept my attention though, and I'd like to play more, but it felt like another in a long line, which meant it lacked a certain level of exploration excitement. But it does do drafting very well and I'd be happy to play.

After a few plays: 
This is a great game. Usually games where "actions" are a bottleneck doesn't really agree with me, but this has an aspect that I do like a lot: the scoring model. I like that more than half the game time is scoring, and you do more actions during scoring than between scoring. The combinatorics in scoring is complex, which also suits me. 

I usually end up with the strategy collecting as many conductor cards and corresponding end game cards as possible and that's it. Last time I played I scored 160 points only from that: 8 conductors times 4+4+3+3+3+3=20 points from end game cards. 

Of course this was a three player game, with less competition over those cards, and I started as last player, getting to chose the first end game card first. And none of the other two showed any interest in conductor cards, and there were already two more conductor end game cards available. But I still see this strategy to be very strong. I have not won before, but I have always been only a few points from the winner, both in three and four player games.

This is a card based track building game similar to Russian Railroads in premise and also a little in feel. It works just as well with the card mechanics as with the worker placement mechanic. You select cards and create railroads and move your conductor along them to activate benefits. It is a game of medium complexity and can be played in about an hour. If you like the bigger games this one is well worth a try as you get a similar feel.

First Class felt a little like Russian Railroads the card game, which I think may have been the intent. Players draft action cards from a display, and these cards can do things like add new train cars to a player's two trains, upgrade the train cars to higher point value ones, move the conductor pawns down the trains, get new track maps with bonuses at various points on the map, or advance their train pawn on the track map. At the end of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th turns, a scoring round occurs--you get miscellaneous bonuses as printed in the cards for your train pawn depending on how many bonus spaces you've reached, and the train cars score their value if the conductor pawn has reached that car. Like in Russian Railroads, later scoring rounds eclipse earlier ones in amount scored, so the game really accelerates. This game was pretty easy to learn and play, and actually has a lot of strategy for its short play time.

This is a marvelous tableau building card game, where players take 3 turns drawing an action card from the center area and then resolve it. The general idea is that each player has two trains and a train route they can work on. There's a viable path where you focus on the train route, a path where you can focus on having one really long train, and one where you can focus on having two short, but really high quality trains. As you play through the different possible setups there may even be more paths that I haven't even seen yet. The crazy tension of the game comes from the mechanism where when half the cards have been selected from a display row, the remaining cards in the row flush out. Not only that, but there are big endgame scoring cards that give you points for each copy of a single type of card you've collected, which incentivises suboptimal actions in an incredible way.

Light-medium card drafting game that shares similarities with Russian Railroads. It plays around an hour, which is a huge plus, but there is plenty of depth in this game.

Abstract (point) engine builder (train theme really pasted on). The drafting of the actions on the card is very similar to Russian Railroads and I agree with others that there are quite some similarities. The action drafting can even be quite a bit meaner, especially if start player is chosen such that the player can also choose which action to discard (and deny to others).

First Class plays surprisingly quickly so I do not mind its abstract and point saladly like nature as much as  with longer games (for which I tolerate this qualitities less and less).

I enjoyed this game a lot. It starts off pretty slow, but you can really build up a good engine to have a waterfall effect with bonuses. You really can't ignore moving your train along the tracks to get those started, but on the flip side, if that's all you do, the bonuses won't help you as much. The modules are fantastic for replayability. It will be a lot of fun mixing them up to see what each combination brings.

Hard to decide which is better between this or Russian Railroads. They both have a similar feel - a very similar feel. In the end I'll have to give the nod to First Class because the card drafting is essentially a worker placement game where the actions coming up in a round are either unknown or differently distributed between games. The modules obviously help greatly with this. The lack of variability in Russian Railroads meant it felt stale to me after several plays, while First Class is to a large extent unpredictable. Both games like to throw in little bonus actions between your actions, which sparks things up a bit and makes the player feel they have more input into decisions - more so in First Class than Russian Railroads. It's a bit of a puzzle, a chaotic puzzle where you are concentrating on different aspects of your game and trying to stay out of the way of your opponents. As such there's a bunch of indirect player interaction, so barely any real player interaction at all. It matters a great deal what your opponent is taking, but they're doing it because they need whatever first for their own plans. There's not a lot of messing with each others plans on purpose and for me that makes it a little bit dull. A solitaire type game where your opponent could very easily be replaced by a basic AI player in an iPad app. You play the game a lot more than the other players. They're at the table, but they could easily not be. This one is going to go down well with the solo gamers, but for me it's just another light distraction. Final turns can drag a bit as players go through their actions to maximise points.

Damn close to perfect. Damn close! It's not perfect, perhaps nothing is - I'll get into that in a minute - but I am still completely in love with it. I never would have suspected I would like an open-face drafting game - everyone can see the cards you draft - but I love the signaling in this game. You can see what everyone is doing and you are very involved in shaping the course of a game. You are in each other's business in a way that I haven't really felt since Innovation. And there are crazy combos in this game that you are trying to both grab hold of and prevent.

I also really, really love that the tough choices start right off the first pick. In 7 Wonders, you get one wood and then you build a little building and then you get a few coins. The cards do ramp up like that somewhat in this game - but the modules make it feel like 7 Wonders' purple cards have been shuffled into the Age I deck. You can grab contracts right from turn one that seem way down the road, but could also be possible if you can manage to swing it.

The defect in this game is the game end scoring cards, in my opinion. Most games they are worthless - it's only the 3s and 4s that are any good. But, unfortunately, if four worthless game end scoring cards are dealt at the beginning of the game - then it's as if that part of the game has been turned off or removed.

For this reason, I insist on adding the Teatime expansion - it partially solves this problem by giving another outlet for gold in the scoring phase - especially since it's the railroad track game end cards that are the worst - and Teatime helps to increase the value of railroad track cards. (Suddenly upgrading to 2 during the first round is worth it.) The side effect of this, though, is that the value of the best upper track rail card - the one that gives a 0, a 1 and a 2 each round - skyrockets, perhaps making the game a little lop-sided on luck. I can't say for sure, but I feel like there is a little unsolved blemish here.

Also, when it boils down to it, I think that 4 player games aren't quite as fun because it's too crowded and taking the first player token becomes a second-round necessity - but some modules may be better than others. I almost wish three modules could come in for four player.

In all though, what has been accomplished with First Class is extraordinary. It took me a dozen plays before I realized the depth here. Work on getting your score beyond 250 and you'll see. It's just so unassuming - it's not a long game! It's staggering to think that playing eighteen (small, I should add) cards can be so tricky and deep. Selecting a card is just so strategic - in a similar way to Targi - there is both a hate-drafting element and trying to find the best play. But even better - is that playing that card into your tableau can be a peculiar puzzle, trying to know how to play it within the interesting timing windows and with an eye toward your larger strategy - especially with some of the later modules. To make a 30-45 minute game with such an insane spectrum of strategy has just been unthinkable until now. Especially with the simplicity of the rules. I don't know of anything like it. And, what's more - it's fun! It's really really fun!

And, lastly, one amazing innovation to this game is the idea that it is built on top of five expansions that are really the centerpiece of the game - they really dictate the extremes of the power in this game. Being able to combine two modules means that there are all kinds of flavors built into the base game and there's no worry about expansions taking the game in the wrong direction because they are the game. Better - there is a lot of replayability in the base box. More than most people can explore. I've played over a hundred games and still have much to uncover in the base box.

Hats off to Helmut Ohley - truly a masterpiece.

A lighter engine building strategy game with a drafting mechanics. While interesting, I care less about the drafting aspect as it is just a different way to display worker placement with variable actions per round. 
The game appears to offer multiple paths to victory which is a big plus. Unfortunately just with many other engine building game, it is unforgiving to new players and the final scores can have a huge gap between new and experienced players.

Played once with 4P. First Class manages to capture the feel of Russian Railroads within a much shorter playtime. You still have the bottlenecked tracks and VP snowballs, although they are toned down here. Something that I don't enjoy in Russian Railroads – that players are essentially hammered into the same dominant strategies from game to game – is somewhat addressed through the use of modules in First Class.

Speaking of which, the Murder module is fairly luck-based in comparison to the other modules, but would probably appeal to more casual gamers. Personally, I think this "corruption"-based mechanism adds a little playfulness to the conventional proceedings. The other module I played, "Passengers and Baggage", sets up powerful chain reactions for players who focus on them. 

First Class sacrifices the depth of Russian Railroads for a snappier playing time, and I'm perfectly happy with that. It's a real table hog though. The downsides to it is that I find its graphic design rather unclear especially with regards to the endgame multipliers. The endgame multipliers themselves feel a little forced in their inclusion.

First Class has worked its way into my Top Ten Games. The level of strategy involved, when it basically boils down to a fairly straight forward drafting game, is incredible. So many choices, strategic vs tactical decisions, short and long term goals all present. I love having the different modules. They change the feel of the game entirely but there aren't any new rules to learn.

This is a masterclass of game design; magic!

RATING: 7
2 plays, modules A and B

It's a quick-playing, sort of train-themed, an action selection/set-collection game. You get only 18 actions in the game, played as 3 actions over 6 rounds (plus extra mini-actions you can take by spending coins). Each round has 18 cards in display, with players taking turns choosing actions. Not only does the chosen card give you an action, it also goes to your score pile. End game cards (start with one, may get more during the game) serve as multipliers for the different types of cards. The game also has a very cool customization system: it comes with 5 modules (A-E) but you only play with 2 at a time = 10 different combinations. Even with the same combo, cards will come up in random order and configurations so there is a lot of variability -- looking forward to trying the other modules!

---
Modules D, E: 1 play 2er. It's a nice change, cool use of the space between trains. I don't think this is an especially fun combo, though.
---
Module C (&A): 1 play 2er. Wow, C SUCKS!! Especially with two (even with the Dummy Players variant), but it doesn't seem like it'll be much better even with more players. Feels overly random.

The feeling of gameplay is a lot like Russian Railroads. Tracks that players invest in and run for the best VP's offer at the moment. It should be explored more and should be played a lot in order to understand all the nuances on strategies available.

Like Russian Railroads, this is a lot of fun if you like point salad, ramped up scoring nonsense.  I've only tried A+B, but the way different modules interact might add a lot of replayability.

Most certainly derived from something that started as "Russian Railroads - The Card Game", First Class is an interesting challenge in itself. I am not sure whether all the cards to draft are really of comparable strength, but that must not be a bad thing in a drafting game.

I like train games so I sat down for a try.  WE got a couple of rules wrong and two of the players ran away with the game.  The game is a tile laying game disguised as a card game.  It is okay but again I like to plan three turns in advance and this game you cannot do that .  so after turn 2 I was not particular interested in maintaining a competitive focus on the game.  I will play it in the future but only if asked twice

Biggest surprise of 2016.  Soooo much good packed into such a succinct experience.  Hands down the best card game of 2016 and perhaps my favorite ever, although it is too early to make such a strong statement (maybe newness is weighing too heavily to declare it best ever - will need to follow up in several months to a year; haven't even played all of the modules).

RATING: 7.3
tl;dr: solid and refreshing

Three years ago this designer and publisher teamed up (with an other designer) to bring me my favorite game of that year, and one of my favorite train games of all time. It's also one of the most original train games I've ever played. Now they team up again for yet another original train game. You could say the way the wagons are scored is reminiscent of [thing=144733][/thing], but the rest of the game is quite different.
The fact that you can only take 3 actions in a round is very limiting and forces you to make good decisions.
While I did very bad on this first play, I did enjoy the game quite a bit. I don't think it will ever top Russian Railroads, but it's certainly worth playing as it is not just a good game, but also quite different from most train games.

Initial rating: 7.3/10
BGG scale: 7/10

RATING: 5
Game has some cool combos, but I dislike the luck factor, given by the fact, that each time 4 out of 40 cards are out of the game in each deck. This can make or break a solid strategy, in particular with modules A&B, which are the modules, I played by far the most.

Also module C, while being the most hyped by the publisher, is really wonky and stupid.

Mostly played with cards, with oddly shaped (but useful) player boards, you play with the base game and two of five modules. Kind of a point salad game, you have to balance tactical play with your long term goals, which are to complete and upgrade as much of your two trains as you can and choose cards to gain VPs according to your starting goal card. It's more interesting than I'm making it sound.

Second/third play: still good. Better thematically than Russian Railroads: the "track" cards are really passenger cars of increasing opulence, though shown portrait so you just see a slice of each car. The "track", conductor, engine, and other cards are not crisply distinguished, which is annoying. The place-car vs. upgrade-car (= x-"track") symbology could be clearer--or maybe the cards are just too small.

The game handles different numbers of players easily and "naturally" (probably indistinguishable from "in a manner I like").

Quick little card drafting game with a big table footprint. Quite opaque when it comes to optimizing points, but more play will probably help in that department. Not as fun as I'd hoped it would be though.

One could call this Russian Railroads: The Card Game, with card drafting for actions rather than worker placement. Lots of choices, very nice artwork.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First Class is a lot like Russian Railroads. It's also train themed and not particularly "train-y" (although it carries the train theme much better than RR did). It also has the same type of ramping scores where initial turns hardly score at all but later turns score a ton of points. It's not as pronounced as it is in RR though.

    In FC, there's a tableau of cards, and on your turn you take a card and do the thing on the card. Each row of cards has six cards (at least in the 4 player game) and when any four of them are taken the other two are scrapped. After all players have taken two cards, the round ends. The game is played over three rounds.

    There's four main things you are trying to do in FC. First, you're trying to build a route. You take route cards and add them to your existing route. These look a lot like the pirate's "x marks the spot" treasure maps. Second, you're trying to advance your train on that map. There's immediate points on your route as well as bonuses that trigger every scoring phase (if you've advanced that far.

    The third and fourth things are on a completely different side of your board and pretty much have nothing to do with the first two. These are building your train and then moving engineers along your train. Building your train is a process where you get new train cars (which start at a value of 0) and then upgrade them (first to a value 1, then 2, then 4, then 7 and finally 12). You have two trains and you can build them out independently and move engineers along them independently. During the scoring phase if your engineer has reached or passed a train car, you get points equal to it's current value.

    So the various cards you draft from the tableau will be: route cards with various amounts of points and bonuses, route doublers, train movements on your route (these vary 1-3 spaces or so), add train cars and/or upgrade train cards (some upgrades are specifically from one number to another like 0 to 1 whereas others are to upgrade any number one step), train car doublers, and advance engineers on your train (1-3 cars). There's also cards that give you money and cards that let you buy bonus goal cards (that reward you points for every card you have of a particular type, like engineer movements, etc.). Alternatively, you can choose to take the first player marker (which gives you two coins, the next player nothing and subsequent players train cars and/or a 0->1 ugrade).

    Money you get during the game gets stored in a grid. And you can spend money from that grid at any time to do a bonus action depending on where the coin is stored. You must fill the first column first, then the second and then the third. Each column grants a different bonus. So the more money you bank the cooler power you can trigger... but then you have to refill from left to right again.

    When you advance each of your trains five space, you get to place a free train car with a bonus power (you have four to choose from). And when you place your ninth car in each train, you get a free tenth train car that comes with either 2 upgrades (early) or 1 (late). There's a bonus for the first 3 people to finish a train. Those 10th train cars also score points each scoring phase if you get an engineer that far. (Earlier cars score fewer points).

    The game has a fair bit going on, but most of the game is in the drafting. There's a lot of things that can combo off each other with all the train bonus cars and route bonuses. There's also a number of other modules that can be added into the game to change how things play. I didn't feel that this game had as much of set strategies as RR does, which I liked.

First impression with 2p: The game starts out slow and it feels like 6 rounds just isn't sufficient to get the engine rolling or moving. The last 2 rounds really snowballs as the cards become more powerful and the effects are stronger. However, the ending is quite abrupt and the largely feels unsatisfying. Perhaps this is a feature of the game but just when things appear interesting, the game comes to an end prematurely. Otherwise, having never played Russian Railroads, the game is quite unique in several aspects. I enjoy the modular nature of combining base decks with different modules and can see a huge amount of variability in subsequent plays. What is unclear to me if this game will hold up to repeated plays in terms of strategy.
Overall, a worthwhile addition to my collection given the unique card drafting mechanism.

Good game released at Essen 16 highlighting stupid publisher business choices. Everything in it is language neutral, yet they only release it with a copy of the rules in German. It would have been so much easier and business smart to release it with the rules in multiple languages. Pure arrogance and stupidity.  BTW, my rating is for the game, not the company's marketing  stupidity. That would truly rate a "1".

The mechanic allowing for use of two different modules allows for endless variety as well as expansion opportunity. A good design decision.

First impression is that it's a mid-weight card based euro that has the general "feel" of Russian Railroads with less of a time investment.  There is a bit more indirect player conflict (i.e. more blocking) with this game because there are broader actions, and thus the player can choose one of many "good" cards in a way that effectively eliminates a whole row of options for opponents.  Overall, two thumbs up!  Can't wait to play it again and apply more specific tactics.  If there is one complaint it would be that the game moves almost "too" quickly, and one or two more rounds would be great.  Yet, I also appreciate the brevity of the game.

RATING: 6.5
The first time I played this I felt kind of "meh" about it. It's a big point salad, and the strategies felt limited with the starting modules. But the second and third times we used different modules, and I enjoyed it more as more strategies opened up. I'm still not crazy about the way the whole row of cards disappears after two cards are picked up - it makes it hard to plan ahead. But I do kind of like the randomness of the cards. I also enjoy the pleasant theme and design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Recognizable as Russian Railroad the card game though it plays very distinctly.  A very cool action selection tableau drawn sequentially through three era decks.  The action cards are used to do the usual train game stuff; lengthen and upgrade trains, move the conductor to the front, expand a railway, get celebrities to board, fill contracts.  Rows of actions get removed quickly making it a very frustrating challenge.  Five specialty decks add themes, tech upgrades, and twists (even murder) that can be seeded into the era decks is a great idea for fresh replays.

A game very alike Russian Railroads. However, where RR made me enjoy the game, this cardpicking game made it too fiddly with all the bonus cards - especially at the 3rd scoring. The end brought down the rating a lot.

What I really enjoyed about this game was how it starts to snowball after the first round. I started thinking there was no way I was going to grow these trains at the first round pace, but that changed rather quickly.  The combos you create are very satisfying as well. Lots of great decisions to make throughout and definitely gives that "can't do it all vibe" you get in a euro game. I really had a great time. Hats off to Helmut Ohley for a wonderful game. Thank you kind sir.

* [thing=239052][/thing] (Ordered from cundco.de)

I’m very not into trains aesthetically or thematically, but I’m slowly becoming a convert with all these excellent train-themed games. I generally love action selection/drafting games, and this has a really unique spin on it with the 3x6 row of cards and clearing rows on certain triggers. There’s so many things you want to do on your turn, but with only 18 actions in the entire game, you certainly won’t be able to do everything you want. It’s that sweet tension in a game that ensures it never overstays its welcome. While we enjoyed our play of the game that used Module C, I'm not sure how often we'll play with it. I’m glad we tried it out, though.

We played the game a few times over the past year and it rose up the rankings...but upon retrospect I'm dropping it back down.

as time goes by I have less and less interest in playing it.  Maybe I'm getting jaded.

fun quick PRETTY filler.  a bit chaotic, I would recommend taking out some of the action cards, maybe a third of them...but maybe with hardcore players that keep track, the extra chaos is necessary....  Worth the pickup, however, note that I got a deck that was off registration (the pictures were not centered and almost touching the edge of the cards).  I will add to the comment when Looney Lab replies. Update: They mailed out the cards very promptly and I got them a week later!  Thanks guys!
Make sure to play with the multi-connection bonus rule.  I missed the rule in my first few plays that it makes it so much better that I am a couple plays from pushing it up to a 10.  This 2.0 version of the rules is much better than the rules in the javaquarius simulation (though the simulation is worth checking out if you're debating whether to get the game).

I don't really understand the bad rep this gets. It's really fun and light, but also has room for a lot of strategy. Sure, there are ways to twist the game to your level, and ways to have the game swept out from under your feet, but I find it's a good starter or inbetween game that everyone I've tried it with has been please about!

Fun little domino like card game. Good with kids, can be a real good bluffing game with adults. I think this gets bad ratings due to the way it often ends. You build your empire or rainbows, then someone trades goals with you and wins. While I don't enjoy that component, I always have fun with this game.

The cards that allow you to swap goals really suck.  Whenever you get one played on you, you say, "Why exactly have I been playing the game so far?"  They remove all of whatever strategy exists in the game, and I'd recommend getting rid of them.

Dominos with action cards - unfortunately the trade and swap goals cards turn it to chaos, if you like Fluxx give this a try. If you don't then avoid it.

A light, pleasing game for all ages. As is common among Looney Labs card games, you can just deal three cards to a newcomer and bring them on in the middle of the game. I'm quite fond of Andy Looney's hippie art here: I like it better than the Elmore art in the Seven Dragons re-theme.

It's a good diversion, and great to play with the older relatives who have vision problems. But with 5 players, there's slightly too much down time between turns and it's too hard for anyone to get a winning connection. The "rainbow optimized" artwork in the 2009 edition is beautiful!

Cute, simple, and very visual.  The lack of text in this game makes it easy for the very young and the very old to play.  I'd prefer art-deco art to the hippie art that it uses, but I'll take what I can get.  Sleeve the goal cards as soon as you can.

RATING: 7
PLayed this awhile back, then recently rediscovered it through the online version, Javaquarius.  I had forgotten how much fun it was.  People bemoan the random element, which I guess is fair, but I find it a very addictive, quick, lite game; not meant to be a serious brain-drain.  The artwork is kinda neat and the extremely thin "hippie" theme really has no bearing on the abstracts of the game.  There are strategies and definitely technique, it's just not very heavy.  For a slightly better game, the "swap goals" cards should be removed though as they are a bit too powerful (you can easily see a pattern in your opponents cards and when he's about to win, you simply swap goals and you've won).  The shuffle goals card is OK since the effect is balanced by randomness.  I've heard some people compare this to Fluxx, but they're entirely different games.  Well worth a try for a simple, $9 casual game.

Components: Another tile game with cards as the tiles; I would definitely prefer tiles, though perhaps not at the cost it would necessitate. The art is simple and somewhat appealing.

Experience: A bit boring, as I try to link together tiles featuring my secret objective. Either I go straight for the objective and gives myself away, or I 'bluff', as the game suggests, but risk handing the game to my opponent.

Gentle card laying game in which you're aiming to create a contiguous area seven panels wide.  All games tend to go the same way: you block others until the playing area becomes too large to control any more, and then somebody wins.

RATING: 5
A quick and light filler, which is almost pure chaos due to the action cards which cause players to get new (random) objectives or take goals from other players.   But, in essence, it is a tile-laying game with cards, not unlike a dominoes variant.   You are trying to get 7 colors (patterns) together in a group.  Some cards have various patches of color patterns on them, but cards must be matched along the edges.   Simple and harmless and even though it doesn't have much depth, the speed of play could give it some appeal.

Good game of bluffing. The domino-style card laying is fun. The cards, however, do wear out fairly quickly -- especially the Goal cards. It sure would be good if Looney Labs sold replacement packs of just the Goals. Oh, and, just for fun, you should try "Aquari-Chicken" one day -- you play as usual, except that you try not to look at your Goal. It's fun, trust me...

I played this a few times with my girlfriend.  There is a secret element to this game (You get assigned an element and you have to connect 7 cards with that element) At first I was trying to be sneaky and use "strategy" and hide my secret element, but that was a total bust because she would just play to her element and I'd lose.  After about 3 games I started being obvious and started winning.  I didn't like that trying to be clever hurt my chance of winning.

Sometimes I like to take out the action cards and play like dominoes, but having them available makes the game a bit cut-throat.  Part of the reason I like this game is that my son beat the Looneys twice in a row during one of their events. :)

While this is a good game to play with kids, it really shines in a group of good bluffers.  There is some small subtlety to the way one should go about connecting their elements.

A very interesting take on the basic mechanic of dominoes. Unfortunately, the special cards insert too much chaos and may change the game situation in such a degree that it practically becomes a party game. A player's secret objective (victory condition), for example, may change up to 6 times during the game.

RATING: 5
Feels like a not-as-interesting version of 7 Dragons.  If someone was convinced that it had more depth, I could be coaxed into another play, but after a first game I don't think I would seek out another.  Too shallow to keep me engaged, and too slow to keep me interested as a filler.  Even so, it's the kind of game I would play if it meant hanging out with people I enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The prettiest and most elegant of the Looney Labs games. A large degree of chance, but short play time and meaningful choices make you enjoy it. Can be taught quickly to anyone who has ever played dominoes. The action cards are slightly overpowered, but it just makes you save them until you really need them, which is not a problem, per se. If you own one Looney Labs game, this should be it.

A 'groovy' game of dominos played with cards.  The unique feature of this game is the 'goal' card (1 of 5) that acts as your secret objective throughout, so bluffing is a must.  We eliminate the 'trade/shuffle goal cards' action cards from the game when playing with 2.  -Traded

Usually I don't like to say "this game sucks" but... This game sucks. It's like merging Fluxx with dominoes while leaving aside all the fun and only picking the worst of each. The chaos is so high that it's only playable with two: with more players it will only get more and more frustrating.

I must say that the initial idea is good, but its implementation fails completely mainly due to a group of cards: the "change goal" ones. It should be prohibited by law a game in which secret objectives can be interchanged, and this is the proof. Sadly, if you remove the cards that allow you this the game, even if it's more playable, it becomes even more boring.

All in all, a horrible game that should be avoided by everybody unless you absolutely love chaos and the feeling of not being in control of anything. The weird reason is that I like Fluxx precisely for that chaos, but I think that the difference is that Fluxx is only chaos, while this wanted to be something more, so a sensation of futility grows inside you with every card you play.

This is a nice filler game. You position colorful cards to make five connections of your goal "color." Other cards change the position of the cards, swap goals and shift the cards in hand around. The artwork is cartoony and psychelic and fits the theme nicely. It may be too chaotic for some, but it's a nice little pattern-making game.

I don't really like dominoes that much. Gave it to Ava.

...[i]many[/i] years later, played this again, and I think I 'get' it a little better. I still don't like dominoes, but this is undeniably better. The seemingly inelegant whole-sides-don't-match-up thing it actually quite necessary, as it allows for blocking. That in turn provides tough choices between building up your own position, and hurting your opponent. Good games present tough choices. So I think I have to raise my rating.

Good play can usually keep everyone out of it until the end and then with the goal switching its a random ending for who got the most connecting elements.

主題:0.5
主題是星座，完的圖片內容則是風火水土等元素，遊戲規則則是類似相同元素的拼接圖片遊戲，主題不是很明顯，可以套用很多不同的題目，題目改成元素接龍也不為過分。遊戲主題不強烈!

美術:0.7
每個元素的美工很有特色，彩繪十分鮮艷，讓人在接龍過程中也能享受遊戲帶來的視覺享受，就圖片接龍而言，這樣的美術很必要，另外小朋友的接受度也比較高。但只是小品卡片遊戲，美術成就只能到達這種程度。

規則:1
就是先隱藏自己的目標元素，然後透過放置卡牌的過程中，讓相同元素拼接再一起，誰先連到7張相同的元素，誰就獲勝。當然還有額外的特殊牌，可以來改變遊戲過程，當作是玩家的一種策略。遊戲規則簡單好教學，也是推坑入手的好桌遊。

設置:1
就僅僅是發手牌後就可以開始的遊戲，跟撲克牌一樣好開。

路線:0.3
運氣重的遊戲，外加很針對他人的遊戲，牌運佔了遊戲過程中很大，另外常常莫名其妙的就有人獲勝，是個讓人完成看不出這遊戲由什麼決策可言。

互動:0.8
互動算是強烈的入門遊戲，每一片卡片的擺放，都會影響下一位玩家出牌的擺放方式，尤其是藉由換身分牌或者元素牌，更是大幅度影響每個人的命運，就剛接觸桌遊的人來說，這是一種有趣的體驗。

個人:0.6
簡單小心機的入門遊戲，會喜歡跟新手玩，，因為會有輸的壓力，但可以透過嘴砲過程來影響決策者擺放圖片的位置，也是很有趣。

朋友:0.7
小朋友很喜歡，大人反應普普。

想玩:0.4
過了桌遊的新鮮感時期，現在都在玩口味比較重的遊戲。

收藏:0.5
遊戲卡片很適合全家大小，也有看過不同版本的遊戲，例如奇幻類型。遊戲機制不難，偶爾玩還是需要一點小心機，算是可以收的一款小品遊戲。

總分:6.5
講評:就是一款圖片接龍的跑跑龜，隱藏目標，放置圖片耍耍心機，讓自己的目標元素連成7片，推薦給大家。

A card game where you have to create a chain of seven elements that are determined by your secret goal card.

Fantastic artwork.

Aquarius is like four sided, secret goals dominions.  It reminds me a lot of Twin Win, my favorite Icehouse game except I like Twin Win better because the game state changes more easily.  There is much more opportunity for chaos.  Normally, I prefer card games to non-card games, but with Aquarius this isn't the case.  Perhaps Aquarius is better suited for three players than Twin Win though.

That being said, there is still strategy and player based chaos.  The cards are well constructed, beautifully designed and well proportioned.

RATING: 10
This game was re-made (re-imagined?) by Looney Labs into Seven Dragons recently, but we prefer the old version!

There are 2 major version of Aquarius, the newer one with the diagonal panels and extended rules (with multi-connection bonuses etc), and the older version with side-split horizontal and vertical panels, but with no diagonals. 

Both versions are worth playing. Mindy keeps this in her purse most of the time. It has become a staple of our collection.

Why I love Aquarius:

1) can teach a new player to play in under 1 minute.

2) all ages

3) great artwork. a cultural time-warp.

4) fun, funny, simple and fast

5) 2 player is great, 5 players is wild.

6) lots of strategy and luck involved.

What else do you need?! Go get this card game, duh!

A fine light hidden goal game of tile placement with colorful cards. I'm not a fan of the several Looney-style "big unexpected change of game state" special action cards, but the game is short enough that I enjoy it for what it is: something fun and casual (which so far I've played only at Esperanto meetings for some reason!)

RATING: 6
A fine filler that works well with non-gamers. There's a little too much chaos for my tastes though, as you can work the whole game to get 6 in a color, and have your goal switched at the last second. Still, games are short enough that this isn't a huge deal.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating for two-player variant (otherwise the rating is a 5 or 4.5 rating).  Portable and quick filler.  My daughter really likes it.  

Two Player Variant: Each player takes two goal cards (instead of one) and must complete both goals as usual.  When a player plays the "Trade Goals" action card, players can select which of their two Goal cards they want to trade away.  When a player completes on of the two goals, they turn the Goal card face up.  If an action-card changes the board so that there are no longer seven element-cards completing a goal, then the Goal card must be turned face down.  The first player to have both Goal cards turned face up wins.  Also, the "Rotate Goals" card  allows a player to switch one of their Goal cards for the fifth unused Goal card. The rest of the game plays as it would normally.

Aquarius (and Seven Dragons, which is the same game with a draconic theme attached) has a lot to recommend it as a filler game.  It's also a game that a player can be added midway through without any balance problems or hiccups.  Sometimes we play with 5 connecting cards as the victory condition instead of 7, to raise the stakes and make the game even quicker.  It's not the dawning of a new gaming age or anything, but its easy to teach and the tables can turn on a single turn.

RATING: 8
I should hate this game.  It's chaotic, there's no ability to plan or control, and it's incredibly light.  Strangely enough, I liked it quite a bit.  I found the game to be a lot of fun and while I never felt like I had control, it never really bothered me.

The artwork on this game is great.  It's simple, but the colors just pop out at you.  It makes the game really nice on the table.

**********EDIT************

I've upped my rating to an 8.  Why?  This game is great!  It's what Fluxx should have been: short, easy to teach and play, and visually attractive.  It's a perfect quick game that you can teach to anyone.

Purchased at DexCon 7/8/11.

This is an exceptionally simple card game. So simple that my mother was willing to play with my daughter. It's accessible to children as young as 3 while still having appeal to pre-teens. For the adults it's not likely to be very interesting but it is a way of engaging your child in something slighly more challenging than a jigsaw puzzle.

Like most card games there's a lot of luck of the draw involved, and there's potential for all of your hard work to be undone when another player switches goals on you, but it plays quickly and looks great on the table, so that's not a big issue.

I'm still amazed at just how much the different number of players effects game play and strategy.  My wife and I must have played two player about twenty times through the first day we got this game an thought we knew what we were doing when we bumped it up to three players and had to learn all over again.  Not a majorly competitive game but in our circle of friends that is just right.

I do particularly like the changes that have been made to the new edition.  My favorite is that with no shuffling of the goals, keeping track of where each goal is has become a very viable winning strategy.

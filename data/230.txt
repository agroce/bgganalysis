Have played twice so far and absolutely love it!  Both games were not played to completion due to time constraints, so I wasn't able to see how the mid-to-end game develops.  It is very, very promising, though, and when I get a full game in I'll update my rating and comment.

Seemed pretty old school to me (AH version). Not a lot to really get my juices flowing as the graphics themselves were so bland. Needs an updating. I like the idea of a space-themed game using a railroad pick up and deliver engine. Sold it (AH edition).

Very good game, but beginning to show it's age. 
Theme is central, not a simple tack-on. 
Can be a little isolationist, so better with 4 - 6 players.
Easy pick-up.

Rating reduced in 2014 after further playings made the game seem rather more boring.

RATING: 8
Usually fun, we play with all the rules, including combat. Invokes a bit of Piracy and manipulation. Downside is rolling lousy and finding no spiffy relics. We refer to game as "Spuds"; short for Space Spuds, in that the variable rock tokens that placed around the board hiding relics and penalties resemble Potatoes. 
Variable set ups give the game charm and mental exercise to figure the best path to Victory.

Not a bad game, even though my one playing was inhibited with some of the worst luck I've known.  I might score this higher if not for the game length - we went close to 3 hours in a 4 player game and did not finish.  I'd play again - I think it's one of those games that is very helpful once you have played once.

RATING: 7
Merchant of Venus is a game for 2 to 6 players.  Each player assumes the role of a merchant from a different species. Though set in a science fiction universe, the game illustrates the time-less realities of commerce. Once the players have located the goods and customers, the game spotlights how seed money, profits margins, carrying capacity, turnaround time and expenses interact to define the profits that a trader makes. All of the cultures are descended from colonists of the main Galaxy. When the Empire fell, each culture kept only the science that it had develped. Each culture's science defines how it tries to control nature. Primitive cultures personalize natural forces. Bioengineering cultures direct life process. Industrial cultures employ physics and chemistry. Technological cultures control electricity and atomic energy.  Metaphysics cultures manipulate the fundamental principles of reality.

Expected playing time is about 2.5 - 3 hours.

If I didn't get as much enjoyment as I should have from this, then it was probably because it had been a long convention, I needed sleep, and I was plastered. Apologies to anyone I kept waiting.

I like the strategic and random setup elements equally here.  With the re-designed pieces it's quite a looker now as well.  The train game aspect reminds me of AoS, RRT and the like where you look for patterns to generate income over multiple turns.  There is alot more to juggle here tho and can be a little fiddly when compared to modern euros.

I really like this sort of pick up and deliver game. Still, it took a while to get the hang of it and by the time I realized what I needed to be doing there was no hope of winning. Enjoyed it nonetheless and thought perhaps it was the inspiration for a PC game I used to play called Gazillionaire and another for the Palm OS called Space Trader.

10/20/2011 Remake announced by Stronghold games.

Tentative rating after one play.  I don't feel that the game is as dated as many posts have indicated.  Nice pick up and delivery mechanism, with a good replenishment mechanism.  However there is a lot of writing on the chits which is hard on aging eyes.  Fun, but randomness and luck play a big part in this game.  Looking forward to a replay.  Rating will probably go up.

Clippers seem to be a favorite around here, and you need to start making runs/earning money quickly, because once you're behind...

For the first half, this is a fun game of speculative trading and exploration featuring funny alien races and a bit more strategy than you might expect in a roll and move game.  For the second half, it is an exercise in drudgery as the roll and move mechanic dominates the eventual outcome of the game.

In our test game, money came in very slowly even after all cultures had been discovered. It took 4 of us 3 hours to get one player over the 1k mark, which is way too long for a game with that little interaction.

One of the most fun trading games there is.  My gaming group likes this game.  Play to higher winning amounts and you'll notice differnt end games.  Leave out the nasty alien race though, they ruin the multiplayer game.  Highly recommended but getting more difficult to find.  Set up time is a bit long, and there is a bit of downtime between turns, but it doesnt hurt the game.  Replay value is huge since the starting planets are different each time.

One play and I really like the game.  It seems there are a good number of ways to mitigate bad rolls of the dice.  For some reason, our game went a bit long but I felt like I (and the others) were moving at a reasonable pace with our turns.  There was a part of the mid-game where I traveled halfway around the galaxy doing practically nothing and I think that was my demise... otherwise, I'd felt like I was off to a good start.

The overall economy is pretty interesting with the different products and demand and space stations and factories that generate unique products.  There is a lot going on and the "jump start" relic I picked up really help me shoot around through the jump gates in the top-right portion of the board.  I hope I get the chance to try this again.

Two plays now and this game is good.  Both times I felt like I hit a lull in the mid-game that cost me.  Still, there are a lot of clever elements in this game and the randomness of the dice and discovered asteroids seems very well managed by the overall design and mechanics of the game.  Too bad it takes 3 hours to play because I'd like to play it more.  Hopefully, I will get some chances.

2 plays.  I'm a sucker for pick-up-and-deliver games, but this one takes too long for the amount of fun & strategy in the box.  Both games had runaway leaders based on the luck of the face-down tokens.  Takes a long time to figure out the rules & sort all of the chits.  The "cloud" portion of the board can be very annoying.

RATING: 7
Wow! What a design for 1988! It has qualities that I love in Euros (upgrading your ship, finding efficient trading routes, very unique movement options with yellow and red drives and navigation circles, etc.)  But it also has qualities that I dislike in Ameritrash (big swings for dice rolls, TOO MANY rules / options, too much detail detracting from the game.)  I would play it again, but would push for the lowest game end condition possible and to play with no more than 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Used to play this a lot in the 80's - playtime too long for current group's tastes. Fixed map doesn't help replay either. You can drop end $ condition but that then cuts out the freighter strategy.

Nice old school Logistic game with a Sci-Fi setting. 
It`s sometimes difficult to keep track of the 14 Cultures-sites. Also the handling of the hundreds small counter can be fiddly sometimes. The endless cash-counting tend to annoy at the long run. The game-length of 3 to 4 hours isn`t the kind for anybody.
But these are all minor complaints and at all it`s a classic entertainig space trading game.

A fun pick up and deliver game.  The best description I've heard for MoV is that it can be considered an adventure game, where your ship is the character.  Luck is involved but wise investments in equipment help tame the randomness.

Don't use the optional combat rules (they just slow the game down w/o adding to the quality of the gameplay)

RATING: 8
This game was surprisingly good!  Really good!  You play as a merchant of an alien race, moving around the board, discovering other races and opening trade with them.  As the game gets going, you can buy better ships and equipment, better good, and even trading posts, making trade easier for everyone while getting you a cut of the profits.  Remember, you have to spend money to make money!
  This game takes a time commitment, but I thought it was really fun.  It is essentially a "go here, get that, go there" game, but since the races are mixed up every game, it's different every time!


And now it's destroyed.

(> 20 plays) This game is a lot of fun! I love the exploration part of it, the dynamics of the game, the different ways to win the game. I've tried the original setup and the quick setup rules published in the now defunct "General" magazine. Both work for me.The best number of players is 3, followed by 4, followed by 2, but all these numbers of players work pretty well.

It's fine with 2 players because the game doesn't have much player interaction, but it takes longer to discover the different, mostly non-human, races in a 2 players game.I don't like it with 5 or 6 players, because it has a lot of downtime due to its lack of payer interaction. You can spend this downtime by considering your next moves; nevertheless you have to wait too long for your next move with 5 or 6 players.

Despite being an old school game, MoV has aged pretty well. I just love the market mechanism and the two distinct phases: the exploration and the race for the most profitable routes. Being able to determine the game length is also a plus. On the minus side, downtime can be significant (3-4 player counts being the sweet spot) and setup takes at least 10 minutes.

Just a routine comment update, given all the activity around this title recently ...

Although I rate the game decently, I haven't played it much in modern times, post-Settlers. The problem, I think, is just one of balance as mentioned below. There is only one path to victory in Merchant of Venus, and it involves high-value goods and a Clipper. If you try anything else, you will lose to someone who goes that route, it's just a question of how badly (if you try a Transport strategy, the answer is very badly). There just is no room in the game for playing high-margin, low-value goods, or chasing demand markers. This is especially surprising in light of the fact that there is a lot of luck - the imbalance is pretty extreme.

And for heaven's sake don't play with more than 4.

Now, that doesn't mean that the systems inn MoV aren't terrific, or that it's not a ton of fun to play until You figure this out, or that the quirky theme isn't great.

Stronghold has a bunch of stuff slated for straight reprints that, honestly, are not going to hold up to modern gaming standards: Outpost was OK in 1992 but would be terrible today, Crude is a classic but is too long with only one path to victory and an endgame that is problematic, and now Merchant of Venus, a classic for its day but not quite right. All of these games need rework (to varying degrees) to really succeed in today's environment. That's why, despite all the history, I'm actually rooting for FFG's version. Yes, the odds are they'll screw it up. But we know a straight reprint will have significant issues, despite the many fans the game has (myself included). Given the issues are known, I'd rather have a company commit to at least trying to improve the game.
---
UPDATE: I saw I had this rated as an 8, and while I think it's a lot of fun, I realized I just couldn't justify it due to the balance issues. The Clipper is just too strong, and using any other ship is, alas, an almost guaranteed loss even at higher money targets ($3000). The game is still fun, but you have to have this piece of information to play well, which is unfortunate.

I played the Tom Lehmann variant recently, and I think it's a good idea but I think it extends the game by too much to be practical. MoV is great in large part because even if you play to $3000, it's just not that long (90-120min with 4 players, which due to downtime issues is about as many players as is reasonable). Playing with Deeds counting half extended the game to about 4 hours, which is just too long for this game. Oddly enough, it still didn't even change the outcome - the Clipper strategy still won, as it virtually always does, even with all 6 tele-gates in play (although the Transport/Shield/Combo Drive player was quite close). Also, several artifacts are badly undercosted, so starting with them in the Base isn't great.

I do really like the "quick set up" variant, and plan to play with that, the map adjustment (near Cobbleport and Comfort Station), and the "no free shield" in future.  I think I'll try to bring the Clipper/Transport/Freighter into better balance either by adjusting their price or speed dice somewhat. Perhaps giving everyone an extra die, and then giving the Transport and Freighter a price cut while maybe doubling the cost of the clipper might work. I dunno. The Clipper is clearly much too powerful, while the Transport and Freighter are too weak, so almost any adjustment in the right general direction should help.

Fantastic game.  The original science fiction trading game: racing around the galaxy, discovering races, up-grading your ship, delivering the goods where the demand is high - great stuff.  Don't be fooled that it says I've only played this game once - that was only since joining BGG - I owned this when it first came out and have played over 100 times.  Doesn't get old.  I've even tried the solo game against the Rasteur several times, but it's clunky and ultimately rediculously difficult.  Play with your friends - have  a blast.

I have an inexpicable, possibly unnatural, love for this game.  Some people have called it a train game, but it's more of an interstellar trucking game.  You explore the galaxy, discover weird alien races, sell them trinkets, and buy their quaint trade goods and try to unload them at an 80% markup. The board layout is different every time you play.  The descriptions of the alien races and trade goods are hilarious, as well.  An all-time favorite.

Had fun playing this for the first time, but can't help think there is little other players can do to impede or catch up to the leader.  We only played with the basic rules, though, and there's apparently some facilitation for conflict in the advanced/optional rules, but I've heard it doesn't help much.  Maybe a "rover" play like Rail Baron has would help a bit ...

RATING: 5
A long pick up and deliver roll and move game. Yes it's a classic and the variability this game provides is amazing given when it was made. I can see how so many games that have come since then have built off of the ideas of this. However, the length is just too much especially with 6. Other than the demand tiles, this badly needs more ways to combo or engine build as otherwise you do the same thing 2 hours in as you do on your first turn. I'd always rather play something like Istanbul which has the same race approach to pick up and deliver, but is much more streamlined.

I would buy a re-release.  A good Euro style trading game, hobbled by wargame style components, and an 80's game length.  A remake in line with modern production standards and with shorter scenarios for realistic session lengths would be great.

This is a terrific game.  In grand AH tradition, it seems much more complicated than it really is but it's a fairly simple transportation game with some neat economics and a great theme that is imaginative and integrated well into the mechanics.  I also like the exploration element and the randomness present makes for good replay value.  It isn't tremendously taxing intellectually, but it is pleasant and engaging- a treat to play.  A component upgrade and cleaner rules and this could be a modern game but I think it's quite charming as it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Still a classic after all these years. This is my favorite role and move type game. This is basically a train game in space. The early game is one of exploration as you move out among the various worlds to find artifacts and search out civilizations. The game then becomes a race game to see who can lay down the most efficient trading network inorder to reach the cash goal.This game is lots and lots of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
I'm not sold yet, at least not for the cost/hype attributed to the game.  I thought it had some interesting mechanics (the way the roll and move system worked, the IOUs for discovering new races, the bonus for trading with your race, and the randomization of the above...)  I'm not sure if I could get into it to play the "full" game at 4 or 5 hours, where you can combat other players, build lots of factories, etc.  That's a long haul for a "pick up and move" game.  Would definitely like to try again, maybe with a more enthusiastic group.

Played once. No combat mode. Too old school for me. Too much arithmetic. Roll & move. But worse in that it's usually binary whether you rolled enough to get to single place you're trying to go to. The space movement rules are interesting in the theory, but annoying in practice. I found myself simply rolling and asking someone at the table, "can I get there?" and they do all the work and tell me yes or no. I've come to realize I like games where seeing what you [i]can[/i] do is obvious, but choosing which of them is [i]best[/i] is not. Many turns in MoV feel like work just to figure out what you [i]can[/i] do. Both in moving and in buying/selling.

One of the few old Avalon Hill games I still play (though with the FFG version since the counters in this one are too small and fiddly for my old eyes and fingers. A pick up and deliver game that starts with exploration to uncover the map and discover the best trade routes, and a push your luck roll and move movement system that works. Once the routes are uncovered there's the decision of what kind of ship will make best use of them, and the latter part of the game turns into a race to see who can turn a big profit the fastest. I love the frequent decisions of how to invest your money to tempt others into using your ports (and giving you a commission!). Supposedly this was originally a historical game based on shipping trade around the world--I would love to see an updated & revised version that used that theme! The FFG version looks nicer and includes a revised version, but I've only played it using the original rules included in the box (thanks Stronghold!).

I've had to downgrade this one 2 notches from a 9 to a 7.  I played an agonizingly slow game of this a couple of years ago.  And I realized...there's not all that much to this game.  It's fun, but it is basic pick up and delivery strategy of hoping to make the most efficient routes.  The dice being the foil to making it a puzzle game.  Also, I realized I like Firefly better and I'm only rating that a 7.  :)

The best pick-up and delivery game I've played!  Better than the crayon rail games, and I like those games quite a bit.

Merchant of Venus has a fun space exploration aspect.  The alien cultures are interesting to discover.  The dice mechanism (even when it is unkind), gives a lot of suspense and presents interesting choices to make.  I like the economic aspect of buying spaceports/factories.

Opinion based on 1 5er game.

Update (2nd play):  Probably my favorite pick-up and delivery game.  However, I'm worried that the center of the board is the focus of the players.  Ie, some of the board (the corners) don't get used much unless there is a rare optimal route path for delivery which includes the corner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What stands out for me most about Merchants of Venus is how it essentially combines the deep game play and decision styles of the heavier economic with some of the variability and exploration that can be found in some of the better experiential games. The location of particular alien races (customers) and reward/hazard tiles varies each time you play, resulting in the game being divided into distinct phases. In the first one you attempt to locate cultures and useful artifacts while avoiding particularly dangerous hazards, trying to gain an advantage over your opponents in the second phase of the game. In the second phase the players are trying to take advantage of the knowledge revealed to set up trade routes, building space stations and factories to gain enough money to reach the dollar amount required to win. One particularly interesting thing is that these phases are not necessarily sequential. It is very easy to shift between one and another throughout the game, moving off into a previously unexplored system in order to shake up the current situation and potentially win the game. 

All this said, Merchants of Venus is probably my second favorite pick up and deliver game right now (behind Age of Steam) and is something I greatly enjoy playing.

This comment is about the Dathkaden redesign and played with no variants/rule changes other than the extra navigation circle included on the Dathkaden version of the board.

At it's heart MoV is a pick up & deliver game set in space with a roll and move mechanism.  Unlike other games of this genre you'll need to make discoveries of various races and before you can pick things up and deliver them because only certain races want certain products.  Roll and move is generally dislike but it can be mitigated in this game by getting a faster/better ship, relics, and various drives.  I can't really comment on everything or explain everything, so I'll just get into the crux of what I thought about the game: For a game of it's age, it's one that I really respect due to the innovations involved but it's not a game I enjoy playing.  In the 3 - 4 games I've played of this the randomness and luck involved with exploration of the first part of the game, seem to give sometimes give too great of an advantage to one player or really hinder one.  I wouldn't mind this if it were a shorter game but for a game of this length it really sucks the fun out of the game.

[2 plays] Pickup and delivery--in space!  Lots of fun so far.  Reminds me in some ways of the crayon rail games, which I love.  Upgrading your spaceship is similar, though the options are different.  There are also more different options here for equipping your ship.  The relic items are very powerful, and there‚Äôs usually a rush for them at the start.  Switch switch (which I think is probably the best option) and mulligan gear can be very helpful for navigating the dice gates. 

The difference in the random distribution of the races, the relics, and the pace of discovery will make every game different.  This seems like a game that will have tons of replayability; even after experience has made you familiar with the basic layout of the universe and some good strategies, success will depend on your ability to adapt and respond to the unique blend of circumstances in each game.  

After the last game, we did a distribution chart of the demands, which I think is definitely interesting and useful to know.  We‚Äôve only played to $2000 so far, and I am looking forward to trying a longer game, as I think that will really give the game a different shape.  The $2000 game with teaching rules for new players has tended to take about 5h, but that will likely come down as we get an experienced group.  In any case, the game is not tedious; it‚Äôs hours of awesome interstellar fun.

RATING: 5
 I don't get what people see in this one to give it the reputation that it has, and I'm probably hoping against hope here but I'm looking forward to what FFG does with their new version inspired by the original. I've now played Rail Baron, Air Baron, and this one and can't help but see the shadow of Monopoly over all three (to a lessening degree in that order). It makes me realize how constrained game design was back then and appreciate what Klaus did for the hobby. 25 years ago this was worlds away from Monopoly but now seems just like an orbiting moon [/endlamespaceanalogy]. 

I guess it's the sense of exploration that carries this one and the experience of being the leader in establishing an efficient route. Throw in a dose of good fortune as far as relics and fares and you will be in first place in the economic war of attrition and feeling on top of the world. [i]I'm so happy for you.[/i]

The problem for me is that while smart play is definitely required, the game relies too much on randomness and lack of player interaction. On top of that is a sense of hopelessness that once one player jumps out to a lead, well you may as well call the game. Now, I realize I haven't played much so maybe exciting comebacks are possible and that might be wrong. I suspect playing to higher goals gives others the chance to catch up, but then your adding more time.

This is an innovative pick-up-and-deliver game in which the places items can be picked up and the places to which they can be delivered are found in different places each game, and are revealed as the game progresses.

It appears that there is a lot of luck in the game, but it doesn't affect the outcome as much as one might think.   Skill makes a big difference.

I raised my rating to '9' after I started playing to higher winning amounts ($3000 or more.)  It makes a wider range of strategies viable.

One of my grail games, although I don't believe in such things. Played years ago when it was a new release, and loved it with a burning passion when I found it again. Has so much going for it - and yet some fairly obvious flaws. The greatest strengths of the game are 1. The feeling of accomplishment when you actually upgrade to a better ship. 2. The exploration. 

Faults include the tedious set-up and tear-down, and that the board should be "patched" in order to provide what should have been a logical connection between two different parts of the galaxy. A wonderful and enjoyable game, when played by the core rules alone.

DIY version. I used most of RangerRob's files and applied them to Scrabble tiles. I made my own "bonus tiles" to look like the old ones (half and half, no gradiant). My only regret was getting the map printed 22x22 full sheet instead of 20x20 and in sections, so I could easily apply it to a different board and it would be cheaper.

I can understand where this may have been an amazing experience back in the good old days, but having played more recent pick-up and deliver games I found this one to be rather fiddly.  The theme is fun, as are some of the civilizations.  I probably would give this another spin except for as aforementioned I would prefer other like titles.  The game length is a tad long and feels like it drags.  I enjoy the possibilities in this as far as improving ones ship, and the light exploration but everything felt like it just moved at snails pace.  The combat is awful and feels like it was pasted on.

One of the more enjoyable of the old AH games, tells a great story.  We didn't seem to notice the game length back then, but it is a bit long now (2007) compared to most Euros.  Yet I still have a soft spot for it - it plays well, has a sweet economic engine, and if you drop the combat sub-system (which face it wasn't a viable winning strategy anyway) you can still plan it for an evening. Love the back 'history' on the different alien races and why the make what they make and demand what they demand.  Impossible furniture anyone?

Remake, courtesy of Andrew Tullsen.  Fantastic game.

It makes my previous favorite pick up and deliver game (well, more just routes and deliver), Railroad Tycoon, look kind of tame and static in comparison. What a great game---and the little touches are deft and show what an absolute genius Hamblen is. This game has so much more subtlety than RRT and many other pick up games with some very simple rules. Take, for example, the low value goods. You might think that as the game goes on you'd want to only trade in the high value goods and the low value stuff like the mulch wine or spice fall by the wayside. Not so---Hamblen made sure that the "demand" bonuses are pretty much all on low value goods, meaning that some places around the galaxy will want mulch wine so bad, even in late game, that it will induce you to make a low value haul for the bonuses. On top of that, the simple grab bag supply/demand system in the game is brilliant as well. We played a long game and I kept flogging a 5 system loop... by late midgame I had to leave that loop because I had exhausted most of the goods on that route. IOUs and relics are also an amazing, simple additions to encourage exploration and not fixate on finding a single trade route and only using it.

Update---up to 9.5.  This game and Magic Realm swapped places.  If I had a hardcore group maybe Magic Realm would be tops still, but Merchant of Venus hits a sweet spot in terms of a simplicity and depth.  It's very easy to get into but pretty deep once you're in.

Three plays, one with three, one with four and one with five. I find this one to be sort of like playing a solitaire game with other people at the table. Yes, you can try to outrace your opponents to one thing or another, but most often you're just heading for whatever is convenient and profitable. Also, a player who is able to trick out his ship with shields and drives early is going to have an advantage on the table.

"5" is my rating for the three player game, because with three the down time is at least tolerable. With four I would probably drop the rating to a "3" and with five it would hit "2" or a "1." To be honest I feel like this one would work best as a solitaire computer game.

The original game seems to be missing something that would hook you to it. You don't feel like playing another game after your first. And Fantasy Flight's rules are totally crappy, they add useless things to the game that ruins the fluidity of it, making it tedious and boring. Maybe someone can come up with that little something that the game is missing to make it addictive or at the very least, more interesting to play again.

wow, this is one vastly overrated game

dice and chit randomness easily provides more game-winning inputs than player decisions.

if it was fast, I could see the draw.  at over 4 hours, dozens of games come to mind that are far more involving.

MoV Strategy:

#1  move first (random)
#2  move faster (random)
#3  pick-up the IOUs and relics ahead of everyone else (see #1 and #2).  Ideally, find the IOU for your race (random).
#4  when you arrive at a location that sells shields or clippers (random), buy them.
#5  when you are at a location, buy a single good.  sell it at a location that is revealed by your (random) travels.  buying (and selling) two similar goods just slows you down.
#6  when you sell goods, make sure there are (random) demand chits there.
#7  while travelling, pick up the (random) fares that appear.
#8  don't buy anything other than a clipper (transport, freighter).  see #2 if you are confused.
#9  don't buy a factory or factory goods.
#10  don't worry about relative profits on goods or efficiency of certain paths over others (see #1, #2, #5, #6, #7 for why this is true).
#11  follow #1-#10, wait for 4-6 hours.  Victory!

...and a final point - a 5 player game of MoV with 2 or more people having AP; just insert the sharp stick right now.  Since we are talking MoV, pick one of several chits representing how sharp the stick might be, then roll a die to determine which eye it goes in.

I had high hopes given the designer's pedigree (Gunslinger, specifically) and I was not disappointed. The complexity is really quite manageable, especially for an 80's Avalon Hill game. I hate pick up and deliver games generally, but this one is so charming and fun.
That said, the luck is non-trivial, and the game can drag if you play with too many (4 seems to be the upper limit) and/or if you can't get some early good routes. The quick start-up variant is most highly recommended.
And solitaire works very well.

Yeah, this game lives up to all the hype.  A truly awesome pick up and deliver game with a cool slightly goofy scifi theme.  Its like a train game, set in the spaceballs universe, with a lot of thematic ship upgrades, lasers, and space travel chrome.  Roll and move is used so well in this game that you have to see it to believe it.  A great classic that is begging for a reprint.

I played this twice, and found it fun -- because there's a fixed buy-low, sell-high payout schedule, you're always making money, and rarely losing it.  It seemed to be a reasonable length, too -- about 2-3 hours?

Remember to stay focused, and set up a ring of 4 systems that you visit in a cycle, over and over, shuffling goods.  Don't get distracted by tasty demands and fares to exotic locations.  Just set up your loop (including buying a port for sure, and buying a factory if you can), and stick with it.  (Of course, you want to get shields ASAP, and probably a freighter with a red drive and a yellow drive when you can afford it, which may be a while).  We didn't play with weapons, which apparently just makes the game longer, and not better.  It's a fun little capitalist game -- why ruin it with violence? :)

An excellent pick-up-and-deliver type game.  Sure there is some randomness to your movement, but this beats drawing event cards.  The resupplying mechanic works really well, as a route you've established may run dry (again random, but recreating uncertainty).

Although the game appears to start slowly, it does pick up speed as you generate more income.  I am looking forward to playing again, perhaps with some of the advanced rules (like combat).

Merchant of Venus owes a lot to Rail Baron/Boxcars, but added a few nice twists, making it one of the earliest pickup and deliver games, and adding a nice space theme to it.

Players looking for the complications of Age of Steam won't find all of them here, but may find a lot more dice rolling and luck involved than they are accustomed to.

The game has a simple wealth accumulation goal, but players will need to consider what improvements/upgrades will; best help them in that goal and what are extraneous expenses. In the end, cash & property (not your shiny new ship) are what count for winning.

A simple but interesting device featured prominently is the Bonus Cup. This cup holds various demand bonuses and passenger fares, which are placed on the board at specific cultures when drawn. As Goods are Sold, they are put into the Cup, mixed, and an equal number of Bonus Chits drawn out. When Goods are drawn out they are replaced with their culture; so a popular good may be out of stock for some time, and players forced to find different cost/time effective ways to run a profit. The Bonus Chits help in that greatly.

I found this to be a good game once it got rolling, but it takes players a little while to accumulate enough money to fly and then buy, to explore the cultures of the board, and to get effective routes going.

I'm starting it at a 7. I can see why this fairly old-fashioned board game is still a good and relatively popular game, despite its years.

This is a classic "pick up and deliver", set in a sci-fi/space theme. Although the board is fixed, the placement of the various alien races is random and hidden. There is an initial exploration period where players discover new "cultures" (i.e. civilizations) and pick up goods produced by those cultures, and deliver them to other cultures with their ship. There is more exploration to discover cultures that will buy those specific goods. It then becomes a race on who can best optimize and exploit the supply-demand culture relationships, as there are numerous relationships scattered throughout the board. Actually three to five cultures will want this good, so the key is finding the closest one for a quick profit, or one that produces a good that downstream cultures in your "silk road" or "shipping line" network demand. The winning player is usually the one who "discovers" an optimum path/loop that cascades the supply and demand relationships.

MoV is different from the Empire Builder crayon-rail series in several significant aspects:
1) It is a traditional roll-and-move. Speed is not fixed, thus a series of really bad rolls can be devastating.
2) Although the board is fixed, the placement of cultures is hidden, so there is an exploration phase that is missing in EB.
3) The supply and demand relationships are totally random, making each game unique. Anybody can fulfill the contract, as long as there are goods available, and the contract payoff for the good is fixed. In EB, the relationships are fixed--a good may be produced in one or more cities, but must be delivered to the city specified on the contract, which is usually some geographic distance away. There are a number of contracts of varying payoffs scattered within a contracts deck, so what contracts you get are random. In MoV, each culture will produce a specific good, which is only deliverable to three, four, or five other "downstream" cultures. I say downstream because the cultures are numbered from 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9a, 9b, and 10; cultures can only deliver up to +3 their culture number. Culture 4a can only deliver to 5, 6, or 7, but cannot deliver to 4b, or any other number. Since the placement is random, the demand culture may be across the board from the supply culture, or it may be right next door. This makes the game different every time.
4) There are no random punitive events like in EB. However, there are random "demand" incentives that could temporarily alter existing supply-demand relationships/routes by incentivizing other less traveled routes. 
5) No one "owns" track like in EB. Players can improve their ability to move/navigate more quickly and efficiently through technology and artifacts.
6) Although it is a race to collect $X net worth, because no one "owns" links, there is no requirement to link up "Y" number of cities like in EB. However, players can "lock up" systems by buying spaceport deeds and factories, which then count towards the player's net worth.

This is a great game that is fun to play, although some players may be put off by the randomness of the roll-and-move mechanic. Unfortunately, the game starts to drag with more than 4 players, and there is very little player interaction. The AH version is a bit fiddly with lots and lots of cardboard chits and is OOP. It is bland when compared to BGG User Dathkadan's absolutely gorgeous PnP re-imaging. If you don't have the time or patience (like me) to DIY, you can always enlist the help of BGG User Howitzer_120mm, who runs Print & Play Productions. Initial rating is an "8".

Update (11/12/11): Finally got my Dathkadan remake from Print & Play Productions, and I've got to say the artwork is gorgeous. The P&P components are very good and the wooden discs are relatively large and easy to handle compared to other PnP versions I've played with.

MoV absolutely rocks as a 2-player game, as a $3000 game can be cranked out in 2 hours. However, set up and take down do take about 15-20 minutes each (even after the 300+ tokens are sorted out), so that is a liability.

In a 3-player game, I experienced that a poor roll during the first turn can be devastating, as well as going later in the turn order. The first player has a significant advantage, as he/she will have first crack at the valuable IOUs. In a 3-player game, where the starting money is $60, each credit is precious. I was the first player, but I rolled so poorly that I did not get to a nearby system fast enough; the third player rolled higher and got there first and grabbed the IOU. I was effectively the last player at that point, and never recovered.

I have gone last in a 6-player game, and I recall the situation was the same. All the nearby IOUs were snatched up by the players ahead of me, so I effectively fell farther and farther behind. It is very difficult to catch up in this kind of situation. Unless the leader(s) roll poorly several turns in a row, the $2000 game is pretty much theirs. A $3000 game is still too short it seems for such a "broken" start, so I will have to try a $4000 game is see if the early leaders can be overcome. Alternatively, I wonder if there are variants giving the later players extra credits (like in Nexus Ops) to compensate for a late start. A house rule may be in order. Still, I enjoy this game immensely and look forward to many more plays.

Update (11/19/11): A $4000 game clocks in at about three hours for two players. At this point, factories and bigger ships start to make sense. The variant Scow with a combo drive can be game-breaking, as well as being the first to discover the Wraith (the 15th culture introduced in the "Lost Planet" variant). The $4000 game doesn't seem that any longer than a $3000 game, and allows the players to fully exhaust cultures of their trade goods. I wonder how this would work with 3 players? 4 players to $4000 may be a bit much. We'll see.

Update (11/20/11): A 3 player game to $4000 clocks in at three hours.

I am beginning to get annoyed with how the randomness of the dice can pretty much ruin the game for some players. If one has a bad start (like I did--and it seems to be a pattern), it is extremely difficult to make up for lost time, even in a longer game. The game has a tendency to magnify both poor and good plays, such that it has a very narrow range for error. The first player to luck out and stumble into a lucrative trade route, with enough cash to take immediate advantage of it, will likely win. After that, it seems to be an economic snowball that cannot be stopped, and there is nothing more frustrating than watching the game slowly slip away. The opening play seems to dictate who will win also, as whomever wanders into "The Cloud" will mostly likely lose. I will have to monitor the situation more closely. Am I missing something?

Although MoV seems to be multi-player solitaire, there is much to consider in terms of strategic information, such as the "observing" and noting the location of specific cultures--exposing one too early may give another player an advantage, allowing them to swoop in and exploit the opportunity you've uncovered. One must also monitor the status of specific goods, as it is possible to completely "suck dry" a culture of goods, thereby denying a following player to buy goods there, disrupting his/her trading rhythm. In contrast, in Empire Builder, the players are essentially isolated from each other (although denying goods and city access is still a real possibility, but more a result of circumstance than of deliberate play).

Update (12/31/11): In a 3-player game to $4000, one person got a huge lead early on, grabbing IOUs wherever they went, while another player and I struggled. However, the leader made some poor choices mid-game and languished. I held back on purchasing bases and went for the scow (one of the variant ships: 3.5 holds, roll 4x dice, use 2x), got a yellow, then red, then a combo drive, and started making 3x good deliveries along a flexible circuit of systems every turn. If not for some bad rolls and one or two missteps, I sufficiently caught up. The leader won by only one dice roll. If he did not make his roll, I would have won on my turn. This means that an early bad start can be mitigated, and it is possible to catch up, provided the leader stagnates mid-game.

Update (02/17/12) 15 plays: A 4-player game to $4000 took close to 4.5 hours. It really depends on how the cultures lay out. It is generally agreed that the 3rd and 4th players in a 4-player game are at a disadvantage, so we tried giving $5 and $10 extra to them respectively. It didn't matter--the first player grabbed the closest IOU and then lucked out in finding another culture nearby to start the snowballing on the rest of us. It seems if the first culture has high-payoff goods, such as 8, 9a, or 9b, they're off to a good start; eventually they'll find a culture that wants the good. In a 2-player game, the first player found #10 and bought one psychotic sculpture, and then was lucky to find the neighboring system to be #1a! Sometimes, it's just dumb luck. Is this a problem? If so, then how do we correct this? Are their variants to address this issue? I don't see any yet.

Update (02/25/12) 17 plays: The first player hitting the Qossuth in the nearby Cobbleport/Comfort Station system is a game-breaker. Picking up the 120 IOU, they can buy 1x psychotic sculpture for 160. There is roughly a 1-in-3 chance they'll hit a culture that will buy it for 250, for a 90 gain. In most games I've experienced, this early 90 delta is insurmountable, because the 1a or 1b culture was right next door! The same could be said of the Volois, where they have a 120 IOU also, and can easily buy Volois silk for 140 and sell for 220 for an 80 delta. Again, being the last player in a 4-player game sucks; even 20 extra doesn't help. Everyone agrees that hitting the "1a" or "10" culture in the first two systems is game-breaking. We'll try a variant to ensure not to seed those systems with those two cultures.

Update (04/21/12) 21 plays: We've experimented with two variants: A) 1st and 2nd players get no adjustment in starting cash, but 3rd player gets an additional $10, the 4th player gets $20, and so on [(n-2)*10, where "n" is the number of players]. If 1st player (as well as the 2nd player) doesn't reach one of the first two nearby systems, he gets (n-1)*10 additional cash. This tends to smooth over the unfair advantage the 1st and 2nd player enjoy in getting early IOUs, as well as provide a safety net if the 1st player rolls poorly. B) Take out both the Qossuth and the Volois "First Contact" IOUs and seed the two closest systems (i.e., Cobbleport/Comfort Station and Bypass) with two other randomly chosen IOUs. Then, mix in the Qossuth and Volois into the mix and seed as usual. This ensures that the first two systems are not one of these two highly lucrative cultures. This ensured a more challenging game.

Update (12/01/2013) 32 plays: I am getting tremendous enjoyment out of the Dathkaden [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32488/mov-custom-map-v2]remake[/url]. With the subsidy home rule mentioned above, it seems to smooth out the initial unfairness of first and second player advantages, as well as bad initial die rolls. Several players that have played the 2nd edition MoV have mentioned that FFG has gone too far in messing around with the mechanisms, and thus have altered the charm of the game. Therefore, they prefer the original rules. The Dathkaden artwork and components seal the deal. Even though there are a few weaknesses, this is a great "classic" game. No one in my group turns down an offer to play this. As the AH classic version, it's an "8", because of fiddly chits and bland artwork. But with the Dathkaden version, this is a "10".

The RATHER high silly factor adds a lot to this game.  The names of the goods and the aliens do a lot to keep me engaged.  The changing demand reminds me of Parthenon, as does the slightly random attempts to get from one place to another.  The Clue-esque roll-and-move, plus the downtime, slow the game down quite a bit, reminding you that it's quite an old one after all... but it's fun carting goods around space in a somewhat unpredictable but (you hope) profitable manner.

This wasn't the first non-mainstream game I played (I think that was Talisman 3rd), but it was the first one I played when I had any sort of income at all with which to seek out and purchase more board games.  I basically consider Merchant of Venus to be my impetus into the hobby.

It's also a fantastic game, and probably the one I'd grab on my way out if my house was aflame.

This is based on one playing of the game.  This game has a lot going for it themewise and I can understand why some people love it.  However, I found the game to be too long for its depth.  We played a short variant (by halving the $$$ for the win), but it still seemed to take forever to play.  No doubt experienced players can play the full game in the time it took for our shortened game.  However, fiddling with the numerous counters and constant rolling to move the game just seemed to drag.  I don't believe that this is truly a bad game.  It simply was not my cup of tea.

Too fiddly, outdated and long to compare to other good pick-up and delivery games. Rates a 5 if playing without combat as it does not keep you as interested. Overrated slightly on the GEEK from nostalgia and the fact it involves aliens and is a space game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great game which could use a rules facelift.  Some of the rules make the game unnecessarily long and tedious by making it take extra turns to accomplish things that really only need to take one turn.  This game is far better with 3 or 4 players.  Any more than that and it takes waay too long.  Another semi-issue is the shear number of chits involved.  It's kind of a pain to put the game away at the end.  In addition to that, some people suffer from analysis paralysis while trying to plan out their optimal trade route.

However, what the game lacks in these areas is made up for with an overabundance of fun!  Personally, I enjoy the opportunistic routes, the trickiness of space navigation, and the immersive theme.  You will feel like Hans Solo while you play.

TRADED: recieved Imperial and Tide of Iron for this game.

Merchant of Venus is what it is, a pickup-and-deliver exploration race which rewards tactics, opportunism, and medium-term strategy.  It's not a game for players who dislike randomness.  Randomness abounds and sometimes the consequences can be downright unfair.  On occasion, for the unskilled player the randomness can lead to a driftless early game where nothing seems to go right and the other players seem to be in hyperdrive while you're stuck in your busted-up little trading scow.  This even happens to skilled players from time to time, but with much less frequency.

So what's so special about this game?  In part, the sense of discovery as the galaxy is explored, which is impossible to orchestrate without the randomness.  The $3000 game balances several different ship types marvelously; I won't play to any other game length.  Finding the optimal routes is not always obvious, especially when another player tries to jump in ahead.  The rulebook flavor text is a delightfully excessive example of 80's gaming indulgence, thoroughly unnecessary but hilarious.  I often find myself reading sections of the backstory out loud during gameplay.  And the game does reward skill; I see the same players always in contention.

Are the parts of Merchant of Venus worthy of the highest rating?  Maybe not in and of themselves.  But the whole is.  Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't mind longer games and can tolerate a generous amount of chance.

Preordered the FFG version, as it appears the changes for the Classic version are either changes I appreciate (like the Colony World nav circle) or changes I'm not invested in one way or the other, like the different payouts.  I'm not sure I will like that factory goods can now satisfy demands but I don't think it will make too much difference.

A pickup and deliver in which the first half of the game is players flying around to flip over tiles in the hopes of getting a powerful technology to add to their ship. Now there are not only these technologies but some tiles that have negative effects or portals that will help ships jump great distances. Finally there are planets which will be discovered and demand certain items for purchase and have a particular good to sell. 

At some point the game turns towards the pickup and deliver part of the game. However, the game winner could have already been decided just based on how well he flipped up those tiles that may have powerful technologies on them.

For me there are many better pickup and deliver games out there so I have no real need to play this one again.

**Update (7/10): After 8 plays, I'd say this is potentially a 10. The proper way to play is 20 goods in the initial setup (no demand) with 4 chits coming in for each culture discovered. Very rewarding game. 

**Update: after four plays, I'm considering a 9 rating for this game. Just need to get in one or two longer games (3000 credits).

A game where you customize your spaceship (variable speed and cargohold), plan routes between planetary systems, purchase goods from exotic cultures, and sell them many moons away at a tidy profit. 

There's a lot of randomness here - undeserved boons and dearths - but also an invigorating breadth of options, a real sense of exploration, a robust system of wealth generation, variable demand, customizable spaceships, a wild assortment of interstellar goods ("psychotic sculpture," "Rock Videos," "Immortal Grease"), and room to play as best you can. There's a lot of wonky math, but most of the decisions aren't of the lame budget-hacking variety you sometimes see in contemporary "economic" games. Instead, you must often decide how much you want to help another player in order to help yourself. For example, if they own a trading station in a system with demand for your goods, they will earn wealth in addition to your sales (not as a cut), and you will do business a lot faster and be able to move on to the next opportunity. Is your speed of play worth a moderate cash infusion for an opponent? A lot of the game here is racing to provide other players with incentives to use your services.

Considering that this is an Avalon Hill classic, this is a surprisingly light pick up and delivery game. The basic rules are only 8 pages long. With 3.5 hours (4 players) it's playable in a long evening. The amount of luck involved might be too high for some players at that duration. But as the game succeeds in evoking an atmosphere of being interstellar traders, the experience is worth it without too much fiddliness involved. Skip the optional combat rules. Playing for the basic $2,000 left already enough room for different strategies to evolve.

RATING: 8
I found this games excellent for two reasons - 1. Initial exploration of planets and finding of relics (relics are upgrades for your ship). 2. The demand system for goods is second to none. If you have 5 Space spice counters in your hold then you look for the planet that has the most demand counters for Space spice and race your fellow gamers to that location. Demand counters give bonus $ but disappear as that commodity is received so the bonuses get smaller as the demand goes down.

However, there are a couple of problems with the game. It's hard to peg back the leader. We've found that the leader by mid-game is usually the winner at the end. Perhaps, some random events such as are found in The London Game or Starfarers of Catan?
Also, the solitaire rules totally suck and are broken. If anyone has fixed them please email me.

Strategy - Explore early but not for too long, make a quick couple of trades for bucks, upgrade your engines so that when your rolling mvmnt dice you're skipping every 1st or 2nd travel dot, make sure your hold's always full and look for those demand counters.

Sometimes we ignore the random movement in the cloud section of the board to speed up game play. (This makes one of the relics obsolete but so what.)

Apart from that it's a real blast and for what it is I haven't seen it's equal yet.

I played the basic version of this frequently over a couple years but that was a couple of decades ago but it was phased out when I started to have more and more non-gaming time commitments and lost patience for longish games of this type.  Recently it has come back on my radar due to a friend in my game club.  I tried the rail games he so want people to play with him but I just can't get into them so I decided to try this again as it is another of his favorites.  We played a short re-teaching game and now I want to play it every weekend for a while to get to know it really well.  The trouble is that I may be more interested in some of the variants than he is.

Pick up and deliver in space.  Interesting decisions abound although dice can cause some luck regarding movement.  Each game will be different as the different species can be located in different galaxies each time.  As well, the chit pull for goods,bonuses, and passengers is luck of the draw.  Bonuses exist to make the lower value goods more palatable to carry as cargo.  Games will take a fair bit of time, particularly with four or more players.

Interesting pick up and deliver game that has much of the feel of crayon rail games.  Like those games it also has downtime problems with large numbers of players.  I like the asteroid exploration and the way in which penalty spaces and "pilot number" spaces affect your movement.  I have not played with the combat version.

Had a more recent play with several players (at least 4) and was pleasantly surprised. It's a tough group and they liked it as well. Added players booted the tension level.

Played once with my son at Xmas - game was fun while you were originally moving around and did not know where things were. Once that was over - and my son had a large lead it lost a bit... All in all OK

Only plays (in recent memory) were 2 player but that was pretty fun. Roll and move done well, fun to set up the little trade routes as well as exploring space. Plus the humor in the game of the different goods (something Firefly lacks). I'd like to get it played again. Not sure when that is likely to happen, as it is not my game and we already have more long games than opportunities to play them.

This game is annoying to set up and take down, but its so different every time you play that it still hasn't gotten old for me. This is a bit more luck dependent than contemporary Euro games, but the game is deep enough to overcome that. Still a great game.

This game is the AH version.  I would not play this due to component quality but the print and play edition with the updated art is very nice.  I would recommend the Fantasy Flight edition which does have some problems, but it terms of value for the money and the two games, I would go with FF.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games (and not just because I ended up winning the 1993 Avaloncon tourney for MoV).  I really enjoy the exploration aspect, making every game a little different.  It also has a lot of interesting decisions for using a roll and move game mechanic.  Play to $2,000 and every game ends leaving you wanting to play just a little longer, unless you play with the full complement of 6 players, which is a little too much.  One additional, unecessary anecdote:  I once won a bet by setting up the game in under 5 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
This game has a long history and it's interesting that such a dated title has hung on this long. It doesn't seem particularly interesting from a modern perspective but it is a good deal of fun. The economy is modeled pretty simplistically but it works just fine and you'll find yourself travelling across the galaxy just to get to that demand token. The goods themselves are also very entertaining. Try not to get lost in the cloud.

11/2007 First AH$2000 6-player session without optional rules.  Winner had only AH$1300 when we had to wrap-up after 3 hours.  The game has potential and lots of it.  But very limited player-interaction along some down-time between moves leaves me with an rather ambivalent impression.  Perhaps a 4-player game with some variants will make it a better game.

RATING: 9.2
Fluffed rating as we have the privledge of playing on an extremely high quality custom made version of the game. HomeIslander has printed, lamenated, used nickel holders for most of the game pieces, a large lamenated map and money cards, painted minis for the space-ships and large spaceship cards. Excellent artwork on everything and the layout covers a tremendous amount of tablespace that creates a fantastic setting and clear and easy reference of all the game pieces. 
With all this, the game transforms into something bigger than itself and makes for a very in-depth, strategic and opportunistic exploration and commodity exploitation game. We played at 6 players and didn't seem to bogged down in the down time, since you're constantly having to readjust and respond to new demands, new market opportunities and trade routes. I am particularly a fan of games that employ of lot of thought and a lot of strategy. This game affords this in the realm of managing your funds. 
Do you sacrifice buying a more expensive ship to buy the more expensive goods that are in demand, do you go for the small cargo fast ship, or the slow but large cargo ship? 
Do you focus on fairing "hitchhickers" or do you go after the demand items. 
Do you build a factory on the planet and pick-up the expensive goods, or do you simply build a spaceport and keep moving fast around the galaxy? 
Do you spend the extra travel time and free up more cargo space, or do you purchase the improved drives to speed around more quickly?
You also, have to plan out your trade routes well and have good back-up routes in the event that someone exhausts all the goods on the planet or reduces all the demand for the items you planned on shipping. 
Do you chance going through the gates or do you take the secured routes? 
Very enjoyable game, but the rating is fluffed by 1.5 with the hightend quality of the gameboard, pieces and elements provided by HomeIslander.

The way the goods and bonuses are restocked when other goods are sold is a nice mechanism. I love the exploration mechanic and figuring out best routes and opportunities which change all the time.

Also, there are lots of variants and extensions and the game is already very re-playable, but when I get sick of using the same board, I know there's a modular board with hexes here in BGG too :) 

The solitary variant is a bit too difficult...

I haven't played many Pick Up & Deliver games, but this one seems to be the cream of the crop.  Fun Theme, neat mechanics.  More dice rolling and luck than other pick up and delivers seem to have, but that seems to add to the fun.  I have to play this more to really get a full grasp.

A really fun trading game.  After playing the AH version in high school, I made my own version recently with the updated art on BGG.  I think the length is best with 3 players, but the decisions are most interesting with 4 players.  Maybe as my friends and I get the hang of it, we can get a 4 player game done in a better time span.  In high school, I remember liking the combat rules a lot, but I didn't make those pieces yet, so I can't comment on recent experience.

One of my favorite 'commodity delivering' games (Okay.. 'train game' with spaceships instead). Dropped it a point for its very long setup time in setting up all the chits everywhere.

Pretty good economics game.  I had reservations about playing, but quite enjoyed my game.  Some interesting choices, and the variable board would keep the game interesting over repeated play.  We played to the $2000 limit with 4 new players in about 2.5 hours, so it moved along well.  A pleasant surprise.  Have since gotten the game for myself and lost badly at a solo session: getting the flow of it takes some time, and the combat I've not yet appreciated, but I can see the strength of the design.

Jan '16:  excellent game that I am not good at.  Need to learn to buy stations and factories.  I vow to win this game someday!

RATING: 6
Rating based on one recent play only (1'st play was a very long time ago...).

First game was too long (4 players, $2,000 took 4hrs+ !!)... hopefully this will shorten with more experience. Group played slowly with a lot of rules checking.  2-3 hrs would be optimal imo.

A trading/pick up and deliver game with good thematic elements... add some plastic miniatures, tweak the graphics, some of the mechanics and this could maybe be an Ameritrash space trading game classic.  

Ok... not truly an Ameritrash game but shares some of the characteristics:  good tie between game mechanics and theme, significant random elements, longish, has that "retro" game feel.

A redesigned/faster playing/streamlined MOV with modern pieces and updated graphics (new graphics would also increase playability) would be an excellent addition to the gaming world (I think).  Will look into Duck Dealer.

Replayability aspect is high with culture discovery mechanic.  Rules are complex enough that we played a few things wrong on our first game.  I expect the game will get better with more plays.

Less overwhelming the second time around. After third play, game's elegance and balance blossoms.

Merchant of Venus is a race to acquire a net worth of $2,000 by finding lucrative trade routes among alien cultures. You pilot a spaceship with a couple of cargo holds for transporting valuables such as 'Space Spice' or 'Rock Videos' from one planet to the next. You make money by buying goods at a low price from one culture and selling them for a profit to another culture. The game features 14 cultures (each on their own planet). The tricky part is that your newly acquired goods can only be sold at a few other locations. For example, goods purchased from culture #1 can only be sold to cultures #2-4. And to really make things interesting, at the start of the game all cultures are randomly distributed facedown. So early exploration just to find a good trade route is key.

There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made such as whether or not to upgrade your ship, build factories or spaceports, search for valuable relics, attempt to take the shortcut through the clouds, etc. There is also a fair amount of luck since your ship is fueled by die roll. The strategy vs. luck factor is well balanced to the point that an experienced player should beat a rookie, but if enough breaks fall just right, a lucky player could pull off an upset.

The game plays well with 1-4 players. More than four tends to bog down as player turns take longer and longer as the game progresses and decision trees grow. To speed things up, I provide each player with their own set of dice and a box lid to roll them into (throwing the dice on the game board could be disasterous).

Be cautioned that this game takes 15+ minutes to set up so a good host will take care of that before the guests arrive. Playing time ranges from 90 minutes to three hours but you can tailor that to your group's needs by adjusting the victory conditions between $1,000 to $4,000. My favorite is to play to $3,000 as it makes the slow freighter worth consideration. Our group also likes to sweeten the '?' markers with all the relics, telegates, and few penalty markers. Don't bother with the combat version of nova balls and lasers, as this plays best as an economic race, not a wargame.

List of variants / house-rules used [I'm finding this mix supports a wide variety of strategies and play styles]:

- Combat rules for blasting penalty markers and Rastur [i]only[/i] [no PvP]. Rastur enter on [b]double[/b] 1's, appear in sequentially increasing values, and are assigned to a system by 1d10 [+odds/evens roll if needed for a/b]. If indicated culture is not discovered, Rastur do not appear. For combat, Rastur roll no dice. Rastur and all penalty markers pay [b]double[/b] their face value upon defeat. 

- "Expansion set" of fan-brewed content, including [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32570/variant-ships-for-mov]variant ships[/url], [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32543/special-crew-exp-for-mov-by-roberto-ullfig]special crew[/url], [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32603/lost-planet-variant-version-b]Lost Planet B[/url], [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32525/mining-colonies-variant-components-for-mov]Mining Colonies[/url] [[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32525?commentid=3620013#comment3620013]modified slightly[/url]], and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32520/ersatz-relics-expansion-new-components-for-mov]Ersatz Relics[/url] [modified so that ersatz relics also take no cargo space]. We find this a really nice mix to provide a wealth of player options and game-to-game variability without compromising the essentials of the game or adding significant overhead.

This set of options helps to make the board topologically different for each player based on their ship, equipment, and crew.

Setup time is too long.  Essential strategy for the $2000 game is:  get a clipper and no drives.  Find a route and chase bonuses.  If you decide to go one direction and end up on the inefficient side of the board you will lose, and that is hidden at the beggining of the game.  Addendum.  GREAT 2 player game, not too long, so you can play to 3000 or 4000 and then there's a lot of depth.

I do not play it any more very often. I've won this game 30 to 40 times in a row and when I sit down to play it at all now my hands get sweaty because I fear to loose - too sad.

When playing it at all I select the Quossuth (custom ships rule) since they are quite luck-dependend (one die times 4) and therefore it is still a challenge to win with the Quossuth.

Played once.
Feels a little like Space Empires: 4X, with the space theme, and exploring to reveal civilisations and technologies.  But trade, ship upgrades, and the demand/replenish cycle make this something even more interesting!  Thinky, a bit of planning, a dose of luck, and it doesn't over-stay its welcome.
Haven't played combat.

I have Michael Christopher's (Dathkaden) beautiful remake of this game.  A ton of work to do (actually insane amount of work would be more accurate), but the best remake of the game I have seen.

When played, the game has an intense amount of stuff going on, on the board.  Gets busy and cluttered.  At times hard to follow.  I really like the simple game mechanics in it though.  The game starts out with you scraping to get by, but by the end money adds up quickly.  If people play the game half way decently, the game ends very close and you really don't know who is going to win until the end.  Good game.

Many people consider Merchant of Venus to be a train game. I don‚Äôt think it really fits into this category, since it is primarily concerned with exploration and delivery, and not network construction. Each player is in control of a spaceship and will explore regions of space, upgrade their vessel, pick up and deliver goods, and construct stations and factories that affect how sales happen. Movement is handled by die rolls, but there are various upgrades that can be found or purchased by the players to affect movement.

The randomness of the movement is often a point of contention about the game, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really a major roadblock. Improving your ship is a necessary part of this game, and ignoring that fact is more often what does a player in. If you die rolls do not allow you to travel along the path you‚Äôd prefer, you can often choose an alternate, although perhaps less efficient path instead. If you‚Äôre just rolling each turn waiting for the one number you need, you‚Äôre bound to set yourself back.

The game can be considered ‚Äòmathy‚Äô, because there is always the constant considering of what is going to get you the best profit, but after a few plays, the choices become more obvious. What I really like about the game is that playing with the different victory conditions can change how you choose to approach the game. Certain strategies favor a short game, where others work best with a longer game.

In the end, this is an optimization game. You need to check out the network, see where the good trade routes are and exploit them better than the other players. When played with three, the best number in my opinion, you usually start differently enough where each player isn‚Äôt necessarily going after the same condition, but you can change your plans to affect others.

I have not played any of the variants for this game, so I cannot comment on those. From what I hear, the combat variant is not that great, especially considering how infrequently you actually encounter other players. Perhaps this would be different in a game with more players, but at that point the game becomes too unwieldy for my tastes.

Important to victory is knowing what goods to buy, where to deliver, when to upgrade, and when to purchase stations and factories. As far as standard goods go, you should always be aware of what goods have demands present. This is the best way to maximize your profit margin. Obviously, higher priced goods give better profits, but often you can do well with cheaper goods if there are multiple demands. For example, Finest Dust costs $10 and sells for $50 for a profit of $40 per good. With two demands (worth $50 each), selling two of these gives you a profit of $230, with an initial investment of only $20. Compare this to the most expensive good, Servo-Mechanisms, which cost $200 and sell for $300 giving only a profit of $100.

Fares can be good as a bonus, or if they are on your way, but you don‚Äôt usually want to go out of your way to deliver them. If you‚Äôve got half a hold free, due to a drive taking up space, and you are somewhere with a fare, there is no reason not to pick him up since there is no penalty if you simply eject him.

Having two holds available is often better than having one hold on a faster ship, since it rarely takes twice as long to get somewhere with three dice instead of four. For this reason, I think the upgrade to the Transport is stronger than the Clipper. The benefit here is that if you discover a race that sells Transports, you can often use the IOU towards much of the cost. The best use for the Clipper may be if you are planning on travelling through the cloud. The Freighter is rarely a good purchase, unless you are playing a high-value victory condition, then it may be decent when combined with both drives.

Shields and drives also play an important part in the game. It is practically a given that a player will want to buy a shield during the game, since it saves $10 to $20 on any hazard space, it will pay for itself in two uses. The drives are another matter. This is more dependent on the board layout and what ship you are using, but it is often good to have one drive. The Yellow Drive can be purchased in full with two of the three yellow IOUs, so it is naturally the most likely candidate. The trouble is it will reduce your cargo hold, so unless you have three spots, you generally want to keep your hold open. Being able to trade two goods at a time can be more important than speed.

Stations are vital to success in this game. If you can place stations along the paths where high profit trade routes are, you can improve on all of your trades, and possibly convince others to use your stations as well. Always buy stations in your home system, unless there is absolutely no profit to be made. You get a discount on them, so you‚Äôre already ahead when you purchase them.

Factories are usually a later game purchase, unless you get a good amount of capital early in the game. The best way to deal with factories is to purchase both the factory and the good at the same time. This way, you get the good at a discount, which will greatly improve your profit. Also, if you do this at one of your stations, you get the added 10% bonus.

RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): We played a bit modified game as we didn't have battles and we played until 3000 money was acquired. We also used a redone(?) graphics which were supposed to be superior to old ones and they were good. Perhaps my only complain about them is that they use the name of goods only used on demand-tokens. I would prefer system's number instead, as I tend to remember those much better...It sounded a bit weird to take whole battle system away (don't know really how it works) but after the game I felt that I wasn't really missing anything. Perhaps there could be a bit use to it if someone would get super lucky then you would have means to do something to it but most likely battles just lengthens the game and adds yet another level of chaos on top of it. 

The game as played such as we did had a good ratio of control/chaos already, at least to my taste. There is bigger randomness how systems turn out and how what comes from space tokens. Also how demand-tokens and resupply of used tokens come has an element of luck and NOT to forget movement (dices) but at least I felt that game was won more by clever playing than beign lucky (I was last...). Surely on a tighter game luck definitely plays a big part, especially if you're one point short from making it to a space station.

I liked the economy part where building space stations gives you 10% bonus of every transaction that happens on a station and other players have a reason to use others stations because it is more effective (unlimited number of sell/buy's available) than going to neutral cities. The gameplay otherwise is trying to maximize your profits but there is balancing whether to change a ship (and into which model) and whether to buy enchantments that give you benefits but take up your precious cargo space. After every (or nearly every) system is discovered the game is perhaps a bit too repetitive task of just running goods from a system to another. I liked the game but length (3-4 hours in our group) is a bit too much to be a real gem.

Update: I won second game too easily by just getting a bit lucky on first system I found (red drive) and later a relic (yellow drive). This boost gave me too easy win and I felt that there is too much luck for such a lengthy game. Dropped rating to 6 because of this. Shame, as I like the system. Battles might negate this but I'm not sure it is a real answer to problem.

The best of the old Avalon Hill games that I own. We play without the rules for pirating each other. The key element is speed and the decision each player stand in front of is when to sacrifice speed for trade and explore. Building spaceports yield both faster trades and the owner a trade-commission, even for rivals business there! You may still have to trade at a rivals spaceport to maintain speed. The game allows only one ship (that can be traded in for a larger or faster) per player but that works fine for this game. How I wish that AH would have made more games like this one.

After reading so many good comments, I was very very disappointed. And only during the play I understood what other people mean saying, that the game is long! The games seems to be long because after discovering the profitable route you do nothing else just earning money by repeating the same actions. And that's all!
The board of the game is also painful, because navigation circles will lead you somewhere but not there where you wish!

Your first game should be solo. That way you can learn the different chits, random setup, races, goods, et al. Playing with the my 2 kids was a lot of fun. A commerce (buy-sell) model with a loose sci-fi theme. The random starting locations makes for a different winning game strategy each time you play. For a short game, change the winning total to $1000 rather than $2000 ... and even then the game takes awhile.

RATING: 7
Lots of interesting stuff going on, exploring the universe, constructing profitable trade routes from what's found, deciding the right kind of spacecraft to use, whether to build spaceports and factories, etc. It's surprisingly decent for an older game, and you can set the winning cash condition for the length of game you like. It's a pick-up-and-deliver game, with movement by dice, but with lots of ways to bring movement more under your control. Turns are generally fast, with the occasional reflection required on where best to go from here when easy deliveries aren't nearby. The rules aren't great, but once digested, and with a decent player aid, the game is fairly simple to explain and get going. It's a little fiddly with all the goods chits coming and going as they're delivered and replacements come on board, but all in all, it's solitaire-y type pick-up-and-deliver fun/challenge for the occasional play once you've grokked it, but there's probably too much randomness for it to come out much more than occasionally. We play the "General" variant where demand chits are included in the setup to make the start more interesting, and we ignore all the optional rules so as to keep the system clean.

What I like:
- Fun theme, with cool types of goods.
- Works well with no pvp combat
- I like pickup-and-deliver games

What I don't like:
- Learning 2p game took 3+ hours
- Lots of chits to sort, put out, manage, and store
- The roll and move isn't horrible, but feels dated

This is a pretty complicated game, so I would give it a 3.5 weight rather than the 2.8 voted by BGG users. 

Our learning game probably would have been 30 to 60 minutes shorter if we had started building factories sooner. I could see it getting down to 2 hours with practice. Still quite long and fiddly. 

I want to like it, and there are many aspects I like, but it's just too long and fiddly. I could see an updated MoV-light being fun to play.

Now this is pick-up-and-deliver done very well.  The best part is the automatic bookkeeping built-in by having all the info on the counters and such a wonderful supply and demand system.  Movement via dice can be a bit frustrating but also provides a necessary element of the unpredictable.  Buy the Avalon Hill version for the rich and humorous presentation.

This is a really cool pick-up-and-deliver game.  I had a lot of fun trying to build up my spaceship and holdings while trying to make money, and moving around the board was varied and fun.  The chit-pulling mechanic as well as determining what planets buy what goods are both very clever.  The game does take a long time to play, but I found it enjoyable the entire way through.

Played 5-6 times face-to-face, a dozen times solitaire. I love the theme and generally the mechanics (explore, build, research, develop, trade, etc.). I've tired of fiddling with all the components, and can get my "trading game fix" with other titles today. Will probably continue to break it out once every 3 years, which is about the rate now. VERY 1980's, with paper counters, board, rules, plastic pawns. 3/27/10: traded away with 6/General magazines for Primordial Soup + Dune (French edition). Was never going to get played again anyway.

This was a interesting game, however the rule with regard to landing the first time on a planet and only being able to buy and sell one product makes it very slow.  No one wanted to invest in a space station since other players could use it (despite the 10% kick back).  I'm sure it was put in place to make the space station more valuable to players to invest in.  Just doesn't seem right some how.  The game could be redone.

There seems to be an online game that is similar, titled Escape Velocity or EV Nova from Ambrosia Software.

A classic "Ameritrash" game, complete with lots of dice-rolling and chit-pulling. We've found it necessary to house-rule the "Rastur" and the combat rules a bit.

I am so luck to have a chance to play it in 2008, 20 years after the game was published. It is a good trading game. I am not talking the trading between the players; I mean trading with the "game". I love playing the game with "trading" element. 

The theme of the game is very good. As a merchant, players travel around the planet and space station; buying the goods from where it produces to some others place which need the goods. 

The game is a bit long; we took three and a half hour for playing once. But please understand that the games which published long time ago are always "long".

I hope Avalon Hill will reprint this game. :)

I will only play with three players as that seems to have the right balance of time and interaction.  With only three routes out of the start, four (or more) players starts with someone following behind at the start.  Interesting to watch the trade routes develop, but once the board is nearly exposed, it becomes a game of optimizing a few trade routes.  At which point the game can feel a bit repetitive and wear out its welcome if it drags on.

Great fun.  Much of it is a "see how the ride turns out" kind of experience, but there's just enough opportunity for educated guesses and daring gambits to make it still scratch an actual gaming itch for me.  Proof that not all old games suck.

----------

I was very excited to play MoV because I love economic games and pickup/deliver games, but I ultimately walked away disappointed.  I would've preferred variable race powers and supply/demand simulation.  However, since demand is always static (aside from the occasional, random flat-bonus chits), the profit margins are always the same, so some games will have very obvious trading networks that see a majority of the action, making the rest of the board somewhat abandoned.  

Furthermore, I consider this game to be far too experiential to take seriously, and that's not a bad thing -- but it's also not MY thing.  I don't care too much for experiential games, but some people, so this may not be a detractor for them.  I just feel that there aren't enough compelling decisions to justify the length of the game.

--Mar2009-- Thanks to Richard for the explanation!  The game is, admittedly, "just" a pickup-and-deliver romp.  But amidst the fog of tiny late 80's counters, there's a pretty cool game hiding in plain sight.  Very enthusiastic about playing again.
--May2009-- After a few games, I'm still quite enthusiastic.  And, fortunately for me, my eldest is also quite happy to play.  I'm not quite sure what the allure is, but the combination of exploration, route-planning, and modest push-one's-luck is cool.

Great game, I always loved to play it, but haven't played it since I was a youngin'.  Space exploration, planetary discovery, trading of funny goods, a real supply and demand system, mysterious relics, and bizarre sentient species -- what's not to love? The long setup time and extensive raiding of your mug collection may turn some people off, but it never bothered me. In any case there are many variants available to shorten setup. My opinion of this game is assuredly based on numerous memories of having played it during my golden age of gaming (aged 16 to 22), so the score is probably skewed up a few sentimentality points.

Holy Impossible Furniture!  What a fab game.  Really, the funnest pick-up and deliver game I've played. This system is so elegant for how complex and fiddly it is.  So many fun choices, sit a turn out to buy and sell more or strafe sales on the run, get a larger cargo hold and lose movement or run quick moving fares and factory items.  Many fun concepts, there is a whole universe created here that isn't even in the gameplay (which in some ways is too bad). 

The pasted on combat variant feels, well, pasted on.  Was Avalon Hill afraid to put out a game without a combat system? 

My only two minor gripes are that the pawns suck (you need ships to replace them) and I wish each race had a minor special power to make you feel different. This seems best for two and three. The game system would work great for four but downtime would run way too high.  Six players is silly with rules as written. 

I'm tempted to create a player by player movement phase then simultaneous selling and buying phase with players first to a planet having the advantage. All sold chits go in a pile all replaced chits come after the phase.

This game is way too fun. It also have a jillion little bits, but they're cool bits. Nothing like hauling around some Chicle Liquor in the hull of your trusty ship. This game introduced me to a world of games outside of Risk and Yahtzee.... I'd never even heard of Avalon Hill until I stumbled into a game store and gave this puppy a try. I also love any game that I can also play solitaire, and it works great for that, whether you use the solitaire rules or just play all sides. Another one of those games where those small plastic boxes for fishing lures comes in handy to store the various bits. I would estimate at least 10+ additional plays of this game prior to my logging of plays starting 2005.

While definitely not in the "Euro" mode, this is a good game. I've played it once each with two and four players. It was slow going at first, but we soon got hang of the rules and play accelerated quickly. As a geek, I for some reason enjoy the logic behind the supply and demand mechanism used. It's also good that the game length can be configured. I've increased my rating from 6 to 7 after the second play.

Really, really cool economic game with a great sci-fi theme.  Granted, the cardboard chits aren't great, but this is from a different era.  I love the movement mechanic, with a "pilot" die to spin you around in different directions.  There's a bit of complexity in the exceptions, but really, it's just fly from one system to the next trying to make money by buying and selling goods.  I like how demand and goods get recycled as goods are sold from a chit draw.  Quite entertaining despite the length: playing to 2000 seems to be the sweet spot for me, as it would finish in about 3 hours.  Organizing the bits well is a must.

Reminds me of one of those old Apple II games I used to play, where you pilot a ship from planet to planet, buying and selling goods until you amass a fortune and win the game. There used to be pirates and other space hazards, which seem to be missing from MoV (maybe the Rastur are similar?). A nice take on the pick-up-and-deliver mechanism.

Variants Used:
Variant 1: Enforce that all 6 gates are in the game.
Variant 2: Fast Setup: Mix goods and fare bonus in a bag. Pick 20 markers to start. Each time a new culture is discovered, pick 4 more markers. Pick replacements as deliveries are made normally. Factory goods remain unavailable until the respective factories are built.
Variant 3: Advanced Exploration: (removes 1st player advantage in large games.) In your first turn, you may choose to start your pawn at either the Galactic Base or at any surface city or Space City in any system with a face up culture marker (e.g. that someone else discovered).

When a friend of mine was gushing about this roll and move game from 1988 I tried keeping my distance, but he kept on talking about it non-stop.  And then when he paid an arm and a leg for it on EBay, I thought I at least owe it to myself to play.  

I am glad I did.  Rolling 3d6 for movement is less chaotic than you might think and there are plenty of options, where to go, what goods to buy, what systems to deliver them too all add up to significant decisions every turn.  The board is not static, goods are added to systems and more systems become explored creating even more options.    

I instantly wanted to play it again immediately after playing.

Great theme play.  Easy to play and fairly easy to learn.  Game mechanics nothing special.  Game play has a heavy luck factor - dice for movement and chit draw for location of goods.  Would like a different set of victory conditions other than the monetary goal.  Components are about average - colorful mounted board, thick cardboard chits, & flimsy cards.  The rulebook was unclear on many points and was not well written.  Artwork is not very good.  Game length is OK but can drag.

[AH 1998 edition] {Merchant, space exploration; variable-player-power, pick-up-and-delivery; roll-and-move} [Basic 7.00, Combat 7.00, Solitaire 7.00, Rastur 7.00] Merchant of Venus is the best pick-up-delivery game in my collection.  It is thematic, multifaceted, strategic and interactive.  There are tile draws and dice rolls; but players have very good control of what they can do.  If someone says it is totally luck-driven; he must be a fool. It is also with high replayability.  This is really a classic game. 

[Game length] Journey Merchant is probably the best as the first game.  Master Merchant is good for a group of experienced players.  Trade Baron is just too long.

[Variant] Combat rule is not as fun as expected.  It seems AH does not want to include combats in the original design; however, they have to add it for marketing purpose.

Dare I say of all the AH titles this is the one that still gets the most play. More game "play" than most euro's in terms of strategies.

Maybe it was the pickup-and-deliver mechanics.
Maybe it was my ship being stuck in a gascloud for ages.
Maybe it was the little fiddly components.
Maybe it was the lack of interaction with my opponents.
Maybe it was the lack of a lot of players (4, while one had to leave mid-game).
Maybe it was because we were all first-timers to the game.
Maybe it was because the winner was well determined before the end.
Maybe it was the end of an intensive gaming day.

What I do know, is that despite winning the game by a clear margin, I didn't quite enjoy it. Which is not a good sign.

Despite it having some interesting traits, it seemed an outdated design to me, not as clear as Acquire, not as elegant as some modern Euro's, not holding the same surprises as a whole slew of modern boardgames.

Giving this a 5 merely because I can see it become more enjoyable with more players and more 'good snatching' as then the element of carefully planning your routes and the excitement of high-dice rolls becomes more prevalent. However, would rather be playing something else even if.

Pass. Will not be playing this again.

Random setups ensure the game is infinitely replayable.  After a slow initial explorations needed to discover alien races and efficient trade routes, different strategies may require for ship upgrades and buying goods, equipment and factories, etc.  Extra demands suddenly make some others goods juicier, and you must make adjustment to the opportunities.  On the whole a fun and involving game, with 2 to 4 the game would never bored. Just short of the perfect 10 because of the downtime and a bit on the long side.

RATING: 10
Overtly thematic games with lots of bits don't usually appeal to me. This one does. But I suspect that it's really the game's solid exploration and trade-route mechanics that keep me coming back. MoV never loses sight of its core tension, which elevates the game and all its quirks to the next level. That core is the race element, and it shines through despite the heavy coat of shiny thematic paint layered on top. While MoV is a pick-up-and-deliver game, it is also, and perhaps more so, a game about planning and adaptation on the fly and as quickly as possible.

First, let me talk about theme because, no matter how much (or little) you know about the game, the first thing that stands out is its whacky, old-school sci-fi cover. It's a game set in a futuristic vision of space where travel is easy, aliens are plentiful, and the universe looks a lot like Earth if it were inhabited by giant bugs and pint-sized furries (all of which are intelligent, of course). It's also a game about exploration. At the start of the game, the universe is unknown. Everything is facedown and hidden. It's up the players to discover where all the different species call home, and how to best navigate among the various worlds. If you have a certain predilection for kitsch, science fiction, and the joy of discovery, then MoV calls to you. That's the hook. That's the theme that beckons you in, but it's certainly not what keeps you coming back for game after game.

What makes MoV worth playing is its focus on economy and efficiency. You can divide the game into three phases. First comes nearly pure exploration. Everyone starts from the Galactic Base and fans out to uncover as many civilizations as possible, each one gaining the player a small one-time trade bonus. As the universe becomes more familiar, phase two starts and everyone tries to set up trade-routes. Because of the clever way in which goods are distributed, the minimum trade-route involves three locations. Practically, it's often more. And this is where players butt heads, because goods are limited, existing within an overall closed economy. So if I, for example, pick up all the Melf Pelts (I told you it was goofy), then that's it, there are no more. You'll have to wait until I sell those goods off, and even then you'll have to wait until the Melf Pelts are randomly drawn and placed on their home location again -- thereby simulating erratic production, but more importantly, a desperate need to beat me to market. If you miss your opportunity, you better be ready to adapt, and quickly; otherwise, you'll be left behind in the race for cash.

Finally, the third phase of the game sees everyone upgrade their ships and navigation equipment, becoming powerhouses of intergalactic transport. Players maximize their trade-routes, even if those routes are never stable. Demand tokens also become increasingly important. As planets build up demand for certain goods, the potential profits become too attractive to pass up, and players race to alter their normal circuit to satisfy huge profit centers.

And then the game ends. No one will accomplish everything they set out to do because MoV isn't played for points or for glory. It's played for fast cash. The first to a set amount, wins -- thereby cutting everyone else off before they have a chance to complete that last delivery, that last profit windfall. Finishes among experienced players can be nail-biters, coming down to the difference of just a single turn. And that is where the excitement lies. The game speeds up and up and up until the final turn when it's all over in an instant.

Is the game perfect? Of course not. Movement is by the roll of dice, which carry with them the danger of a bad streak of luck. There are also random asteroid spaces on the board. Early on, these spaces add to the feeling of exploration, but they can also grant an unfortunate penalty or lucky break. Get out out to a rough start and it can be difficult to catch up unless the dice favor you, or you happen to pick up a valuable piece of relic equipment to help close the gap. Luck, in other words, plays an essential part of the MoV experience. Yet it rarely overwhelms a strategy or ruins the gameplay.

What is most surprising is the way MoV builds its thematic experience on top of a solid core of game mechanics (and not the other way around). A few years ago, right around the time when gamers were embracing Eclipse, everyone was talking about the blending of Euro-style mechanics with Ameritrash-style thematics. Well, Merchant of Venus got there first in 1988, and it's still worth playing today.

Played once with 4-players. Lots of fun game with good theme and strategy. Luck of the dice roll. Plays a bit too long, but it doesn't feel like it. Perry Rhodan is a stream-lined 2-player version that plays very quickly, but it is only available in German.

Feels very modern despite using a roll-and-move mechanic that, in some games, would feel archaic.  Goes to show there are no bad mechanics, just mechanics used badly.

I'd like to also try FFG's revamped version, but only if I become more familiar with the classic.

Awsome game that i really wish wasn't out of print. Was alot of fun but i could see it getting bogged down with 5 players (too much down time as well) I enjoyed 3 players (i actually think that was optimal) but i think 4 would be fun as well.

Components become a little cumbersome and alot of information (it actually turned out to be a much simpler game than i anticipated) which leads to long set up and break down time.

Overall i would like to give this one another chance and i would like to see a reprint of it from AH as well.

RATING: 3
I don't see what the big deal is about this game. I think it's one of those situations of nostalgia or even worse the whole "This is a hard game to get your hands on so I have to say I like this game more than I typically do so that I can be in one of those elite groups of people who get to play games that you don't." SIGH. I'm not one to disregard a game based on randomness. Still this game is HEAVILY biased towards start player. I was 4th out of 5 so I was playing catch up even after the first turn of the game. I think a retooling of this game (as was done with Blackbeard) is certainly in order before a reprint needs to even be considered. 

UPDATE: I got to play Duck Dealer yesterday. I feel Duck Dealer is strongly inspired by Merchants of Venus. All the things I really don't like about MoV are cleaned up and fixed in DD. If you have played MoV and were less than pleased with it I can not stress to you enough to give DD a try. It's a have intense and heavy game despite the rubber duckie on the cover. Trust me DD is everything the MoV needed to be and more.

A fantastic space race game, with enough rewards for efficient route planning and wise economic decision making that the dice rolling for movement does not get too annoying. It takes a while to set up/tear down, and the cumulative downtime in 5/6 player games make them take too long.

About [thing=230][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
Is the essence of pick and delivery game, with a racing aspect (the first to X money). This mechanic counts for around 85% of the game, with the remaining 15% being exploration, ships upgrades, finding planets and revealing obscure points of the cosmos, building spaceports and factories, etc. And you will be bound to take goods and passengers from point A to point B for a long time, as the playing time clocks around 3 hours.

Therefore, the game is all about finding the best routes, trying to take the best deals, and make every stop counts towards the final goal.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
At first the board starts with all the planets in need to be explored - no one knows, beforehand, which place sell what and where to sell stuff - not even the home planets for the races of the players. In the turn the player can: move (by rolling 2 to 4 dice, depending on the type of ship) and if she manage, stop in a planet or trading post. In the planet - or trading post - the player can sell 1 good and buy 1 good. Buing for ship upgrades and building spaceports and factories count as a buy, therefore you can't build a spaceport and buy an upgrade or a good of the planet in the same turn.

 If the player builds or uses the spaceport of someone else, there is not limit to the amount of goods sold and bought - the player owning the post gets 10% of the amount of money spent and gained (this applies even if the spaceport is yours!).

Some races have science that allow the player to not only buy goods, but also purchase upgrades for the spaceship - these are shields, drives, and in some the possibility of changing your ship type for another - there are 4 types:
- Scout: the starting ship. Hold: 2 goods. Movement: 3 dice;
- Clipper: faster ship. Hold: 2 goods. Movement: 4 dice;
- Transport: balanced. Hold: 3 goods. Movement: 3 dice;
- Freighter: lots of space. Hold: 4 goods. Movement: 2 dice.

During the game, players will keep buying and selling goods, trying to attend to the demands of the planets, which make produts sell for a higher price. This requires a good amount of route planning, not only the starting and final destination, but everything in between, as, except with a Clipper with a combo drive, travel will usually demand a few stops along the way. So, even if you are in planet 4, which sells something that planet 11 wants, oh so badly, is probable that you might need to stop at planet 14 along the way. Maybe is best to take only one good from planet 4, and another in planet 14, this one not to sell in 11, but next to 11 is planet 3, and you can then sell that there, while taking its good to sell in... and so on.

The game will proceed until one player reaches a certain amount of money. When this happens, the game is over and the player wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What to buy and where to go. This isn't a difficult game to grasp at all. It do requires some vision not only to see what you will buy/sell next, but also your next step from there, and even the next after the next. This, of course, is if you want to play well. Otherwise, you can just live in the moment - hoping for some luck in the demands of the planets and/or in the appearance of passengers.

When and where to build spaceports (more than factories) can also serve the players well.

There are some tatical decisions during play, but most serve in a long term aspect, specially when considering the ship upgrades, as, from my experience, games are less decided by which type of goods you buy/sell, and more because of the fine tunning of the spaceship doing the job. You might want a fast Clipper, with a drive, in order to sail across the board in a blur of movement, trying to take all the highest demands before the others. Or you might want a slow and steady approach with a Freighter, carrying loads of goods to make fewer travels, but gaining time building (or using) spaceports to make several transactions at once. Or you might prefer the more balance Transport. Either way, though opportunity still plays its part, the ships is that most likely will make the players game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Straightforward mechanic, without several mini-games built in;
- Both strategic and tatical, with long-term decisions and the ability to see and use the best opportunities that appears along the way;
- The gameplay is smooth, almost relaxing, as once the board is fully opened, there is little surprises and no agression between players;
- Random set up makes the replay higher.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Long playing time: this isn't always a bad thing, but in a game in which players do the same thing over and over, I prefer a shorter playing time, as it can get dull fast;
- Luck of the dice: movement is made by rolling dice, and you might not be able to reach your intended destination, as fast as you wanted, because of them;
- Luck of the draw: the demand of the planets (which make goods more valuable) and passengers are drawn, randomly, from a bag. This can make a passenger just appear in the planet you are, or a demand appear in the planet you are going, making you gain more money just by pure luck;
- Low player interaction: though there is the possibility of trading between players, this will seldom happen, as if you have a good, you already have a destination for it (and you are probably in the way to there), so usually there is little reason to make trades. Other than this, the interaction is all indirect: someone delivers a good, fulfilling a demand, before you, or you use the spaceport built by someone else;
- Runaway leader: with little interaction, and no risk in sells, is possible that a player, with some luck, can pull away and open a big lead. There is little to be done, except hope for Lady Luck prefer you, or that mistakes are made.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like being in the easiest job done by Serenity. In Merchant of Venus there are no risks, except for a few unkown spots in the route, but even the nastier one (a cost 40 to pass) will only stop you, if you can't pay.

There is a lack of excitement in the gameplay. There are no high risk with high reward deliveries. No devious passenger that pays a lot, but might put you in trouble. No unstable good that can blow you ship, that cost cheap and sell for a lot in the right places. Though there is an asteroid field on the board, deliveries to or from there pay nothing more than other places.

Players do the same thing over and over and over again, with the full knowledge that they will deliverthe goods and be paid. This makes for a lackluster experience and helps in the runaway leader problem - if someone is leading, you might want to go all in and accept a highly dangerous delivery in a killer route - you might  fail, but, if you don't, you could turn the game around. No. The highest paying good might be right beside the consuming planet, connected by the smoothest of the routes.

Merchant of Venus is simply left in the finest dust by [thing=138161][/thing] , as, for me, is a much better game, with more options, more to do, more excitement and in about the same amount of time or less.

Still, Merchant of Venus offers a pure pick and delivery experience, is easy to teach and play to the point of being relaxing, just listen to the space radio while the spaceship, in autopilot, sails the in between the systems. Overall, the low confrontation and low complexity of Merchant of Venus can (and, for quite a while already, do) appeal to many players.

A bit long, but decent pickup-and-deliver game, where you have a choice of which systems to set up "quadrangle" trade routes and can try to jump in and interfere with other players' intended future trade hops.

We play the fast goods setup and home system variants from the General, plus a map patch, deeds count 1/2, all relics not in play start at base, and $3000 target.

I like a number of things about the game, but I don't love the game (although I am certainly willing to play it).  The movement is too random for my tastes - unfortunately you can't use averaging dice easily as it screws up the pilot die mechanism.  Buying ports and factories should be a less obvious decision, I think.  And, while I like the supply/demand mechanism in general I think it could stand a little tweaking.

I have seen this played at PrezCon several times.  I did not get much sense of what was hapenning from what I saw, so when it was suggested today, I didn't really know if I wanted to play.  Still, that was just a momentary reaction.  I am usually game for something new (to me at least).

The game itself is pretty much a pick-up and deliver game.  It could almost be a rail game, although some of the movement options like the nebula and jump points would be hard to explain.  There is also an exploration aspect, so when you start out, you don't know where things are.  As you deliver cargo, new chits are drawn.  Some of these are replacement cargo, but some of them are special high demand requests with a corresponding bonus price.  

The first part of the game is slower because you have to explore and check things out.  I picked up cargo without even knowing where it could go.  Fortunately, that worked out.  As the game progresses the pace increases because after exploration is over, you know what you need to do.  Still the game length is the biggest problem.  It is a good game, and I'll play a 7 game that's less than two hours anytime, but once a game gets over two hours, I am looking for an 8 or 9.  I am very glad I tried it, though.

RATING: 5
I can see why this is such a grail- it has a strong sense of narrative and exploration but it also has a pleasant economic-logistical system. Nonetheless it shows its age- the game is fiddly, overwrought and has too many banal decisions. Although the more recent Duck Dealer lacks the sense of exploration and chrome of MoV, it is in all meaningful ways to me a far superior game. In fairness, though, it is comparing apples and oranges (despite the obvious superficial ways in which DD is inspired by MoV).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I know this game gets a good reputation among veterans geeks, but to me, it's a bit too long and repetitive for my tastes.  The exploration bit is neat, and I like the way that the market in the game works, but it's a lot of doing the same thing over and over again, for a couple of hours on end.  And it can also be frustrating to be in a race for a particular action with another player, only to not be able to complete it because of a crummy roll.  Even good planning for that roll can be dashed due to the luck of the dice, and on top of that, the relics and other tiles about the board are randomly determined, too.  I'm not sure what the lasting appeal for this game is, other than nostalgia.

This is what I consider a nice average game for an economic game. There are some nice mechanics which get people to change their strategies mid-game, and it seems to push you out of your predictable trade routes in order to make more money, but in the end it just a get more money, but more stuff, to get more money, to buy more stuff, etc ad nauseum type of game. I think this would be a good example for High school kids and showing them how economies work if everyone is striving for maximum profit. Will always play, but would like to get people to try out the advanced rules...

One play on MirrorDude's very pretty home-made copy.  Initial impression:  Didn't grab me.  We were three newbs and a one with one game under his belt and we were playing more slowly than I think was necessary.  I'd be willing to give it another try if we could play more quickly.

It's a pick up and deliver game that seems to be mostly tactical.  I may like Duck Dealer better.

The rules are kind of a mess on this one but using 4-5 different sets and player aids we were able to get a 2-player learning game in about 3 hours. The Dathkadan remake is stunning and PNP Productions did a great job with putting it all together. A second play with 3-players went just over 2 hours.

Once the wheels got rolling, it was a very fun game. It does take a bit of getting used to but I think once someone has completed a game they should have a very good grasp on what to do. I can definitely see this going higher.

Our 3-player game went much faster, I'm guessing a combination of an extra explorer and 2/3 people knowing what to do. The board opens up a lot quicker than in a 2-player game.

You definitely need a good sorting system for this one as well...

Part exploration, part pick up and deliver.  Despite of my average rating, I actually enjoyed Merchant of Venus quite a bit.  Game starts off as a race to discover the 14 races littered throughout the board.  The incentive to be the first to reveal a new civilization is the I.O.U. discount that comes with it, allowing the player to obtain technology, goods, station or factory at a reduced price (with restrictions of course).  As the play progresses, the focus shifts to plotting a lucrative route so you can shuttle cargoes and passengers as efficiently as possible, since merchandises can only be obtained and sold at certain planets.

Although Merchant of Venus is able to combine the two aspects seamlessly, however, the game does show its age dramatically.  The biggest offender is the incredible amount of chits utilized, I would say to the point of headache-inducing, not to mention a pain to set up and to put away.  Then there is the roll and move mechanic.  Can't say I'm a fan of it at all.

A solid game, yet would not be one I'd play very often.  I do think this could benefit from a more modernized update.

While I do not like "train" games, I do enjoy Merchant of Venus. I think of it more as an exploration/trading game. For the first 10 to 15 moves you are trying to figure out where all of the cultures are. Once discovered you are trying to come up with the best trade route to get the best return from, with the "bonus" demands and fares thrown in to tempt you to go off route for a bit. Add in the jump gates which can make routes both more difficult and easier, it is much more than just a "train" game.

RATING: 7
4/29/14 - This game is charming as heck, but it's got two serious problems.  1) the clipper ship is way too good.  The winner of the game will have a clipper, guaranteed. 2) If you play the game without the optional combat rules (which I do), there is no way to catch the leader.  Once someone gets even a small lead, there is probably no reason to keep playing from a competitive standpoint.

I have conceived of some untried house rules to address these issues.  I'll try them some day to see if they help.  1) Change the clipper's movement from 4 dice to 3 dice +2.  2) Make space stations worth only $150 while retaining their $200 price tag.  

2-26-08:  After Magic Realm, I was sure this game was going to be pretty complex and difficult to play.  This was pretty much the opposite of my experience.  So far it looks very good, and, though I did rather poorly the first time through, I'm really looking forward to having at it once more.  3 player learning game lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes.

A decent space trading game. I'd like to play it again to form a more concrete opinion.

Update: After another play, this game seems deeply flawed. Bad rolls at the beginning can put you in a hole that you can never drag yourself out of, and the next several hours are painfully boring after that.

On the other hand, the painfully slow play was more the fault of a particular player than the game itself, so I should be somewhat forgiving.

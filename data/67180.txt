GAME: Tikal II: The Lost Temple
RANK: 1385
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The sequel to Tikal has you exploring a single temple in depth rather than an entire area of temples.  The art/box/components have a similar feel to them but gameplay is very different.

The game plays over 2 rounds, after which there is scoring.  On your turn, you have two major actions: 1) move your canoe and pick up a tile, which are all good and provide special benefits, and 2) move your explorer around the temple, and plant your flag in a room at the end of your turn.  A round ends when all of the special tiles are acquired (every player will get the same number of them, but they are all not necessarily equal in value).

Scoring consists of: 1) special scoring cards, 2) presence in temple rooms, 3) majority in treasure rooms, 4) possession of keys, 5) selling of artifacts, and 6) minor points acquired along the way, such as on some tiles.

This game scales very well from 2-4 players and is a solid design by the master team of Kramer and Kiesling.

Nothing like as interesting as Tikal, Java, Mexica, or even Torres. This is a fairly fun, simple game nonetheless. There are many strategic routes to take, but none of them are particularly entertaining. Nice production values though.

It's hard to explain my opinion on Tikal II. This game has many good elements: different strategies, great balance, the "outguessing", reasonable lenght, amazing components and awesome visual impact. I like the mechanic of picking one action around the track a lot: it's simple, smart and unique. All this things combined makes this game quite elegant.

Yet I don't particularly enjoy it and I cannot even say why. I did a lot of researches before my purchase (I read reviews and comments, I watched videos, and so on) and it seemed to me like I would have enjoyed this game a lot... and it still does when I think about it. Sad truth is: I think that Tikal II is just a bit more than ok.

This was a genuinely fun game.  I was a bit surprised by how much I like it (not surprised that I liked it, but how much).  The game mechanics are appealing and fit together nicely, and the game allows multiple paths to victory.  The rule book, while flashy and well-worded, failed to address some minor intricacies.  For example, you can't move more than 5 "places" around the river during a turn, but what exactly counts as a place?  That said, you can fill in the gaps fairly easily, and Tikal II provides a robust and satisfactory experience.

I didn't like the original Tikal. It had a very cool theme, but the gameplay was dry, formulaic and the most AP prone I had ever seen. I ignored this one for quite a while, until I read it was nothing like the first one.

So I gave it a try, and guess what? It's true: it's nothing like the first one. Unfortunately, the AP is still there. This is a game where "depth" comes not from some serious consequences of your decisions, but from a massive amount of possibilities. I've never liked such games... give me a handful of choices to make an agonizing decision over this nonsense anytime.

I'm not willing to put this one in the "won't pkay again" bin just yet, but it might very well end up there. For now, it's a solid 4 for me.

Igazán egy kellemes esseni darab.
Megjelenésében és mechanizmusában - szerencsére - teljesen más, mint az első rész. Nem igazán szeretem az akciópont elköltés mechanizmust. Lassúnak, körülményesnek találom és sokat kell várni amíg újra sorra kerülsz, miközben teljesen átalakul a játéktér. Na, itt erről szerencsére nincs szó!
Ötletes az akciólapkák megszerzésének módja (kenuzás a folyón), melyek tárgyakat, előnyöket, pontszerzési lehetőségeket biztosítanak a játékosok számára.
A köröd második felében az inkatemplom felderítésére indulhatsz - pontvadászatra - miközben a játék előre haladtával egyre több terem tárul fel.
Természetesen aki a játék félidejében és annak végén összességében a legtöbb pontot gyűjtötte, felvételizhet az Indiana Jones képzőbe.

- Tetszett, hogy félidőben megfordul a játékossorrend; van benne többségi rész; mindig az adott helyzethez alkalmazkodva több lehetőség közül is választhatsz; a megszerzett kincsek beváltásának ritmusa van; bár összetett, de talán a  kezdőknek is "eladható", stb.
- Nem tetszett, hogy az optimális lehetőség kiválasztása miatt az AP mértéke elég jelentős. (van mit számolgatni)

Összességében kellemes szórakozást nyújtott a vele töltött mintegy szűk két óra. Szívesen játszanék vele újra... (7)

Good exploration game with multiple paths for victory points.  Nothing is really surprising, but everything works fine.  As exploration advances, doors allow you to enter rooms, for which you need coloured keys.  But keys also have other uses.  You can also get treasures and sell them, explore through secret passagges...
Edition is really good, with an incredible insert for the game.

Plastic miniatures in a typical area-control eurogame isn’t something you’re used to see often: and even though Tikal II’s are quite cheap they still help make the game much more attractive than it deserves.

As far as the game goes though, Tikal II blindly follows the golden rule of any eurogame: be content with anything half-satisfying you can get. As there’s no direct conflict nor real messing with the other players, it’s just another boring multiplayer solitaire with an awesome point salad appeal, the finest in euro fashion.

In some ways, naming this game Tikal II does it injustice as it creates a certain expectation about this game.  The game has some similarities in theme, exploring a temple, but the gameplay is very different.  So if you're expecting Tikal, this isn't it.  But there is a lot to it, many decisions are required to play well.

There is a lot more than meets the eye. I thought it would be a light game, but there is a lot going on. Tons of planning. Multitude upon multitude of scoring possibilities.

Playing from seat position seems critical in both halves of the game.

Other than name and theme, there is little resemblance to the original Tikal. 

The game is highly thematic, conveying the sense of exploration very well.

...and Ooooo...that insert...

I'm of two minds on this one.  First, the components are very nicely done and the artwork is good.  It is well produced and a quality product.

Unfortunately, the game itself is rather uninspired.   The decisions on each turn come down to some form of  "do I score 7 points by doing action A, or score 8 points by doing action B, or score 5 points now, but increase the chances of scoring 10 points later?".  

The other part that bothers me is the idea that all players can pretty much explore wherever, so there's really no tension when it comes to blocking or preventing other players.

So this is clearly a "family" style game, but is just complicated and piece-filled enough to be inappropriate for most families.

Initial rating a 6.   I acquired this one on the cheap not expecting it to be very good, and it about met my expectations.  Will put it up for opportunistic trade.

While the title is just there to sell the game, and the game really has nothing to do with the original Tikal outside of maybe the theme, they managed to make a pretty decent game here.

Players are explorers running around the inside of a temple attempting to score points for various things.  On your turn, you take an action based on a huge ring of actions.  You can essentially take whichever action chip you want, but you periodically have to pay based on how far around the ring you've traveled, so moving slowly around the ring is generally better, unless you really need to spring for a valuable action.  With the actions, players can do things such as drawing artifacts which will score points, getting keys which will allow their explorer to travel around the temple to score points, find secret passageways to super secret point scoring rooms, etc.

With a bunch of ways to score points, it seems like there is quite a bit of room for various strategies, so I'm interested to check it out some more!  As is typical for Asmodee Games, the game has some great production values as well, which I must say helps the game out as well.

RATING: 3
Tikal II is basically non-auction Tikal with all of the things I find interesting about the original title stripped out, reducing it to a bland, and rather boring exploration game that has almost none of the tension that makes Tikal I such a great game.

As in Tikal you explore a board that you make by placing hexagons, can collect items that score in a 1/3/6/10/15 progression, dig for random treasures, and ostensibly compete with the other players in claiming sites.

Unlike Tikal there are secondary ways to claim tiles, and the secondary scoring is actually more important than the primary for much of the game. It also has no auction, and there are no action points, instead allowing players to free roam and claim one room as long as they have the keys which govern movement from tile to tile (which is sort of like the steel steps in Tikal I).

The thing that makes this game dull is the primary scoring mechanism. Most of the points come from placing a flag and scoring points based on the number of doors in the room (1-2) and then also points equal to the number of other doors of that colour that you've already claimed. The first person to do this in any given room gets an extra point or two, but the cascading door bonus scores are where the real action is, and those can't be blocked.

The other places that could offer races, which actually have finite spots, also have close to comparable secondary spaces. (i.e.: the final square offers 16/14/12/10, the spread matters here, but in most of the squares it is just a 1-2 bonus for first versus anyone else who wants to go there).

The door scoring mechanic also encourage specialization in one or two colours for each players, which made it feel like more of a basic optimization game.

I really, really like Tikal I, but everything I find fascinating about that game is missing here. Dull.

RATING: 5
(Played at Spiel 2010.) Tikal is one of my favourite games, and when news reached me that the Dynamic Duo was working on a new Tikal, I knew without a shade of doubt that this was one title I had to try. Not because I thought the result would be as good as or better than the ‘original’: I've learned the hard way that such hopes are alltogether too easily dashed. No, simply out of a large interest to see what the authors would come up with after a decade's worth of working on other titles.

The game itself borrows some elements from Tikal (treasures, hexagonal tiles, obstructions to moving about), but uses them in such a different way that Tikal II very clearly stands on its own. That is definitely a Good Thing. Mechanics-wise, Tikal II is also very much its own game. Gone is the gameplay which had the players think their way out of a competitive situation in a creative fashion; now a much more diverse point-grabbing engine has taken residence in the cardboard and chits. The AP system is also gone: the players now traverse a ‘river’ with tiny boats to collect a single action tile giving them, amongst other things, keys/amulets, knowledge of hidden passageways, or simply the ability to discover a new room in the pyramid. After having moved the boat an explorer can walk for as long as he wants in search of yet unstudied rooms, leaving tiny flags of ownership in the process. These flags give him points as the game progresses. There is lots more to do, but I'm not going to rehash the rules in this comment.

All in all Tikal II is, like I said, very much its own game. Unfortunately it is not a game I find very enjoyable. Basically every turn is a turn spent on tactical point grabs. I'm not saying those come easy as there are quite a number of interdependencies to resolve, but there is very little long(er) term-planning involved. In addition, much of the player interaction has become the indirect kind: taking away options from other players instead of directly interfering with a board position. Tikal II is clearly the child of the modern game design era: presenting tons of scoring options to give players the semblance of choice, but in reality the choices, once mastered, do not add actual tension to the proceedings. In my opinion a good game is one where players must then use the basic actions to string together pieces of masterful tactical and strategical wizardry, and I think Tikal II will not ever offer that.

In my opinion Tikal remains by far the better game, but I concede that people who like ‘doing stuff’ and enjoy having lots of options without too much difficult game patterns, will prefer Tikal II. This is not a game I need to own, or will actively seek out, but I will join in a game if people are bent on playing it.

Bought this new, likely for about $45, hoping to find it plays just like Tikal.  I have a much lower opinion of this game than Tikal, but I really shouldn't.  There is so much in this game to like: Fantastic board, game components, artwork, and box insert.  An incredible comic book style introduction to the game and rule book - actually 3 separate such rule books in 3 different languages!  A card sleeve for the cards.  Unique rules.  Easy to learn, lots of replay, lots of different ways to score.  No experience with Tikal is required.  2-4 players.
It is published by Game Works.  I don't believe I own any other games from them, or even know of any.
But it's not the same as Tikal.  That's really the only thing I can criticize about it. (Before I started describing this game, my rating for it was 8.  Then 9.  Now 9.5.  That's as high as I will let it go though.)
I just now noticed the "mask" on the front of the box.  Awesome.  Okay, it's a 10.  But its gameplay doesn't come close to Tikal's.

Players are explorers uncovering a Mayan temple.  Players on their turn advance their canoe around the outside of the gameboard, possibly selling treasure along the way, and claiming an action tile.  Action tiles do various things, such as extending the temple complex via adding a hex, finding secret keys for unlocking the complex, discovering treasure and secret passages, acquiring special cards, and so on.  After moving the canoe, the players then explore the temple complex, placing a camp piece and scoring points based on location and previous like discoveries.  The game is played in two halves, with a scoring mid-way through the game.  A lot of stuff in here, and it all works well.  It is well produced, and offers a nice blend of tactical point scoring play and long term strategic end game planning.  The problem is it's a pure Euro, and one of literally hundreds in the last two or three years that all seem to do the same thing - and will thus get lost in the crowd.  Happy to play, but there are probably 20 games that do the same thing but better.

RATING: 8
The rules were a bit fiddly and there was some AP during the first play, but I really enjoyed this. The different scoring options allow you to focus on a different strategy than your opponent. So far it seems this is one advantage over the previous Tikal (where treasures are very important), but I'd like to play it a lot more to see if one of the different scoring options proves itself to be more important. The one downside I can see so far, compared to another of Kramer's new games, Asara, is that the rules in this one are a little bit harder to teach and the scoring options less obvious than Asara, so it might be less ideal for casual gamers, but I'm not sure if it has the depth to satisfy more serious gamers.

Tikal II seems like a game that was designed to reduce Tikal's flaws versus a game designed to augment Tikal's strengths. The luck of the tile draw is reduced through draw 3 keep 1 mechanics. Mean player interaction has been minimized and the AP problem is reduced but not eliminated. The movement through specific spaces on hexes and theme are still here. If you're looking for an exact remake of Tikal, I'd tell you it's another game, not a movie sequel.

A geekbud described it as a “sad little game”, and I know exactly what he means by that. I was sadly disappointed in this game. Maybe if they hadn’t used the Tikal brand, I would’ve approached the game with a different set of expectations, but they did, and this game is not in the same universe as Tikal let alone the same jungle. I felt like this game was the anti-Tikal. Like they said, "Oh, you think Tikal has too much AP and takes too long with 10 action points each turn? OK, we'll make a game that's the opposite of that then!" I mean, it's just too easy to do everything you want to do. Once you have a key of every color (which isn't that hard to do as your damn boat can travel literally around the board) then you can go wherever you want in the temple. So each turn is, "I go here for 5 points. Your turn. I go here for 6 points. Your turn. Etc." It’s a point-grabbing exercise where people bound ahead of each other turn after easy turn.

We all just went to the rooms we hadn't each explored yet and got our obligatory points. After all that going 'round, I pulled out two bonus cards for 15 points for the win. I kinda felt bad in the last few turns knowing I was sitting on 15 points and watching the other players make their moves. It didn't matter much what they did and I knew it.

They really missed an opportunity here. Imagine a game of exploring a temple with the requisite glyphs (keys) and secret passages where each turn you need to plan your moves carefully as you risk getting closed in (Grab your hat, Indy!!) or not being able to get that treasure that is one tile away because it was just stolen by Belosh (Belock… Belock…). That’s the game I wanted to play, not this tensionless, point grabbing stroll in the temple.

Fun temple exploration/adventuring game.  Might like this even better than Tikal 1.  Gameplay doesn't have a lot in common with the original other than the theme and the hex board that gets created as the game progresses.  Obviously this game has benefited from several years of experience and many iterations on the worker placement/action selection mechanics first introduced in Tikal 1.

Wow, what a great production. Box, materials, rulebook and even the vacuum tray are really top-notch.
Though there are many superficial similarities to the great Tikal (the main reason why I bought this part 2 blindlessly), the game is played rather different. Though the main actions are quite simple to be done, the board -full with tiles and flags- quickly becomes hard to oversee, thus making decisions during play harder to make. Having to make many choices (1 of four action tiles, 1 of 3 temple tiles, 1 of 3 action cards etc) gives considerate action paralysis for a game of such lightness.
On the other hand, I find that theme and gameplay are much more and better tied together in this game than in its predecessor, a big plus.
Rating may go up after more plays.

My initial impression is very very positive. This is a fine game in the tradition of the Mask series, though without the action point mechanic; but the development of the game is absolutely superb. The box insert is a work of art, the rules are flawless, the art is outstanding and functional, the components are exactly right, and you get a comic as well. This game is a credit to the designers and the production company.

Not much to compare to the original other than name. Does that make Tikal II a bad game, since it's predecessor was a classic? Well I'm not sure.  First impressions left me with a blah feeling, as the progression of the game felt rather stagnant and mechanical.  The points seemed to flow at a very even pace among all players, and all seemed almost over balanced.  The end game separated a victor from the pack largely because it was a first game and one player had the fortune of drawing the right card.  

However, I have thought a lot about the title since then.  Which is good.  And I wonder if there are paths to victory which are more succinct, and the strategies more complex.  

Until I play again though I still feel my first impression is more correct, but my mind is open.

Bought this game in thinking of my favorite Tikal 1999.
Not the same game and mechanics.
Have to play 4 players to have fun and complexity.
No good at 2 players.

I just had to have this game. I love Tikal, I love archaeology, and as a Douglas Adams fan "the fourth game in the Mask trilogy" was an irresistible concept. As I feared but expected, it lacks most of the charm of the original. Theme and gameplay are much less connected, and the artwork is far less evocative. Still, I might possibly play it someday.

A very pleasant game, rather fast to play. Easy rules, good thematic, playable by noobs but also by some a little more stategical gamers. I don't have played the first version of Tikal, but this one seems to have a better design. A minus is the poor quality of the plastic miniatures, and also the lack of choice in the actions that some players can find this game too linear.

Very little in common with Tikal and the rest of the Mask series. This is far more approachable for less experienced gamers yet has good subtle depth for more experienced gamers.

This is a nice review that I very much agree with:

Another excellent game from Kramer & Kiesling. Except for the theme and the laying of hexagonal tiles on the board, it doesn't really resemble the original "Tikal", which is a good thing. In fact, although there isn't any strikingly novel mechanic, the game doesn't feel much like any other game I know. Expectedly, it's a very solid design, with interesting and agonizing decisions, and just the right balance between strategy and randomness. On the production side, I like it that they chose to go with plastic miniatures, and especially that the explorers are different for each player.

RATING: 6.5
I finally got to play this one and even though it has nothing to do with Tikal, knowing it's meant to explore the temples that you dig out before, sucks you in.

It's a fun game with some cool ideas, but getting points for pretty much everything really nags on me! If the different ways would feel different instead of just another route to points, it would be much better.

Ah well, can't have everything I guess... still a good game, though, just not a great one.

Nothing at all to do with Tikal except in sharing a theme, so the title's pretty exploitative. This is very much a point salad, everything you do scores points, it's just a case of maximising on each turn with little thought for the future. I really can't see anything by way of 'strategy' here. The scoring is tight, so little things like leaving the next player a good opportunity can decide the result.

Tikal II is a game that I always look forward to playing and that I have found welcomes non-seasoned players with intuitive rules, clear use of symbols, and ultimately very fluid, balanced gameplay.  There are many different ways to navigate the board, to score, and to employ strategies versus your opponents, offering plenty of dimension for repeated play.  Furthermore, Vincent Dutrait's stunning artwork throughout the board, game pieces, box design, etc makes for a very immersive Mayan world, full of both peril and discovery with all its skeletons, artifacts, keys, creatures, and more.  Tikal II also features well crafted components (including detailed player pawns, pirogues, flags, supply chests), a game box with pre-built storage (always handy), instructions with a clean layout that makes it easy to run through topics, a comic book intro to the game narrative and characters... I mean, at every turn this game is loaded with artistry, design, imagination, storytelling... everything you want in a game and everything you'd be glad to pay for.  In my opinion, Tikal II is a vastly underrated game.  And I say this as someone who has never had a chance to play the original Tikal, just someone who has explored Tikal II as a game experience unto itself.  Other players have criticized it for being flat and with limited ability to use strategy and thinking to separate yourself from other players on the scoring track.  However, I've always seen this as an asset in keeping all players invested in the outcome of the game and never feeling lost in the mix.  If anything, this is a game that is fit for expansions to continue the narrative, to introduce new characters or traits, to reveal more mysterious tasks to complete, ways to sabotage others, to unearth more valuable items, to build out more chambers to explore... there are so many good directions that could enhance the game. I'm hoping that Designers Kiesling and Kramer get the opportunity to go further with this 2nd iteration of the Tikal series, especially considering there are so many ho-hum expansions on the market for games that offer far less to begin with.  Definite recommend.

Beautiful graphics and excellent components , but the gameplay a bit flat within just pushing up the scoring counter in a few ways that all paths are too close in ranking and jus some luck of drawing card or treasure tokens make the win lose diff. Two phases for each turn, But every thing comes together makes the long downtime , result in little diff in points among players. Not a satisfying game because all points are public to all players. What players enjoying is just waiting the optimized move of others. So no excitement in this exploring game. Disappointed.

Tikal was one of the first boardgames I ever played, IMO is a masterpiece, so I had a very high expectation from Tikal II…. and I was crushingly disappointed. Tikal II is nothing like its predecessor, only the theme is somewhat connected :(.

While Tikal is a hard, meaty game, Tikal II is very light in comparison, so perhaps is a better game to introduce new gamers to our hobby. It plays for a long time for such a light game. Still I recognize it has its moments. It has some tactical hard choices to make from time to time, but it also has a lot of obvious choices and worst of all, it has no tension whatsoever and a good measure of uncontrollable luck. 

On the good side, the insert is amazing, as well as the art and components.  I (maybe) will play it again, but I won’t buy I or request it. It´s just not as interesting as Tikal.

Not to add to the dog pile, but this game shouldn't be called Tikal, as it has very,very little in common with its predecessor.

First point - one of the greatest box inserts I've ever seen.  Probably second in visual appeal to Andromeda, but probably first in practicality.

I'm not a big Tikal fan in the first place, but I'm not a detractor either.  So the pedigree of the game is neither a draw nor a hindrance.

My main problem with the game is that it is too complicated for most and too tactical for more hardcore game players.  That and the game seems to last too long for what it is.  If played very quickly I think my opinion might change.  Our first game took us over 1.5 hours, but as a 45 minute game I would certainly be tempted to revise my rating.

RATING: 8
Actually, I was expecting more searching of treasure, however the aim of the game is scoring points. There is no necessity to search for treasure, however treasure also may be exchanged to points. Nevertheless, the game is quite interesting: new tiles are revealed in the temple, by exploring those tiles you score points. Points can also be scored through actions which are placed on the bank of the river, which flows around the temple... This game is different enough from our other games. I think it will be played.

Žaidimas, iš kurio tikėjausi daugiau lobių ieškojimo, o pasirodo čia greičiau reikia rinkti taškus. Lobius rinkti nėra būtina, nors juos į taškus taip pat iškeisti galima. Kita vertus, žaidimas pakankamai įdomus: šventykloje vis atverčiami nauji langeliai, kuriuos ištyrinėjus gaunama taškų. Taip pat taškai renkami per veiksmus, kurie išsidėstę palei upę tekančią aplink šventyklą... Žodžiu šis žaidimas pakankamai skiriasi nuo kitų mūsų kolekcijoje. Manau bus žaidžiamas.

Nagyon jó kis játék ez, még ha a Tikalt nem is közelíti meg. A Tikalban nagyon élveztem a teljes szabadságot. A 10 akciópontomat arra és olyan sorrendben költhettem el, ahogyan akartam. Itt is van némi szabadság a mozgások során, mert akárhány lépés megtehető, ha van nálunk megfelelő kulcs. Az is tetszett, hogy teljesen más stratégiával is hasonlóan eredményes tud lenni az ember. A pontszámítás sok főnél egy kicsit talán macerásabb, de elég egyszerű, gördülékeny játékról van szó.
A műanyag bábuk, zászlók picit gagyinak tűnnek, és a lapkák is vékonyak, de azért rossz minőségűnek nem mondanám. Az insert viszont első osztályú, minden játékba ilyen kellene. Bár így eléggé helyigényes, nagy a doboz. Mindent összevetve nagyon kellemes, a közepesnél kicsit könnyebb játék a Tikal II.

RATING: N/A
Tikal II: The Lost Temple is a sequel to 1999 Spiel des Jahres winner Tikal, from world-famous duo Kramer-Kiesling.

Actions points have given way to two actions per turn :
 1) move part of your expedition around the board to choose an action tile, and then
 2) move your head scientist within the temple to explore new rooms and find gold.

There are many ways to score. Collecting and delivering treasures is one, and having the majority in some rooms or exploring the main temple as well as an outer secret chamber, are others.

Tikal II calls for careful planning, as your scientist can't move freely within the temple without specific items, and tension, as the actions around the board grow scarce. A game consists of two rounds, each concluded by a scoring. In the end, the player with the most gold is declared winner.

A bit more rules for a game that is shallower than Tikal - so Tikal is obviously superior to this game. Still it's quite good and harmless, although a lot more tactical than strategic.

I definitely enjoyed this more than it's predessor of the same title.  I thought original Tikal had a lot of analysis paralysis for me since it's an Action Point efficiency system.  Tikal II however does not have Action Pts at all, and I thought that it included some really nice layers and additional touches with boat movement that influenced your draft choices for (1) action tiles, (2) treasure scoring and (3) paying toll.  Then, there are the explorations within the temple and also choosing to keep keys for: (a) room searches versus (b) accumulation for final scoring. There is some good planning and timing choices that are important based upon player interactions. I definitely view this as a more enjoyable and fun spin on the original game.  There is very little resemblance to the original game so this could have had a different name or title (it would not matter).

I worked my way though most of Stefan Feld’s game library last year, so this year I’m exploring Kramer & Kiesling’s catalog. I have yet to play Tikal, but Tikal II was an enjoyable Indiana Jones style exploration game. Good for when you’re in the mood for a light Euro. Clever use of the entire game board: central exploration of ruins, then perimeter score track, and then boats sailing around the game border to collect action tiles.

Yet another mistake in naming/branding a game with a previous one by the same designer.

FF made this mistake, and while I think the game he made was fine, it's just not related very closely to it's predecessor. 

K & K have done the same here and made a game that's only marginally related.

No action points. No worker placement. No area majority.

The similarity lies in the traversing of boundaries. In Tikal it was an action point cost.  You could make the cost more prohibitive in the orientation of the hexes when you place them. In T2 it's about set collection to allow yourself to cross the boundaries. You can still orient tiles to make them more prohibitive but only slightly so.

So what we end up with is a much more tactical game that falls into the light-medium area of gaming. There is still the min-maxing but in much simpler form. On the up side the AP is really kept to a minimum and the game plays much faster overall.

I think that group-think has grabbed most of the early adopters and players who, like with Factory Manager before it, were lead to the wrong assumption about T2's game play. There's a quality game here that I'm willing to play again; indeed much more than games like Stone Age, Kingsburg, or even Fresco. 

This is obviously meant to bring a mere slice of the flavor that was Tikal while delivering something else altogether  different. There's really not much out there like it either IMHO. 

One thing is for sure, and sadly has been for a while: one of my favorite designers, Wolfgang Kramer, is just not designing game for the more hardcore crowd any more. Like Knizia before him, the stuff that made him legend is not only his legacy, but the games we should turn to rather than anything newer released by him.

The game mechanics is totally different from Tikal. This one doesn't employ my least favorite action-point mechanic so the game progresses relatively faster.

This went from an 8 about 1/4 of the way through, to its final 6 at the end. I love that it feels like Tikal while being completely different in the gameplay department. It's MUCH lighter, but still fun. The problem is that it was too easy to get around and do whatever you wanted. This may have been a result of our play style, so I'd like to try it again. The secret passage scoring also seemed excessive.

Light and relatively fast game, unlike its predecessor. The only real similarity I can find between the two is that hexes are placed in a way to possibly block access to them for opponents.

First impression (4 players): One of those games where there is nothing really broken or failed but feels soulless and overbalanced. Almost whatever you do you get same number of points and options you have during play don't feel to do that much because of this.

RATING: 8
Good game that goes a long way in fixing some of the problems of the first most notably the AP issue.  Exploring an ancient temple is cool and this game has some of that aspect to it.  There are a finite amount of actions and adapting to an ever changing situation is key here.  Do not expect to have a strategy that won't get derailed.  The score is an aggregate from the family ranging from seven (me) to nine (wife).  I think that the game is very tightly balanced and with experienced players, the score will be close, with no runaway winner.

Several different mechanics at work here: player turns determined by a rondel system, area majority for points, and resource management as hurdles. Harmless and enjoyable enough, but also pointless and never manages to really take advantage of the adventurer/jungle theme. Plus, I really hate the look of the components: everything about them says "cheap-plastic-shit-that-stab-your-feet." Perfectly fine game. Can't wait to get it out of my sight.

One of those pick up lots of points along the way with each turn, in lots of different possible ways, and hope you can find a way that's more efficient than the other players. Different tiles allow you to pick up different stuff and they're scattered around 6 locations around the outside of the board and basically you land on one with your boat and execute it - the further you jump around the board the more costly it is so the first decision is whether travelling long distances to get the tile you want is worth it. The tiles not only allow you to pick up stuff, but also allow you to add an exploration tile into the middle of the board, because in the second part of your turn, you move your explorer around the centre of the board to plant your flag on an exploration tile and score its points (plus more points for each exploration tile of the same colour that you're already on!). As the game progresses, the more flags you have out there, the more points you score, so everything ratchets up. Once the tiles are gone from around the outside, lay them all out randomly, reverse player order and play the game a second time. Which seems odd, turning a 45 minute game into a 90 minute game just for the hell of it. But there you go. Components are wonderful, artwork is great, the system is clean and enjoyable. If you don't mind incremental points game, this will work for you.

I can see the complaints for this game as valid now, but I still enjoy this game a lot. It's very hard to get ahead in this game, and it will almost always come down to the last points to see who's won. 

I really love the theme. The insert to this game is a god send. Overall, it's a great starter for playing during a day of gaming, or a great gateway game. This will come out of the game closet for play maybe twice a month.

RATING: 6.5
Adventure-Exploring game, where you have many options to score points: explore rooms, find and sell treasures, score with keys in your camp, find secret rooms... The game initially leaves you with a bland taste, as there's no action point allowance system; all movements are free, provided you have the keys to move. There's thus no "optimal" strategy, but you have to adapt to the game, as it progresses. I really like the route building mechanism, where you want to optimize your movements with the least possible number of keys. Very nice game and theme that does its job well.

In this game you start your turn moving your boat round the board like a giant roundel and take an action tile. Once that resolves, you can move your meeple through the temple and collect points based on where you end your movement and place your flag. The game has a number of interesting strategies, as you need keys to walk through doors, but you can also chose to bank those keys so they score for you twice per game. There are treasure tiles you can try to collect or sell, or you can try to pile on getting flags in all the rooms of the same color for big points. The game walks the line of trying to carve out your own scoring niche while keeping a close eye on what other players are going for and stopping them where you can.

Part maze (exploring room tiles that you need keys to enter) and part resource collection (collect keys and treasures).

The more you explore rooms of a certain color the more those are worth (set collection of rooms). Set collection of keys and temples effects end game scoring.

Love the theme, very good components although the little boats are too small. The insert is the best ever! Game play is fun but fairly light. Lots of choices and strategy throughout the game and multiple paths to victory. Gets tense towards the end when the treasure room is about to be placed.  You better be sure you have the correct keys to get to it!  Very good game over all, plays well with two.

It's so weird that this was named Tikal II. Other than the general theme of exploring ziggurats for treasure, there's nothing in this that's like the first Tikal.

It was really good. There are a lot of things to think about each turn, some hard decisions to make, and numerous ways to score points. But it all seems to fit together nicely.

Also: Tikal II > Tikal

Enjoy this even more than Tikal, as I think that the turns and options are a little more streamlined. I like the colors of the keys and how the action track around the edge of the board can be costly for what options to take. It is definitely a cool exploration game with a nice action selection mechanism.

RATING: 6.3
Yes, it's about a temple in the jungle. Yes, there are treasures. Yes, the map (board) is filled in as you play the game. And there are stone steps connecting the hexes to one another. But I think it's about as related to [thing=54][/thing] as [thing=44163][/thing] is to [thing=2651][/thing]! Well, perhaps a little more than that!

There are 2 halves, with play order reversing direction in the second half. Each half starts by laying out a number of tiles divided along several (8?) stops around the edge of the board. Players move their canoe forward up to 5 stops, claim a tile, then move their explorer on the board. Tiles might give you keys (in various colors; needed to use the similarly colored stepping stones), allow you to place a tile onto the board (draw 3, pick one; other 2 go on bottom of stack), collect a secret door token (to go to an adjacent, unconnected hex, or to go to several high-reward locations on the board), collect a treasure (several piles are set up; draw 3, keep 1 from a pile), etc. Between 2 pairs of stops, you can sell a group of treasures of the same type: sale is at current price, then price dial is rotated one step to change prices of all treasure types. After dealing with the chosen tile, you typically move your explorer, place a flag, and earn some VP. At the end of each half, you also earn VP based on how you have placed your flags and saved key colors matching flags on certain colored temple spaces. 

The game plays pretty smoothly. But gone are the action points, and the area control, and the tension of its predecessor. Every turn players are grabbing a few VP, very incrementally moving ahead (in a way that others can usually match). But the way scoring flags works, I think people will mostly end up scoring very similarly (place flags in rooms of the same color to maximize VP scoring with each flag, so each player will likely focus on a color or two). Tikal just felt SO much more competitive!

I suppose a comparison to Tikal is unavoidable.  Personally I found it a little more playable than Tikal, now that the "action points" morass has been done away with, and there's not so much mystery about which is the best position for a new tile.  The little sell-your-artifacts wheel didn't get used much in the first half and we were wondering if it wasn't maybe one gadget too many, but then in the second half it got a lot of play, so maybe they knew what they were doing after all!  I'd play it again.

Sorry, but not even close to Tikal in terms of quality of game. In fact, this is the soulless cousin. The flaws from Tikal are magnified and they didn't fix things like the fact that once you fall behind, there is no recovering. The fact that the game just isn't very interesting compounds it.

A reasonable sequel, Tikal II zooms into a single temple from Tikal to evoke a similar hex-exploration experience.  The authors traded Tikal's brain-burning elegance for a diverse set of actions, mountains of beautiful bits, and too many scoring options.  The result is less cutthroat but this is oddly more difficult to teach and less satisfying to boot.

Tikal was a great game and Tikal II will not disappoint you. The two games are very different from each other (the theme is the same). Wonderful components. Simple but intricate rules. In your first game, you are hooked in the theme and game mechanics. A couple of games later, you realize that there is some deep strategies that go on here. If you like family games, this is a game for you. If you like heavy games like Le Havre, Goa, and such, this game will not disappoint you. There is a lot going on underneath the surface in this game. It is not easy to find another game that will work well with both groups. I am not in favor of sequels, but this one is equally great as the original Tikal.

I've taught and played this a few times. Whereas it may not be Tikal, nobody ever said it was. It definitely has a theme connection, and a few mechanical hints to the Mask games.

A beautiful looking game that plays much more casual than its predecessor. It offers less turn angst, but adds more atmosphere, and the action selection mechanism (instead of action point allocation) works great. I do not know how the gameplay will hold up over time, but for now, me and my girlfriend like it more than the original Tikal. It has been suggested that Tikal II is more random than the first game, but Tikal I was not without randomness (treasure tiles, drawing the volcano tile) either. Glad to own this beautiful looking game.
UPDATE: As a four player game, this is a solid 8 for me. Turn angst and difficult decisions (for a family game) all the way. As a two player game I would rate it a 7.

Simple game, take a tile that gives you a needed item such as keys to enter rooms, treasures to sell, or cards for special abilities. Add a room to the board if needed, and move your explorer to a room of a colour that scores you points, because you've been in that colour room before. Easy to grasp and understand right away, which was a plus. I really liked the key system, there were 5 different colours and you can't enter a room unless you have that colour key. So it was fun to try and lay out tiles in areas that only you could access at that moment because only you had a purple key. Not much in common with Tikal at all, other than the box photo and the fact they use hexes.

Tikal was discovered and explored during a very successful expedition led by Profs. Kramer and Kiesling. A decade later, a scroll is found, that hints of a lost temple near the first site. This rumor rekindles their passion for Tikal and the two scientists start to discuss the prospect of another expedition to Central America. In the midst of their planning they encounter Profs. Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumor.
\13\\13\
Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire, after a fine meal, finished off with Cuban cigars, and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues. To a man they clamor their unanimous assent and it is decided to join forces and go back to Tikal. Appointments are made, patrons are found, equipment is assembled, notes are compared, and then they are off.
\13\\13\
An uneventful journey takes them to Guatemala, and then on to the old site. Not too long after, they discover that there is indeed an undisturbed temple, in an adjacent valley. As it belonged to a long-forgotten king, the temple promises many surprises and much, much gold. And so the adventure begins...

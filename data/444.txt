Fun family game, stitch up your fellow players by moving further than necessary to cut them off from escape.  Then everything resets and you go again.  Rolling unluckily on the dice, especially at exactly the wrong time can be a real pain and source of fun for others.  You will hear the chant 'ghost, ghost ghost . . .' as you prepare to roll to stay just ahead of Hugo and slip into a room.

[Children's Game]
A very nice roll and move type game that plays very well over the entire range of players. Very simple to explain and quick to play, it's a game that young kids can handle (4-5 yrs old) but that older kids and adults will not get completely bored with. This game also gives me a little window into the future of my daughter's lives. Anyone seeking to court my girls had better watch out is all I can say! My daughters love to make sure that their 'man' figures are the ones that Hugo catches while their 'girl' figures are fleeing to safety. When Hugo is close enough and the ghost face on the die shows up I rarely hear the expected 'awwwwwwwghhh'. It's always "oppps, wait, [switch], there" as another man meets his doom at the hands of my daughters!

Christmas present for my 4 and a half years old daughter.

I spent a lot of time looking for a good game for her age and surprisingly I picked this over other games although at first is less suitable for her age than many others as Spinderella, Spooky Stairs, The Enchanted Tower , etc.

The "Ghost Game", as she calls it, is a great game for even 4 years old kids despite in the box says "7+". [b]It has been a blast[/b] not only for her but for the whole family. By now we play as a one round game with the classic rules but slowly we'll introducing the three rounds per game and the backside board with the revised rules.

Totally recommended for children playing with adults as long as everybody have fun.

RATING: 7
Great game for nongamers! Roll and move but you can't take it seriously (and their is enough decision making to keep it interesting) Mostly just goofy fun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Light, but good game that adults and kids can enjoy together.  Obviously, it's a dicefest... and feels like musical chairs... but it's all about calculated risks.  ** Update: luck predominates with 6-8 players, but the ghost emerges quickly and it's a good romp. **
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one is great with the whole family.  There's some decent angst as your partygoers are tracked down by Hugo.  My three year old gets pretty excited when being chased.  We have to help him with the strategy.

Simple game mechanic as players try to run from the ghost.  My five-year-old loves to play and the theme is a huge hit with he - he enjoys the idea of running from a ghost.  He can play it without any problems and I enjoy it with him.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You can't play this seriously.  It has to be played in a relaxed, whatever happens attitude.  There are too many ghost moves between turns to treat it as a serious game (played with 5).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game for older kids.  Try to hide from the ghost or he sends you to the cellar.  Good strategy and math game.  My wife really enjoys it.  There's just enough to keep adult's interest, and I can see how kids love the ghost aspect.  Nice board.  My kids are still too young too play this though.  Will reevaluate in a few years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprising that it's pretty fun. My 5yo son doesn't really 'get' it yet but I think after another play or two he'll understand the strategy better.

It's just a dice-fest and you're at the mercy of what's rolled, but it's still a fun game and exciting as Hugo moves closer to the players. Getting into one of the +3 rooms is great, but you better be careful if you try it!

Hope we get a number of years of play out of this.

This is a fun one for a mixed age crowded.  It plays well with six players and it often gets played with the four in our family plus two grandparents.  Easy to learn.

This is a cute game with a very fun theme.  The concept is very simple, but holds up even for adults when you feel like playing a light game that is easy on the brain.

very simple game, tried it with 2 players which was not very much fun, but I would like to try it with a bigger group before rating it.

Öten sikerült játszani vele. A 4 éves kislányomon kívül (aki túl hosszúnak találta) minden felnőtt élvezte a játékot egyszerűsége ellenére. A játékban Hugo elől menekülünk (aki a pince rejtekéből kerül elő) és próbálunk valamelyik üres szobába elbújni előle. Miután kockadobás dönti el mennyit léphetünk (Hugo fixen hármat lép), elég nagy a szerencse szerepe. Viszont a menekülés érzése izgalmassá teszi a játékot. Családoknak könnyű kikapcsolódásra ajánlott. (2017.04.10)

Midnight Party offers no depth. It is a bunch of pieces competing for limited safe zones before being captured by a ghost. Roll the right value or get caught.

Play with a group of right-minded people, however, and you're likely to have a good time. A good distraction and easy to teach to young children.

Dice movement games generally don't excite me much.  However, my girls reaction to this game was so immediate that the family as a group vote rates this game as fun and worthwhile.  Try to stay as far back from Hugo as possible.  The bonus rooms can be worth the risk but the more players you are the more chances there are that Hugo will catchup to you before making in there.  Lots of fun.

Better than some of the trash out there (after all, it's a Kramer game) but it still tastes too much like a roll-and-move for me to get my back into it. The tension feels so random that it's hard to really feel the scares beyond a tinge. That being said, the kids liked it and the theme is cute enough that I actually wouldn't mind getting stuck on this one again. But it's not a game I'd play with adults. A decent game for the youngsters.

Another one of those kiddie games that us adults like to play here and there. It brings back memories of the old Scooby-Doo cartoons. A very simple game of running around in circles till the ghost reaches the top of the stairs. Then everyone gets scared and starts dodging into rooms. The trick is that each room can only hold 1 person, so you better find one quick. This is one that is fun to play around Halloween.

In all fairness, this is really meant for the little kiddies.  I'm particularly a fan of Chris Lohroff's brilliant "Fast Hugo Strategy," in which he attempts to get Hugo to move as far as possible early in the game.  Also, you must actually gobble the party-goers with Hugo, not merely sweep them to the side like spoilsport Dave Vander Ark.  And if anyone knows how to beat the Fast Hugo Strategy, please email me!

Good with kids. There is not a ton of strategy, perhaps a little bit of push your luck, but it is the FEEL that really makes this game work. Watching the ghost get closer and closer, deciding to duck into a slightly less haunted room, clomping the ghost right over top of your opponent's partygoers, are all things that make this one worth playing, especially with excitable kids.

Someone brought this out touting it was a Wolfgang Kramer design, so perhaps it was worth giving a try.

20 minutes of my life that I will not get back.

Seriously, this is a roll-the-die racing game for children, ages 8-10. Had I known this, I would have suggested something else.

I don't own this but will capture a copy when I have an opportunity to get one at a good cost (>$5).  It's a very quick game and its great for all ages.  Hugo the ghost starts in the cellar and works his way up the stairs whenever his iconic image appears on the dice roll (a 3 and 6) and with the game dice, that happens A LOT!  We all think the game die is loaded.   The game can support up to 8 players but the more players, the fewer 'guests' each will control.  The goal is to avoid being captured by Hugo by hiding in rooms as Hugo roams the central hall but only one guest per room.  Negative scoring is based on how soon you are captured (earlier is bad).  The single die roll controls all movement so there is a lot of fun randomness and unpredictability.  that is part of the charm of this simple family/kid game.   Grab a copy if you can.  Especially if you have kids around.

[children's game??? 8]

initial rating one play 6 players ALL adults! 

This is a hard game to rate. It seems like it is a very simple game for children and adults should be embarrassed and not caught dead playing such a thing let along some Gamers yet 6 of us played this at a Con and had an absolute blast. (And I laughed even more when I found out that Herr Kramer designed this!) 

It is a very simple roll and move game where you start each round placing your two pieces in a circular hallway. Then everyone takes a turn rolling the dice where a number lets you move and a "ghost" symbol moves the ghost. The ghost starts in the cellar but quickly makes his way to the hallway where he starts devouring the players pieces if they haven't already 'hid' in a room. A little push your luck thrown in as some rooms might give you points if you make it to them. 

So you can see it is absurdly simple (which is definitely part of it's beauty) and does lack strategy, decisions, etc yet damn if it wasn't fun yelling "ghost, ghost, ghost" when someone was rolling hoping the ghost would kill him. 

An excellent game for kids and probably a fun drinking game for adults although no one at our table had any. If I play all adults again and it produces the same results my rating will go up to 7. More people the better, 4 would be too little, 6 or 7 probably best.

RATING: 4
I wanted to like this after reading that it works for adults, but... it didn't really. Part of it was probably how it seemed we always rolled a lot of non-ghosts to mostly empty the gallery, then rolled a lot of ghosts to clean out what was left. It was also a little awkward how at the start of each new round pieces popped out of their rooms only to pop right back in with any roll of the die. Clearly there are ways for players to approach the risks-and-rewards framework with its convoluted scoring system (add your negative points and subtract your positive points, any questions?), and I would try again to see if more balanced rolls could lead to more reactive play, but we're talking about a central mechanism where you have one chance in three of losing each of your turns.

I absolutely love playing this game when family game night includes our youngest, who is 7. Granted, luck is a significant factor, but you can mitigate it with good decisions. For instance, should I lose one or two points now to avoid being captured by the ghost and losing more points?  And, speaking of the ghost, who can't appreciate the TENSION and EXCITEMENT of a ghost nipping at your heels? My son actually squeals and does the belly dance when he escapes the ghost. And, I will admit that I grin with relief myself when I can slip into a room out of the ghost's reach. This game incites nail biting and laughter each and every time we play.

Roll and move. Hide and seek. Light party game. I like the revised rules. Two things in particular.

These rules make the game more exciting and fun.

I have found that a little attention and a good indoor or outdoor game trumps the mindless button pushing.

"Sardines - the board game".  A very light game - probably best played at midnight after a beer or two or with young children (preferably not both).  Under those conditions, great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays very quickly -- even the 3-year-old could stick it out for the full three rounds.

Not being able to move your pieces if you roll a ghost seems a little harsh (especially since 2 of the die faces are ghosts). We have therefore house-ruled it like Viva Topo, where you can still move 1 space before moving the ghost. Hugo is not catching quite as many guests, but there is a lot less frustration for the young players.

I'd say that Midnight Party and Viva Topo are essentially the same game. I prefer the illustrations, the antagonist (Hugo the ghost is way better than the cat), and the player count (2-8) from Midnight Party, and the player pieces (cute wooden mice) and scoring mechanism (cheese wedges are way easier for the kids to conceptualize than a score on paper) from Viva Topo. There are one or two other minor differences which I'm not bothering to go into here. Not getting rid of either game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Make it stop!  The only good thing about this game is that it is short.  Roll a die and hope you get to move a pawn.  Bleh.  The double damage of rolling a ghost (and not getting to move) is a bit much, and the +3 spots are not really worth the risk, making them pretty useless.

After several plays, I have lowered my rating to a 5, and I'm afraid it could go lower. My son really loved the ghost pawn. This is a nice, simple game that would be okay for a Halloween party. It's quick enough and silly enough that the heavy luck element isn't bothersome. It doesn't seem to have a lot of strategy, and frankly there doesn't seem to be a lot of decision making here. Just move and hope Hugo doesn't get to move when he's near you. I'm not sure exactly why, but the scoring seems a little annoying. Maybe it's just a little heavy on the bookkeeping [i]for the style of game[/i]. 

Thanks to skelebone for sending me a replacement for my broken pawn.

This (along with "Can't Stop") is one of my "food" games -- it's usually played while eating dinner, hence the high number of plays.  It's a simple game, slightly entertaining, and requires little strategy (and also doesn't have cards or many pieces)...so it's the perfect accompaniment to a meal.

Midnight Party is old-school game. Upon description it sounded like musical chairs with a ghost catching everyone who doesn't find a seat. In execution it was more like getting caught in a stampede.

It is basically a roll-and-move where if you roll poorly you don't even get a chance to move your characters at all. Instead you move the ghost which may catch your own people costing you points.

It has a funny, lighthearted theme. My single play of 3 rounds didn't match the theme though. Do the people in this house even know about the ghost? Then why aren't they moving at all? Based on the gameplay Midnight Party could have been re-themed as the city of Pamplona doing a handicapped-only edition of their famous bull run. Not very politically correct (neither was that statement), so it probably wouldn't have sold many copies.

Nulla di strategico o programmabile, ma un ottimo gioco per bambini o per tutta la famiglia dove l'allegria la fa da padrone grazie all'ambientazione che il gioco riesce a ricreare. Divertente e fortunoso è un giochino da trenta minuti di Kramer

[b]Midnight Party[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I had a blast playing this late at night during a con while enjoying some beers, it is a great party game. It is a very simple roll and move game, but it delivers in spades if you are playing with the right group. Midnight Party is an experience game and shines because of the stories told during and after the game, not because of the game play. I'm looking forward to getting together with the same group to play next year. If you get the chance to play this with a raucous bunch, I'd highly recommend checking it out.

[i]A quick aside, I'd recommend Spooky Stairs if you are looking for a great kid's game with a similar theme/concept. I think young kids will enjoy the game play of Spooky Stairs more and find it less frustrating.[/i]

Very fun children's game. Kids love the theme -- being chased by a ghost thru the hallways of mansion, trying to duck into a room for safety as the ghost catches up with them.  The scoring is weird, though.  Kids under 12 don't have a clue how to score this game where you accumulate negative rather than positive points.  But, don't let that stop you -- kids have a great time with this.

RATING: 7
fun fun fun.  Played several times in October 2003, usually with kids, and it was a crowd pleaser every time.  I love a game of this level of "seriousness" that still keeps a luck/skill/risk balance and this one does.  Further, it keeps everyone laughing, the excitement high, and avoids anti-climax if you remember to put everyone in the wine-cellar once all the rooms are full.  One beef: why the negative numbers?  just make them positive numbers and let the lowest score win... unfortunately the board art doesn't accomodate this scoring route and it may alienate the very young.  ah well, learn your negatives early lad if you want to keep up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I rate this highly as a tribute to it's versatility more than it's pure game design/excitement (there it's OK, but hardly great).  It's easy to explain, plays quickly with not much downtime, and (most importantly)  young children can play while adults can still enjoy it a little (played with my daughter when she was just barely 5, as well as my 8 year old son), and it scales from 2 all the way to 8 players.  

If there was a specific rating category for young families -- especially when having other young families over & the 6-8 of you wnat to do something all together -- then this might rightfully be the #1 ranked game in that category.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It is about as light as you can get. Roll and Move game. Run and hide in rooms and don't get eaten by the ghost Hugo. Points are bad. First person to 50 points loses. 

I lost. 

It was cute- But I really don't have to play that again. Maybe it just wasn't for me. The guys kept wanting to play...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update: The fiddly variant doesn't alleviate the constant going around and around, it makes it worse by being able to bump people out of a room and adds a little confusing Hugo movement mechanism to increase his speed.

If you like the thrill of being chased (and who doesn't?), this is nicely themed drama filled with push your luck risk. I can see kids getting a kick out of it, but I can't see this being an entertaining proposition for more than 3 players: once you've rolled, wait your turn with really nothing of competitive interest, only sit-com to savour which I guess will wear out.

RATING: 8.5
Very nice family-friendly game with heavy doses of theme and luck. Works for wide variety of ages and # of players. Exactly what I've been looking for the last few years on BGG.
Another successful family-game research and purchase. Picked it up (and Amazing Labyrinth) on EBay for $20 shipped.
Actually, I had one bad session which made me lower the rating from 8.8 to 8.5, and make me re-think the number of players for this game. With 2 or 3 players, Hugo may not be rolled for a long time and each player gets frequent rolls - they can actually out-run Hugo! I saw a player make 3 laps around the board (granted, I missed the rule that said the round is over as soon as all the rooms are filled, but he still had made it around 1 or 2 laps before they filled up).
So I'd recommend this game for at least 4 players - the more the better, actually (up to 8).

We always play with my made-up house rules, with the skeleton key (can be used once to open a closed door) and the ghost shield (can be used once to block/dodge Hugo).

Play is like this: After partygoers are placed each round, the Key is spun in between the -1 rooms and placed in whichever room it is pointing to.
Whoever gets a person in the key room picks up the key to be used anytime (in a future round, or useable immediately?) to open up any closed room.
The Ghost Shield is placed in the turret up the stairs from the locked door of the art room. If someone has the Key, they could open up the art room and go up the stairs (needs 1 extra movement) and grab the Shield. The Shield can be used to protect against Hugo grabbing one of your characters once. Hugo just goes right on by, and doesn't see your character.

I'm sure it plays very differently with 5 and 6 since Hugo has so many chances to move between turns. EDIT: Have played more with a friend and his son. It's funny that the little one has favorite rooms that he will only hide in, therefore, really messing him up!

Kind of fun. I made my own version out of legos to test it before I bought it. The scoring is hard for kids, since more then likely the scores will all be negatives.

Roll-and-move board game version of musical chairs. Fun enough as a light filler on Halloween. But remake it with a Doctor Who licence, call it "EXTERMINATE!", and the Whovians would be all over it.

This might be my favorite childhood game. Hugo, the ghost, is simply the best. Pure fun and as I recall quite tense, too, once you try to run away from him. The design is simply great. Since the dice mostly decides who makes it one can perfectly combine kids and adults, and it will be fun for both, actually it is for all age groups, one of those, one must be a real grinch to resist its charme. My future kids will 100% get a copy!!

This, at ages 6 to now 8, is my daughter;s favorite push your luck game.  She likes the theme and the board and the components a lot.  I'm not sure about how the individual rounds work though, since your pieces come out of the rooms they're in--if you're in one of the value rooms and you roll a one you get to pop right back in, which doesn't seem particularly fair...and it did annoy my daughter quite a bit when her mom rolled 3 ones on three consecutive turns and re-took the positive value rooms again immediately.  It seems like you should have to either not be allowed to re-take a room you just exited, or should have to exit the room and advance one square when the round 'resets.'

One of my all time favorites.  That Hugo is one cool dude, racing around the balcony and putting my enemies on the staircase!!!!  Beware, the more players, the slower your pawns will seem to go, especially if you roll a ghost on your turn, you're doomed, Hugo gets many turns to your one!!!  Great filler for a night of serious gaming.  Fun for all ages.

RATING: 6
This is in the same family of Kramer games as Viva Pamplona! and the recent SdJ nominee Verflixxt!  As a strategy game, Mitternachtsparty is the weakest of a deliberately weak bunch.  Even accepting that you're at the mercy of the dice, your token's chance of being "scared" off the board by Hugo the Ghost is pretty darned arbitrary, and the scoring for it is pretty darned arbitrary, too.  Nevertheless!  This is a fun game to play, accommodating children old enough to count and adults young enough to enjoy a silly romp.  And it really does take eight players.  So give it a try and look forward to some laughs.

RATING: 5
[Ravensburger 'Mitternachtsparty' 1989 edition] {Horror, Beer&Pretzels; roll-and-move; optimal 4-6p} Midnight party is an interesting game for children. It's fun and loud. It's hilarious to see that the guests are being captured by the ghost. Adults will find it too easy.

The game is nicely made. The illustration of "Mitternachtsparty" is a little bit busy. I prefer Hugo more.

RATING: 6
Not much of a jump from games of pure chance, but that could be a good thing. Great for board game beginners who don't want complex strategy or rules. Most of the strategy comes from positioning your pieces at the beginning and where & when to move.

Stasera al castello c’è il ballo, nobili e dame accorsi da tutto il regno si divertono nel salone. Improvvisamente, quando l’orologio batte la mezzanotte, la porta delle segrete si apre scricchiolando. Ugobaldo, il fantasma del castello, s’intrufola nel salone e tutti gli ospiti fuggono all’impazzata! Ognuno cerca di nascondersi come può nella prima stanza libera.

Ogni giocatore cerca di evitare che Ugobaldo catturi i propri Ospiti e li porti nelle segrete. I giocatori ricevono Punti Terrore per ogni proprio Ospite catturato. Solo chi riesce a fuggire e a chiudersi in una stanza può evitare di essere preso. Il giocatore che dopo tre round ha meno Punti Terrore, vince.

RATING: 5
A classic roll-and-move game from the 80's. Each player has several guests at a mansion that run around in circles until a ghost appears and they try to get into a limited number of rooms before a ghost eats them. Each turn you roll a die and either move one of your guys (2/3 chance) or move the ghost (1/3) chance. It pretty much boils down to whether or not you roll a ghost on your turn. Not much to see here, but there is a pretty sweet Ghost piece that can completely engulf the people as it moves.

Rollicking good fun with kids and adults.  Hugo is faster than you would think... wait until someone starts chanting "Come on Hugo, come on Hugo, come on Hugo" as the die is rolled. I own the Ravensburger edition.  I would love to get a copy of the 2003 Amigo German version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun with kids and I love that it plays up to 8 players, but there are many others I would choose with adults only. 

There is a certain sweet innocence that this game has that not all games, kid's game or otherwise. It makes me feel wholesome somehow. Even when I call Hugo a f*#%er.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.25

Featuring Hugo the ghost....and lots of meeples before they were meeples.

This presentation is superb in each and every facet.  From the star of the show,  that apparition Hugo,  right down to the finely detailed board,  which brings the theme to a rapid boil.

It may be difficult to pinpoint just where the high level of fun that is had in this simple race from the wraith derives from.  My suggestion is that you be apathetic as to the cause - and just take delight in the effect.

When you are playing in a casual group, when you are in holiday mood, this is a great fun game. It brings you hilarious laughters and screams throughout the game, even it's a very simple roll-and-move game. Do not under-estimate this unwelcome mechanic. Though the rules is playable by 2-7 players, I recommend it as a 4-5 players game, where the tension and available options is better.

Not strategically challenging, but a lot of fun to play with the right crowd.  We had a player think for a few moments on where to place his first piece, and we all told him he was already thinking too hard about the game.  That being said, it's probably better with more players, just for the added chaos.

Like Kramer's other children's game I've played (Gulo Gulo), the rules seem just a bit more complex than they should be (the scoring, in particular - I hope later editions streamline this). Unlike Gulo Gulo, this doesn't have a lot to recommend it over the mainstream competition. It's not a bad game, but it fails to be a great one. Like 7 Wonders, it seems to be at its best with fewer people, but what drew me to it in the first place was it's support for higher numbers. I have lots of good, simple games for 4; I was hoping for one for 8.

Hugo is an unwavering apparition who whets his appetite on fear and devours the souls of young children and their parents - casting them into limbo until time collapses and the universe's cyclical grind begins again.

That wouldn't be so bad, except that the die makes Hugo move too quickly and the game doesn't scale well.

I rate it much higher (7 or 8) if you get 7 or 8 players.  This game really plays different when the ghost can move halfway around the board before you get your next turn.  I find the real strategy in the game is all in the setup for the upcoming round (and therfore your choice of a room is important because it determines your setup for the next round).  I can't think of a better turn based boardgame with respect to many players and minimal downtime.

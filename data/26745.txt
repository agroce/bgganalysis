Great components... Some nice tweaks... 

Unfortunately, the informational counters tend to distract and the impulse system slows the game down.

All in all, it feels too cumbersome for the sort of "smooth" game it should/could have been.
 
Too bad, I really wanted this to be the heir apparent of platoon-level combat.

I am really enjoying this game so far.  I have played the first couple of scenarios and will be starting PB Carentan also.  Version 2 rules are a vast improvement, and the game plays fast.  The chit pull system adds an element of the fog of war, with the potential for the initiative to change back and forth. I am looking forward to more scenarios and modules in the future.

About 4 plays in, and I always get a kick out of this and am upping the rating. PanzerBlitz certainly is not perfect. The rules could use significant improvement. The charts and aids are a bit of a mess and in need of revision. There can sometimes be problems with endgame pacing in larger scenarios and with counter density - lots of "spent" markers and piles of Bren carriers. These are not insignificant problems, but PB also does a ton of stuff well, is easy and reasonably intuitive to get into, and grabs you quickly. It gets the pacing generally right, combat has a good level of lethality, finding a good middle ground between the ultra-lethal (and so not very nuanced) Conflict of Heroes and the tedious ineffectiveness of TCS or Combat Commander. The command rules are simple but effective. The tactics generate interesting choices and are historically evocative. The game scales well from small-ish scenarios up to the bigger stuff. The game includes a very good mix of scenarios which show off the game's range, provide a good variety, and are reasonably well-balanced and interesting.

All in all, this has been a very pleasant surprise and I hope they can do a couple more modules, hopefully including some Soviets and Americans and maybe some ASLSK-style geomorphic maps.
---
Rating is just a first impression, but I really enjoyed it. Sure, it's still PanzerBlitz, so it's still a little gamey, some of the funky stuff we know and love is still in there and it's not a hard simulation, but it's got a good feel and the impulse-based system works rather well. And the scenario was tense and tough, and felt like it had been actually playtested. I look forward to playing it some more, especially after having played so many dysfunctional wargames of late. A fine upgrade of a genuine classic from the 70s.

The rules definitely are not great, but they aren't as terrible as they've been made out to be either, especially not in comparison with so many recent flaming wrecks of rules sets, including Fields of Fire, Pursuit of Glory, Halls of Montezuma, and The Devil's Cauldron, just to pick a few. Well-meaning players should be able to cope with some oddities.

Really enjoying game. It plays smoothly. Game mechanics are clearly derived from the older versions of the game (and it's good IMO, as I like them a lot). Yet the injection of chit pulling and the consequent fragmented activation of units works really well.

I would rate it a 10 if rules were better written (even version 2.0 IMO is still not up to the quality of the game) and if geomorphic mapboards were included (the game, as it stands now - including game components as mapboard and counters - is not a game system as they are the parent games PL/PB & AIW).

(Note, I'm talking about the original published version - I am aware of changes since then, but I am not talking about those here).

First, let me emphasize that this is NOT “Panzerblitz, second edition”.  The design really is different enough that they should be considered two separate designs.

The game looks good, the designers and developers put a lot of hard work into it, and I think there is a good design there, but...the rules are, in my opinion, a mess.

The LOS rules in particular are just plain wrong – they are very badly organized, contradictory, and impossible to use.  I actually re-wrote the entire section and the game’s official editor posted them BoardGameGeek.  I’ve heard hints that a re-write may be in the works, but I wasn't interested.

I also just don't like the activation mechanic - there is nothing wrong with the way it works, but it just doesn't work for me.  While clever, the chit pull for activation to me fails to represent anything other than a way to mix up the action.  While in essence much the same as the way Panzer Grenadier does it, at least in Panzer Grenadier losses can reduce your command potential while in PBHoD no such degradation of command potential occurs – the less units you have the more likely you will have command control over them.

This game is as much fun today as the original Panzerblitz was to me in the 70's.
Although I had more game time then, then I do now.
It did take me awhile to get through the rules-and I see by the comments I was not alone.
I still rate a 9 as an overall great value game that I will play again soon.

Panzerblitz HoD is a light game with enough rules extras to bring it above the status of  beer & pretzels wargaming. The Ops counters (for activating units) are interesting, but I have already noticed that they influence 'bunching up' - not good for artillery!

I bought this game a while ago and am finally playing it.  I have played two situations, seven and eight, a few times and am getting a feel for the rules.  I am enjoying the game play a lot.  I definitely feel I made the right Choice in purchasing this game.  I like the tactical scale of this game.  The rules do not seem that bad and coming from a Panzer Grenadier playing background some of the ideas were similar. I am looking forward to the next box game in the series which is supposed to be Modular.

Just played scenario 4 and as the Brits. Pipped at the post by an expert Wehrmacht commander! Actually a thoroughly good gaming experience of the old school style. This is perhaps not as refined as TCS which has taken the high ground at this level, but its very well done and plays out in near war movie fidelity, definitely worth a spin (I put some pics and a review together in the sessions folder).
 Will update this once played. More interested in the actual battle than in whether this is a suitable successor to PB or PL (which I somehow doubt bearing in mind I owned both of these in the 70's and only see them thru' an old guys rose tinted lens of nostalgia :-))

 I love the box and the armor type descriptions on the back, it keeps up with the old tradition. The counters are excellent, the map and setup charts are great and once I got over a few bumps in the rules, the game played out well. I played the first scenario: First Crack and it was very close, right to the end. I definitely recommend this game. After waiting well over 15 years for the re-make, lets hope the next modules in the series don't take as long. I am just not sure how to rate this game? Maybe it was the long wait that makes it difficult.

I've owned this for the best part of 2 years and I've not seriously considered playing it, nor can I imagine doing so. Now that's: Tigers, Panthers, Churchills, Bren carriers and lots of other lovely stuff; all in Normandy; and I just can't summon up any enthusiasm for it? A bit of a shocker really. I blame the rules: they're convoluted, hard to grasp, and generally uninspiring. What a disappointment.

I find the game to be exciting and it captures a lot of the original's feeling without the more unrealistic effects. The interplay of actions via the chit picks resutls in a great move-reaction-opportunity fire sequence which feels very realistic. 

The new combat system gives units seperate anti tank and anti-people factors which reduces the effect of making tanks with great high velocity tank killing guns alos good for killing soldiers. The new system also does away with the old gang up of the pygmys and kill the tiger effect of PB. 

The main flaw is the rules book. Reasonable gamers should be able to igured it out ( but it means the first half of one's first game is a drag before it clicks)

A completely new modernized version.  Hmmm....I am much more interested in tactical level wargames nowaday than 2 decades ago. So maybe it's time to return to the old Panzerblitz days...Looks like a playable game and the game now goes historical, not geomorphic map.  I like the change.  The counters art on the panzers and tanks are also upgraded to more detaied depiction, no longer simple black sihoutte.

Once you get past the rules, the game is really not that complex. Some definite referencing will happen when dealing with LOS and some of the special attacks and whatnot, but overall it seems like a solid little system. 

BUT: 
You do get some clumping of units which just doesn't feel natural due to the Ops chits. And flanking/maneuvering seem to just not work as well due to units getting stranded a bit. Things seem to devolve into a clusterf**k of units.

Combat also seems to have very little happening. Yeah I acknowledge that I have bad luck with dice, but it just seems so difficult to destroy any units. Heck you can't even seem to move them...so your clumps of units just seem to sit there all game trying to kill a few units.

I love all the different armor, transports, gun pieces and units though. And it has nice components.

Just didn't grab me, I tried.

Not Panzerblitz any more. This is Panzerblitz New Age. Units need to be activated by using a chit-pull system. Complexity is greater than old game. Game counters are overloaded with new information. Too many status counters. Rules are fiddly. I might enjoy the game more if the map hexes were bigger allowing placement of status counters in the hex with the unit instead of on top of unit. Many scenarios use miniscule part of the map - would enjoy better if larger hex map were provided in these cases with terrain hex counters.

Need more plays to properly rate.  Played HD08 as a learning scenario and spent too much time with my face in the rulebook which IMO is a little rough. The next version of the rulebook needs: a historical overview as an introduction, an expanded illustrated example of play (to pull everything together), examples on how to use the LOS chart, an index, incorporated errata, and a few rewrites for clarity.

A much better game than the carping led me to believe.  Head and shoulders above Panzergrenadier, for instance.  New rules seem pretty tight,  a draft copy is available on CSW.

Very preliminary rating after reading rules and pushing through one situation as a beta test.

Pros: Counters/depictions, operations/movement/combat rules seem pretty tight and fun.

Cons: Map is a bit bland and possibly innaccurate with respect to field and hedge terrain in this area.  There are barely any designer's notes and no formal introduction to or description of the game.  The LOS rules are probably fine as conceived but as written they are fairly confusing.  Only 8 situations.

Will revise rating after playing more situations.

    这游戏系统不错，值得一试~我喜欢。
    作为一款战棋游戏，PB：HoD具有许多可圈可点的地方，譬如价格低廉，规则平易近人等，但最令人值得称赞的还是游戏的美工。该游戏的算子（counter）设计精美、小巧玲珑（1/2英寸），让人有种爱不释手的感觉。由于是战棋大厂MMP出品，算子的厚度适中，游戏时摸在手里的感觉非常好。在算子上标明了单位的基本信息，这些信息排摆的错落有致，十分好辨认。算子上还配有单位的图画，比起其他战棋游戏算子的符号标记美观了不少。

    在战棋游戏里最重要的就是游戏系统，一个好的游戏系统能让一个系列经久不衰（如ASL），PB：HoD在游戏系统方面做的非常不错，该游戏属于战术级战棋，部队采用排级编制，格式是传统的hex-counter，玩家行动机制使用了一方行动然后另一方行动的顺序（IGoYGo），在战斗方面采用了经典的移动——战斗规则。为了方便初学者，PB：HoD简化了行军和补给等方面细节。

    总结一下，PB：HoD是一款经典的战棋游戏，需要良好的策略和管理能力，如何利用有限的部队守住阵地、击溃敌人是每个玩家都需要考虑的问题。虽然目前PB：HoD在BGG排名不是很靠前，但是凭借良好的操作性和丰富的可玩性，使得该游戏还是值得每个桌游玩家尝试一下的。

I think this is an excellent WW2 Western Front tactical game- not overloaded with units to make it unmanagable nor too complex to be unplayable.  I think it strikes a great balance between "realism" and playability. As for the criticisms about the command system "making" units bunch up: read some history on the Normandy campaign- it happened a lot and the side that did it usually paid for it in blood. So when it happens in the game it is reflecting the difficulties of young officers and NCOs coping with the difficulties of leading under fire.  My two cents.

Neat update, of Panzerblitz that sought to fix a lot of the issues with that game and Panzer Leader, but has some of it's own.  I didn't like that MMP re-launched PB with a historical campaign, instead of a modular game.  It's a pain to only ever be using parts of the somewhat large one-sheet map at any one time.  You also only get British and German troops, and if you're not that interested in Normandy or playing the Brits, you might not be that interested.  There's also a lot of shuffling informational markers around, so it's a bit fidgity.  That said, I like the way units are rated better in this game than it's antecedents, and I like the artillery rules better.

Not having played the original game this a fresh eyes look at the game. This game has been sitting on my shelf unplayed since it was first published. I'd read a number of reviews beforehand so was acutely conscious that the game had received some fairly negative reviews. We played Take the Hill, using the updated Rulebook. I was defending the hill and it looked like tall order for the British to achieve the victory conditions. What a cracking game it turned out to be, we a made a few errors  and one or two elements were buried in the rules but overall it was very enjoyable gaming experience and one that we will return to in the future. The scenario had all the historical elements of the battle. Highly recommended, very tense and balanced scenario after a few playing I can see that once the tactical nuances of the system have revealed themselves to the players scenarios will become very, very tense affairs. I had expected the casualty rate to be a lot higher and the system to be quite simplistic, but it wasn't in slightest how I imagined it would play. Highly recommended!

I preordered this in early 2006 and received it in April 2009.  In the mean time, I started playing Combat Commander.  P: HoD suffers in comparison to CC.  HoD seems to be much fiddlier and has rules that are more difficult to understand and use.  The game play doesn't seem to justify the start-up cost.

My only Multiman Publishing games before HoD were Shifting Sands and A Victory Lost (both of which are very good), so I had assumed that I'd be getting that level of clarity in the rules, but that turned out not to be the case.  It may be the case that a tactical game is just that much harder to present, but both CC (which I rate a 9) and Conflict of Heroes (a 7 for me) do a better job than HoD.

Traded away for Starship Troopers.

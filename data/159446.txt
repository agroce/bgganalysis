The underdog (dice) worker placement game. I do not like the art work, but still, I love this game! 
The game has so much intertwined aspects, everything interacts in some way which makes the decision making hard and fantastic.
The game seems very dry and complex, but the rules are well written and very short. The game playing time is also nice and short.

Solid dice placement in an Ancient Greek setting, with the added element of conflict with and against the Titans. The game reminds me a lot of Troyes (a favorite of mine), with the Underworld Titans taking the place of the raids you face there, so you'll have to make sure you arm yourself to prepare each round, but then Bernd has also added in an element of player dueling, an Arena! Lot of nifty ideas at work here, and alongside Peloponnes it's on of my favorite of his designs yet. I do wish the graphic design was a little more attractive but it's functional in its own humble way (sort of like Trajan).

Great workerplacement game with some bite. This game feels little bit like Lancaster mixed with Carson city and Le havre. The graphic design is a mixed bag. I wish there was no mix of pictures and painted artwork. Besides that i recommend the game to all workerplacement fans. I like that there are different endings based on how the play unfolds. I like the duels (inspired fron carson city?) The game has no new mechabic to offer. But it works well and the game has tension and player interaction.

Clash of the Titans!!! You are trying to defeat the Titans that come to the city by using Titans that you summon/acquire, but at the same time you are dueling with other players using your Titans. All of this while at the same time trying to run your city efficiently (standard Euro fare).

Interesting worker placement, worker upgrading and fighting game where you use dice to get actions depending on the level of your workers/dice. The higher your worker/die level the better the action. There is player interaction galore and with the right group a lot of whooping and hollering as you are dueling each other.

It's a fun game that needs to be approached with the right mental attitude. The different end game conditions makes for interesting choices on which path to take. This is not normally my style of game because of the randomness (I'm a heavy Euro Gamer), but it was fun and engaging while retaining some interesting decisions and innovative mechanics.

RATING: 5
Some very interesting worker placement mechanics ruined by a very bad currency/bidding system with the Titans.

Success in the game boils down to your Titans--their strength and type--as there is no viable path to victory without them. But the strength of the Titans is totally random: one player could draw three "9" power Titans in the first round, where another player could only get "5"s. Since defending the city and fighting in the arena are both crucial for winning the game, and since you can "save" your Titans with the discs, the player with "9"s will easily win the game. 

No game in which bidding is so crucial should have such a wide spread among randomly-distributed currency. I think taking out all the "5"s and "9"s might help to fix the game, but I'm not going to be the one to do the work playtesting it. Sold.

RATING: 7
A very interesting strategy game, quite heavy.
The iconography on the board should be clearer (the use of harbour/market for instance), and the rules should allow the compensation of lacking tiles and tokens at the end of the game.

Heavier than expected worker placement game.  There is a lot going on.  The workers are either building an engine for later turns, taking resources for later VP harvesting, or building military strength for both attacking and defense.  The competition for slots is tight, which I like in worker placement games, but there is a lot of randomness in the tile draws.  If you invest one of your workers to take the start player token, then you might get first shot at an awesome tile, or you might get worthless tiles.  Quite a crapshoot.

A great year game that many people don't know about. The theme and artwork are a bit strange but it works. The mechanisms are great and there is a sense of growth within the game. There is some take that in the duelling phase but it's not as harsh as you would think. I look forward to playing this one again.

Panthalos could have been just another tired worker placement game, but the addition of the titans and the opportunity to battle each other adds an extra dimension. However, it is this blending of ideas that could be the games downfall. I really appreciate what Panthalos is trying to achieve, but feel that it runs the risk of falling between two stools. The combat element may put off the more peace-loving eurogamer, whilst all that Mediterranean trading and low key artwork just isn’t going to appeal to a certain school of jaded gamer.

Explained the game at Essen 2014.

(Very) Good game, one of Bernd's best designs for me. A nice take on the WP mechanic.

The game plays fast and offers quite a few interesting choices. Having the option to fight other players is a nice touch, too.

All in all it sounds very common, but feels fresh. The threat of the titans (and players) plus the scarcity of eveything forms a nice game.

Rating may go up with more plays, but not down for sure.

Given how much I like Peleponnes, this was a bit disappointing.  Wheras Peleponnes was pared down and direct, this one seemed a lot more convoluted, and the number of interesting options only decreased as the game went on.  The improving workers interesting, but I never really felt locked out of actions and the higher values only got you more of the same stuff.  The battles with the enemy Titan were too easy, and battling other players didn't really net you too much.

Interesting dice placement game with a somewhat convoluted and Byzantine set of interlocking mechanisms. The game felt a little rough around the edges and left me wanting more. The graphic design is also a bit of a mess.

I don't think I'd seek this one out to play again, but I'd probably give it another shot if the opportunity presented itself.

A rating of 7 seems like damning with faint praise - the problem with Panthalos is that it doesn't feel distinctive enough to stand out from the Worker Placement crowd despite being a more challenging test of tactical and strategic choice than I was expecting.
The direct player conflict is interesting but perhaps a little too random as the key tile draws are all hidden so - beyond the neat "bonus transformation" chits - it is virtually impossible to know whether or not duels are worthwhile, given that they are liable to leave you open in return (having said that, taking the arena action as a defensive play is clearly a good plan.) 
I liked the seeming variety of victory paths, but I'm not sure I want to play it enough to find out if they are sufficiently distinctive.

Played once with 5P. Panthalos is a medium-weight worker placement game with a few expected twists in the way workers are handled. Like in [thing=96913][/thing], workers can be upgraded to increase their scope of actions. Also, used workers retire to the Thermae for an entire round to recuperate, giving rise to a rhythm in how players access their workers.

One of the main attractions here are duels, which involve a little luck in tile-pulling and a good memory for the Titan tiles each player has. I don't find the duels interesting, but I appreciate how the mechanism influences the placement of leaders and gives players opportunities to bluff.

Anyway, the biggest draw for me is the alternate endgame condition of the Krypt filling up with discs. As the scoring criteria is affected by the endgame scenario, players can be incentivised to place discs there to rein in players who are a little too successful in the Arena, although this also comes at a personal cost.

Panthalos works well as a whole, although I think it has a hard time standing out in a saturated genre. Nothing in its gameplay is particularly compelling, or hasn't been implemented before in more attractive titles. And while the graphics succeed function-wise, the realistic illustrations of the titans and element icons look jarring against the rest of the visual scheme.

If the designer gives a strategy tip that says 'you eon't win unless you win a duel' it should not be ignored.

letting one player dominate this part of the game is a big mistake.

Intriguing and vaguely old school Worker Placement game in which you can bash other players with your Titans.

The workers are dice and they can (and need to be) improved during the game to score VPs at the end and also to take some restricted actions. 

I liked the fact workers have to rest for a round after use, this speeds up the game and creates an interesting rhythm to play.

tl;dr: decent unoffensive euro
Ever since [thing=42910][/thing] everyone's been keeping an eye on [person=2790][/person]'s output. So far he has been hit-and-miss with me. I like [thing=101020][/thing] a lot, I hated [thing=103191][/thing].
This game is a worker placement where the dice are workers and the values of the dice - which can be influenced of course - determine what actions they can be used for. There's resource generation and point generation based on those resources. There's also 2 ways to combat. The first is with the game where every player has to defeat the same enemy for points or not do so and risk losing points. The second is where you can attack an other player in which case it's sort of majorities with cards of a certain suit.
That's all fine and dandy, and it works fine, but it's all so unoriginal. It's just more of what we have seen so much of, and it's not like the combinations are fresh or work way better than anywhere else.
So, all in all a decent, unoffensive euro that failed to excite me.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
BGG scale: 6/10

A Euro with a dash of Ameritrash. I really enjoyed this game. Solid dice/worker placement. Seems to work well will different player counts. The theme works well and is one I enjoy. The art could have been better for the elements. Some luck involved with the drawing of titans. Still I really enjoyed this game.

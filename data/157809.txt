The Good: A dice game that doesn't use Yahtzee as a base. It has a fantastic tech tree effect for as simple of a game as it is (which I would expect from Civ-style games) in that you exchange dice that you have for new specialized dice. The varied ways of gathering points, such as through wonders, books, or meeting needs, is a nice touch. Again, expected for a Civ game. Last, the dice are really well made and the game plays very very fast (we can bang out a game in maybe 15 minutes). Not a hard game to teach or pickup. I guess it says something about a game that I've bought it multiple times...

The Bad: It takes almost as long to setup/tear down as it does to play, so you end up playing a couple games right in a row to justify taking the box top off. The tiles are rather devoid of any thematic integration and are all sort of interchangeable. Solo mode is close to laughably easy without using a BGG variant to simulate the another player.

Great, quick filler game. It's not a true "civ" but it keeps enough of the gist of the original Nations game. I just wish that the starter nations/civilizations had actual variety to them other than color. Future expansion?

I like the dice, all custom and coming in four different designs. I also like how the development of your civilisation is abstracted by adding more dice to your pool. Furthermore, the short play time and simple rules are a big bonus.

However, I think they have gone a bit too light here. Sure Nations Dice Game is heavier than, say Roll Through the Ages, but not much. Development is kind of unsatisfying because the buildings, leaders, wonders, regions and event cards are also all too similar to each other. There is no real difference between them. No cunning combos. No special benefits. All you get from them is just new dice, re-rolls, victory points or resource tokens.

To summarise all the things said above, Nations: The Dice Game is by no means a bad game. It works and plays fast, at least. The thing just is that it is not as satisfying as it could be for a Civ fan. 

Update 2014-11
6 -> 7
We played this wrong at the first time. Instead of moving the resource tokens to you spent resource pool, we  discarded them completely upon spending. This took a lot of the feel of progress from the game. I still think that the development cards could have provided a bigger variety but with the correct rules the game is definitely a keeper.

A decent longer-length filler/short game.  Enough strategy to keep you interested.  I think I marginally prefer Giganten der Luft when it comes to dice rolling and engine building, but this is worthy.

*Rating based on one play.

+Captures the feel of the Nations card game in a lighter, quicker package.
+Good components.

=Fair dose of randomness makes it even more of a tactical game than its big brother and limits long-term planning.

-Not a lot of variety in the tiles.
-Theme feels even more pasted on than the card-game version.
-No special civilization starting powers.

This does for Nations what Roll for The Galaxy did for Race for The Galaxy. The game is far more accessible than the regular board game, an easier teach, and still manages to scratch that same civ builder itch with significantly less downtime per player. Granted, the dice aspect makes the game more tactical than strategic but it also makes it shorter and easier to play. Unlike the heavier original game, if I know I am losing early on, I don't have to wait a few hours to officially get there. This is a solid medium to light weight filler or post game down time sort of endeavor and I am very happy with it.

Nations: The Dice Game is a more complex dice game (still simple enough for families) with a civilization theme. I like it much more than Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age which is, as well, a good dice game for travelling but with too much laborious math for goods each turn. 
Nations: The Dice Game has a short playtime which is why I like it more than Nations. Nations the board game felt for me too anti-climatic: no memorable highlights happend within the long playtime and each epoch played pretty much the same. Unlike the board game, the dice game has no relative tracks for stability and military power. Interaction is now more direct by just having most symbols of a kind at the end of an epoch.
Surprisingly, I find Nations the dice game less luck-prone than Nations the board game: if no progression tile of a particular type is drawn, it can be quite a bummer in the board game. The dice game has less types of tiles and you depend less on a particular type.
The artwork is only okay for both the board and dice game.

Does this distill Nations The Board Game down into a dice game? MMmmmmm... sort of? 
Don't get us wrong we enjoy this much more than nations if for nothing else than it cuts the game play time by about 75-80%. But it does not give you the feel of a civ game. Several of the mechanism are the same and the scoring isn't nearly so complicated. So while it is similar in theme, it doesn't really give you that feel of building up an empire. Still a very fun game though. Plus you get to roll dice. never anything wrong with that.

While dice games aren't my type of game, I was a bit surprise at how light this game was. Mechanically speaking, it is a Yahtzee-esque dice game with some engine building. But considering that Nations is a solid medium-weight game... I was expecting something more substantial. In practice, this is a filler and quite generic.

The game is almost like an abstract civilization game. I enjoy the specialized dice that are available. However, it's hard for me to get too excited by this game because, despite the "theme" and ways to reroll the dice, it's still a dice chucking fest with a lot of luck involved. Getting a high score really only means the dice were lucky and the tiles came out in a very fortunate way for you.

What do you do if you have a successful board or card games these days? You bastardize the theme and throw it on a so-so dice game. I love Nations, so I had to try it. To be honest, I had fun with this game and it was easy to learn IF you already know Nations. I doubt those unfamiliar with Nations would understand how this game is abstracted. In my opinion, if a game is good enough, it doesn't need to paste on a theme of another successful game. I don't think this game would be popular by any other title.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This one really does feel like Nations, which was a little surprising.  It really does seem like there are multiple paths to victory, and the game does give you some tough choices even in such a light game.  I do wish there was more tiles, but it is cool that you do not use them all even in a 4 player game (there is 3 left).  This isn't going to be for someone who can't deal with a game with randomness (but what dice game is?), but I enjoy it, and I plan to explore this one further.

Much prefer this version over the full game as I felt the full game was too punishing and tight where this version gives you a bit more freedom.  It definitely pays diversify on your dice early because if you get them too late you can't take advantage of the new sides effectively.  But for me the game just doesn't have any excitement, and maybe the tension of the big game is what brought it but it was too over the top there, and just not existent here.

Update - 7/28/2015

I got this to the table for two more plays last night, this time with four players. I felt that it played better with four players versus three. I don't think it was perticularly well received with my gaming group, the general consensus seemed to be 'Is this it?'. Overall I'd say this isn't a bad game as long as your ok with light games. I'm not sure that I'd recommend to play this game, but if someone else wanted to play it I wouldn't turn them down.

A wee bit chaotic but, hey, what did you expect from a dice game with a random tile draw! But a wee bit chaotic is actually fine for a game of this type that plays so quickly and - mostly - presents you with tough decisions every turn. Moreso at the start of each round admittedly, when there's more tiles available, but it can also be tricky when you're down to a few tiles left. Does anyone ever go for agriculture in the last couple of rounds though, except in desperation? 

There's a decent arc to the game too - notable in such a quick game - with a lot more capacity and options in the last two rounds ... though without slowing the game down too much. While I've a nagging suspicion that the first player advantage is too strong, our results don't bear that out ... which is reassuring, if annoying! 

A very decent filler then, with enough of a flavour of the fuller game that you can tell they're related by more than just the marketing; a success.

RATING: 7
I thought this was fun, if certainly not on the same level as "professional" dice games like Ra: The Dice Game, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, or Ciub (or - maybe! - Roll for the Galaxy?). It just a light dice-rolling game without a ton going on or much in the way of strategy, and where you can get totally hosed through no fault of your own. But it's quick, plays smoothly, and there is a bit of cleverness to managing your dice pool. Still, I think that too much effort was put into modeling the original Nations game and not really enough into making it a game that justifies itself.

Still, having said all that, I enjoyed and would play again. Short, light, flavorful filler isn't super-common these days. Then again, "filler" is a category of games that I have come to have little to no use for.

RATING: 5
I felt like this was a fairly boring dice game, with not many interesting decisions to be had.  Many times, it just felt like the game was playing me.  Roll the dice, and see what's available to do with the results.  Yes, there are some re-roll tiles you can accumulate to offer a little more control, but it just wasn't that exciting.

I also felt like, while there are a lot of tiles, there weren't many interesting differences in them.  Perhaps this is an unfair critique since this will inevitably be compared to Nations, which has a lot of very interesting cards and tactical decision making based on the cards, but the tiles in this just didn't seem very interesting.

Overall, a miss for me, but the game this is based on, Nations, continues to be one of my favorite games of all time!  So, if you didn't care for Nations:The Dice Game and haven't played Nations, you should still give Nations a try!

RATING: 7
Fun dice game that captures the essence of the base game but offers it in a much lighter and much shorter experience. I love the variability from game to game with the various tiles that can come out each age and there are multiple ways to achieve victory. The game is obviously very random since it's dice-based, but I wish there were a couple of extra ways to mitigate bad luck because some bad rolls can really hurt your game. Also, if only of couple of dice tiles come out during an age, the last player in turn order can really be put in a bad spot if we cannot upgrade his dice. Thankfully the game plays very quickly so it's still a fun game that any gamer can enjoy.

Really cool little game where you roll dice and try and acquire power ups while also trying to score points. For a 30 minute game that actually let's you build an engine, it's pretty good.

A great filler, plays quickly with tough decisions and the idea of getting new tiles and able to roll those dice for the current round is pretty slick. Very rarely do we play games twice in a row, but we did this one as neither game was over 45 minutes. The only thing to be careful for is the last round is all about gaining victory points, you can't get any more dice you have what you have at that point.

This very likely could wind up a 10 in the near future.

Fun game for solo play. Bonus points for being the perfect length for a medium-light strategy game. This game has a lot of replayability since you only use a fraction of available tiles each game. For example, some games you'll have little use for military dice since few conquest nations appear.
Update: The Unrest expansion improves the solo gameplay in many areas. The Unrest dice and an element of risk to your dice rolls--a 1 in 6 chance of losing a turn or die each roll. Passing the rest of your round early can now give you a bonus, while waiting too long can make scoring goals harder. In the base game, Passing is meaningless. I raised my rating.

Amazing, well not, Vasel loved the thing, even if, he throws out the theme as oil on water. Hey, it has dices so theme is just a moot point. He should remember this when reviewing Feld's games like Aquashere.

The more I watch Dice Towers the more I slowly dislike it. I don't mind someone disliking a game, but I do mind when that criticism isn't applied appropriate apparently arcoss the board, no pun intended.

Remind to self, may or may not want this, have been burned many times from a dice centric review from Dice Towers. Need to wait until if and when other reviewers post videos that I trust more.

Disclaimer: I've not played Nations. So my only experience is with this dice-based version on Yucata. As I tend to favor shorter games and I like playing with dice, this was naturally right up my alley. It's rather addictive.

In short, across four ages you roll your dice once and then use what you get to acquire tiles which help you in future turns. Maybe you get a re-roll token, or you get better dice (in one of 3 colors), or you acquire a wonder which you can build for victory points. The key is really in knowing the potential of each kind of die and maximizing those benefits.

There isn't a lot of depth here and luck is a strong factor, which is the only reason I don't rate the game higher. It is otherwise quick and pleasant fun that likely will make people want to play it again immediately. This is one I know I'll have to add to my collection soon.

A great little game that plays relatively quick with tough decisions. It uses many concepts of its big brother, but it plays in half an hour. Civilization building with dice at its best.

I think this game does a decent job at pretending to give players options. But it doesn't. It may make them think they are making decisions. But in reality, the moves are always straight-forward and based entirely on the best allocation of your random die rolls.

The art is nothing to rave about. The decisions are obvious. The dice look nice. But again, this doesn't feel like a civilization game. And it doesn't feel like there's any interesting strategy.

Like with Pandemic, what is this fad of making "the dice game" games?

Feels as if there's 2/3 of a great game here. My plays were much better than expected (I'm not a fan of Nations at all). Felt like it was designed with more going on but they removed some of it to put in an expansion.

1-4 players that takes 10-15 minutes per player and shares many concepts with the civilization-building game Nations while still offering its own challenges. The game is played over four ages (four rounds). During each round, players take turns until all have passed. The available actions are:
Buy a tile
Build a wonder
Reroll some or all your dice
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros: Shorter than Nations. Has dice.

Cons: Has dice, your plans can be disrupted by unhelpful dice rolls and rerolls are few. Trades length and setup time for a much smaller decision space to the point of filler level.

Great dice roller that squeezes four resource engines (War, Famine, Technology and Wonders) into four types of dice. War is strong as it determines player order, which breaks ties during endgame scoring, and the appropriately-named Advisors (i.e. re-rolls) are critical for balancing probability in a tightly-tuned dice pool.

Pleasant port of Nations to a dice game.  It retains the feel of the original game, plays quickly, looks good ... basically ticks all the boxes.  The ability to roll and use newly upgraded dice is a nice touch, allowing for some combo potential.  After three games it is already beginning to feel a bit stale, leading me to think it will have a short stay in the collection.

Enjoyable game, but it didn't grab me like I thought it would from Rahdo's review. No urge to get it back to the table, so I traded it away. Maybe the expansion would have helped, but I don't like to throw more money at a game if the base game couldn't keep my interest on its own.

Too simplified. Every age feels the same. Theme feel pasted on. Straight Euro - the dice is only used to determine the resource type. Afterwards, everything is no different than pushing cubes around, although in this case, the post rolled dice. The original Nations was great - it was a Euro that decently applied the theme to the game.

2014-11-11 : Civ building game that feels just that tiny bit too light to be a good game. Well-designed but it lacks a bit of meat on the bones, a bit of depth. Will play this again to see if the initial impression improves.
2014-11-15 : Second and third play showed that while the game is light, there are multiple paths to victory. The last game ended with a 3-way tie and the 4th player just 3 points behind and we all did different things. Plays in an hour so even if you have the worst luck possible, it's over soon.

This game exactly met my demands.
You don't have 6hours in front of you to play at through the ages or nations but you still want to play a civilisation game ?
Nations the dice game is for you !
I agree the dice part brings a lot of chance.
But you still can play the odds since the dice repartition is known.
It is up to you to build your dice pool according to your ambition.
And even if some bad dice rolls disturb your plan, plays don't last long enough not to take your revanche on both chance and your adversary !

In French :
Ce jeu correspond parfaitement Ã  mes attentes.
Vous n'avez pas 6 heures devant vous pour jouer Ã  Through the ages ou Nations mais vous voulez tout de mÃªme avoir la sensation de construire votre civilisation Ã  travers les Ã¢ges ?
Nations : le jeu de dÃ©s est fait pour vous !
Je suis d'accord, les dÃ©s amÃ¨ne leur part de hasard.
Mais Vous pouvez toujours jouer sur les probabilitÃ©s de tirage puisque la rÃ©partitions des dÃ©s est connue.
A vous de construire votre stock de dÃ©s pour correspondre Ã  vos ambitions.
De plus, mÃªme si de mauvais jets de dÃ©s contrecarrent vos plans, la partie ne dure pas trop longtemps pour vous permettre de prendre votre revanche Ã  la fois sur le hasard et sur votre adversaire !

Very fun, steamlined and fast dice game. The civ theme is barely there, but there are always interesting decisions to make and there is some depth to gameplay. Even though you cannot attack each other, it still feels interactive because you compete for tiles and books.

To me, this is better than [thing=126042]Nations[/thing] because it manages to capture most of the central elements and feel of the game while remaining considerably shorter. Also, the dice game is a great way to introduce its big brother.

I actually prefer this one to its parent.

It's interesting how streamlined the game is; most die faces are good for exactly one thing (stone for building wonders, books for culture, gold for many tile costs, food for end-of-round famine -- only swords seemed to be used for more than one thing).

Little things like how events can only gain you points if you meet criteria instead of losing points of you don't meet them have the same end result as Nations, but it just feels friendlier.

There are many interesting decisions during a round -- do you risk a re-roll now knowing that opponents may take your favorite tile?  Turn in a chit early to grab a tile sooner?  Trade in two bad dice for a gold to nab that second-row tile?

Wonders require a lot of rock to get done, so you definitely want blue dice for them.  Books can be a good source of points every turn particularly at higher player counts, but staying high on the track eats a lot of dice.  The war and famine are also good sources of points, but they can tie up a lot of dice.  War has the advantage that the swords are also used for player order, which can be important for nabbing the best tile on the next round.

A super quick resource-converting, civ-themed game with a nice mix of custom dice. There's nothing memorable about any of the uniquely named tiles since they all share very similar awards, but the multiple dice pools that you build upon do offer some interesting choices throughout the game.

Very fast game with Nations-theme, but not that well connect to the base game.
Sure can be amazingly swingy with the dice and turnorder when a new era begins mattering so much. But it is so fast that you can almost live with it.
Fun little game. Don't be scared of the name.
Will probably get stale quick though.

When I read the user comments by high raters, I find myself in disagreement. In case your tastes are anything like mine, you should be aware of the dissent! :)

:star: Very simple ruleset. Short play time.
:star: Fairly simple decision set, but fun enough tension for a light dice game.
:nostar: It is a [i]fairly light[/i] dice game. Not much more than that.
:nostar: It is a very expensive, fairly light dice game.
:nostar: Buildings and gameplay are virtually themeless. This gives you blue dice, but that also gives you blue dice. This gives you three points, and that gives you three points.
:nostar: None of the tiles are truly unique. I.e. the effects of one tile (say, a province, or a technology) is identical to some other tile (province or technology).
:nostar: This is a pure euro game with a side of point-salad. If you like that, you will like this.

Erfolgreiche Spiele zu einer WÃ¼rfelausgabe zu schrumpfen gehÃ¶rt zur Moderne des Brettspiels. Von diesem Marketingschicksal bleibt auch das beste CIV-Euro der Welt nicht verschont: NATIONS goes NATIONS THE DICE GAME. Dabei sollte man nicht den Fehler machen NATIONS THE DICE GAME mit dem Mutterschiff zu vergleichen, denn diesen Vergleich kann es natÃ¼rlich nicht standhalten. Zum einen, weil die WÃ¼rfel mit einer geradezu brechenden GlÃ¼ckskomponente das Aufbauspiel des Ausgangspiels kontern, zum andern weil es dadurch auch einer ganz anderen Gattung zuzuordnen ist: WÃ¼rfelspieldaptionen und andere mittelleichte Stundenspiele. Und innerhalb dieses Segments kann NTDG gefÃ¤llig bestehen ohne dass es einen Orgasmus bekommt. MÃ¶glicherweise kÃ¶nnte der umgekehrte Weg interessant sein und Spielern Ã¼ber NTDG BrÃ¼cke und KrÃ¼cke zu NATIONS sein, die vor NATIONS bisher zu wuchtig fanden. In diesem Sinne freut sich der Rezensent Ã¼ber ein Gratisexemplar und sagt herzlich Danke.

Addictive.  Just ok solo - falls a little flat.  Great multiplayer though.  Quick to set up, quick to play, quick to put away - and a lot of fun packed into that small time slot.  Lots of dice chucking and plenty of decisions too.

Looking forward to the expansion.  Asymmetrical starting roles, and more dice!

I had originally wanted the original big game and had ordered it from Amazon. Sent it back the first time as the box was dinged up. Sent it back the second time and cancelled my order because the insert was broken. I don't like the size of the original game box anyway. All that space and nothing there. At least the Dice game is a smaller reasonable box.

COMPONENTS: Tiles are great. Chits are OK. Game board, player board, score board are all pretty thin. They didn't lay flat and I had to sort of bend them around a bit to get them to stop standing up. 

RULE BOOK: Didn't seem so clear at first and took a bit to get my head around what they were describing. First learning game I bailed out because I messed up the rules on advancing victory points by accidentally gaining new chits. Too much yellow on icons got me confused till I took a closer look. I was tired though.

AFTER 6 PLAYS:
- Game sets up fast
- Game plays fast
- Each game is nicely randomized
- I like the way you use dice 
- It's a great solo game

Very pleasent little dice game. The theme is harmelss, the graphics are too.
Has some reminescents of CV from Filip MiÅuÅski, and the latter seemed a little bit more open, though more overhelming too.

Nevertheless - if I had to peek one game with buy dice with dics, I'd rather choose Roll for the Galaxy.

I liked the slight engine building feel, but in the end, it has similar issues to other dice games. If you don't roll coins or swords matching the display on the first turn, your engine building will be slim compared to others. The turn order penalty on turn 1 can be significant, as the cost to acquire advances goes from 1 to 2 to 3, and the first buyer typically gets a free reroll of their spent die or dice --not well thought out IMO. If you match the display (or you've started wonders and get the correct stone dice), your engine gives you an advantage, and that advantage persists for the remaining rounds.

There are alternate ways to get VPs with books, war and famine, so there are meaningful decisions to the game. Also, the actual play time is pretty short. Set-up is not so short due to sorting the tiles, but not onerous either.

I think I'd probably put this behind To Court the King, and Roll Through the Ages, in terms of dice games. To Court the King you might fall behind, but you can always get a bit lucky in the final roll, so there's some interest there. Coincidentally, Nations uses a nearly identical mechanic as to Court the King but uses tokens instead of characters that bring in a die of the appropriate number (in Nations, this doesn't get you a free reroll however).

If you like dice games, I'd give it a try --not a bad game by any stretch. If you tend to get frustrated with them, I'm not sure this gives you enough options to win you over.

I waited so long for this game to be available and now that it hit the table I was underwhelmed. There are only 4 ages (rounds) that means you roll your dice only four times in the game (optionally you can reroll bad results) but that's it.  It's just too short to build up a nation (engine).  And there are too few tiles to offer enough variety for repeated plays.  The concept of the game is good but they blowed it by dumbing it too much down.  What a pity.  And don't ask me if I like the artwork (Meh).
This game really needs an expansion to get worthwile.

Version en juego de dados del "nations". juego de progresiÃ³n de civilizaciones con cierta perspectiva historica. 

En esta version queda un "semi-filler" (la partida completa alarga mas o menos, una hora). agradable de jugar, aunque no es un juego que destaque en ningun apartado.

Luck mitigated somewhat by the dice and tiles you buy. Food underpowered and almost a worthless roll sometimes. Doesn't quite feel "balanced" in the right way, or something.

RATING: 7
A nice game that plays quickly (15 minutes per player is very realistic) and has a good sense of mechanical progression even though the number of parts to the game is pretty small. Player order is extremely important, especially in higher player-count games. Tiles aren't as differentiated from one another quite as much as I would like. The designer has hinted that there might be an expansion being developed - if that is true I'd be very interested as "more" might help push this game up a bit.

If Nations (the board game) is on one side of the scale in terms of length and weight, Nations: The Dice Game is near the other end. My preference would have been for it to be somewhere in the middle between the two. I'm not sure it provides me an experience I am looking for but I will give it a few more plays. It may be a good way to introduce some very basic mechanisms of Nations to new players, but it still is quite light.

Initial impression: very fast playing, rules are clear and clean, really like it.  

Reminds me a lot of 7 wonders, although you don't have the path to follow you do with 7 wonders, which also means you can't guess what your opponent is trying to get.  So a more dicey, less-interactive version of 7 Wonders Duel.

I found almost nothing fun inside this box whatsoever, unfortunately.  The art style is poor, production is nasty and the game simply isn't exciting.

It's difficult to describe all the individual things I disliked about it, just that the whole experience was boring and provided almost no opportunities for meaningful decisions.  I know this is a light-hearted dice chucker, but there are better ones out there.  Well below-average in my opinion.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2017)

Nations is an ok game for me but I have always preferred Through the Ages, a very superior game in my book, due to this, I never want to play Nations so my desire to play Nations: The Dice Game wasnât that high in the first place.

The game is a lot simpler than I expected. Rules wise it is very easy to teach. You can do it under 6 minutes. Playtime is under an hour.

The decisions needed to play the game arenât very complex, but they arenât that obvious either. You have only 3 decisions to make each time it is your turn (should I buy a new tile, should I re roll some of my dice? or should I buy a wonder?), also you need to choose which dice you are going to leave to the end of the round. There is a lot of luck with the dice, but there are ways to mitigate it, besides you know the odds of each dice so I feel the luck factor isnât uncontrollable, but it isnât low either.

Nations: The Dice Game shares some concepts with its parent game but it feels and plays very differently. I think I prefer this version of the game.

Bottom line, I like Nations: The Dice Game. It is an ok game to play from time to time. It can perhaps get an upgraded rating from me with more plays. Much better than regular Nations for me.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 8
This is a great game for an evening when we need a quick game.  It gives the feel of the civ-building and tableau of Nations in a fast-paced dice game.  But I love how the dice become less limiting as you purchase more buildings, etc.  How can I make the most out of these few actions and limited resources?  It feels puzzle-y and frustrating in just the right way.  And in a 2-player game, it is interesting to see what tiles come out (or rather, don't come out), which can really change the game.

Own Unrest, love the variety it adds.

RATING: 5
Played Oct 2014

This is a super light dice game. There isn't much going on at all, as far as decisions go. One novel thing about the game is that when you upgrade a building (buildings give you dice) you gain the new die, rolling it into your active pool, and lose a die which can be taken from your spent dice. So you can buy yourself into more actions/options on a turn. However, this stops happening in the last age, none of the buildings give you dice :(

-------------------------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 2014

It's hard to tell from the photos but I have hope that Nations may actually fit in the box for Nations: The Dice Game
Players start the game with white dice which show a bit of everything. Through 4 ages players buy new tiles to improve their die pools and earn VP. There are dice that specialize in coins/food, swords/food, and stone/books. Book scoring is the same as in Nations. There is also still a famine and war, although it is simplified here. For each you have to spend some number of food or swords, respectively, to get VPs equal to the current age. The other use for your dice is to buy buildings, colonies, leaders, and wonders. These can give you new dice and also chits which provide re-rolls or a once per round resource. Buildings and leaders must replace ones you currently own, but you can have unlimited colonies and wonders (although only one wonder under construction).

I'm not convinced there is much to this game. It seems pretty straightforward. If the game played in 30 minutes this would be fine, but they suggest 10-15 minutes per player. So perhaps this is too little game in too much time. In terms of dice games Dice Brewing and RTtA: Iron Age are both higher on my list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A surprisingly thematic reimplementation of Nations as a short dice game. It succeeds perfectly in taking the theme, porting the gameplay, reducing complexity and length while still posing an interesting challenge. As in Nations, turn order is decisive, potentially even more than in the big brother. The strategy is condensed, providing less alternatives which is fine for a 30 minute game. My one concern is that a player can be screwed by unlucky card distributions and turn order by turn 2 of 4 with nothing to do against it as thereâs a noticeable economic snowball at work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An uninspired dice game of a more tolerable larger game. I am totally unimpressed by the boring usage of dice as everything. You need to roll money to buy anything. In the later rounds you'll look at your dice and have no choice but to pass, as what you've rolled is totally unhelpful. It's  one of the worst "I rolled better so I won" experiences I can remember. Hard pass.

07-28-2015 - This might kill Nations for me.  This game is so quick, simple, elegant, but still captures the civ feel really well.  I'm not sure I'm into the limited options you get with the dice you roll, certain dice really only do one thing, and if you don't want to do "that thing" the dice are kind of worthless.  I don't know, it ate at me as the game went on.  But it was my first (and only so far) play and I'm sure there's more to it than met the eye.  Solid 9 for now, perhaps it'll go up or down.

A way better than the boardgame AND shorter. But the issue here is, that it's always no-brainer action to take more and better dice when possible, which makes early rounds always the same. Good thing though, that all the tiles aren't available in every game but still the issue is there. Some punisment or upkeep for the dice should be included OR some tiles which you can get using only basic dice or something like that. For what it is now, I don't have any reason to buy it, because after couple of games played I've seen enough.

Better than Nations - at least it has dice and it is way shorter. Still the theme just does not come through. For example, end of the round, feeding and war - why are these simply boring number conversions? E.g. for feeding the number of your dice should be taken into consideration, or war could be at least a 7 Wonders-like competition between nations... No, it's just a dice roller where you try to score in a few somewhat different ways. I prefer playing this one over Nations but I don't really want to play Nations again.
Roll for the Galaxy is 10 times better than this, sorry.

RATING: 5
After my third play, I'm dropping my rating from a 7 to a 6 already. There just isn't enough variety in the tiles to keep the game play interesting. Having played and enjoyed the original board game where diversity is high and each game plays very differently, this doesn't come close to matching that experience. 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Enjoyed my first ocuple plays despite losing badly once when I couldn't get a die face to change despite high odds on 3 different rerolls. Such are the vagaries of dice. Maintains the feel of the original boardgame while playing in 20-30 minutes. There are some solid decision points in the game although I think forgoing the points from famine and war should be done sparingly. My main concern is replay value as there are only so many tiles and they start feeling a bit samey. This will likely need an expansion to keep the game feeling fresh. Solid filler material and I appreciate that this doesn't use the yahtzee mechanic. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 5
Nations, the actual game, continues to baffle me. Some sessions go pretty well, some sessions are just a nightmare. My belief that I'd finally found a civ game where one player couldn't dictate how the other players were going to play the game seems to be erroneous. Without some house rules, it seems like it's just another "armies-with-grain" game most of the time. 

Nevertheless, I was curious about the dice version. I theoretically like dice games, except I often don't, so it was worth trying out.

The dice game is feather light and relatively innocuous. Two criteria that I look at for a dice game are: 1) does it matter that there are other people playing? and 2) to what extent do the dice get de-randomized, defeating the point of a dice game? Thankfully, Nations TDG passes both of those tests. You will get angry at the other players for messing you up, and you will get frustrated with your dice. That's good. Both of those things should happen in a dice game.

The board game has been simplified for this outing, but almost too much so. There's very little differentiating tiles from one another. For a four-player game, each era you'll use all but three of the tiles, so there isn't much variety there. The event tiles are unremarkably different in each era as well. I played three games of this and though they unfolded slightly differently each time, there wasn't that much to tell them apart. 

We'll see about Nations TDG. There's nothing wrong with it, and I certainly prefer it to Roll Through the Ages, but as dice games go it's not really standing out. I'd really rather play Ra: the Dice Game.

This one pretty much defines 'average dice game' because while it isn't bad, there is zero reason for me to play it again. It's nothing special and nothing memorable, just bland. VivaJava Dice and Roll for the Galaxy are both ones I would pick ahead of this. I also suspect that the mechanism for turn order is wonky, especially as turn order is the tie-breaker for end-game scoring!

Oh, and the art is naff - Marie Antoinette looks boss-eyed.

RATING: 5
Update: Much improved by the Unrest expansion.

I was intrigued by this after my first game, but then I played a multiplayer game solo to get the rules down and a 2-player with my son, and the game crashed to a 5. I know this is not a civ game but I still find it too limited. The decisions are not very interesting and play order can be very important. In theory itÂ´s a good idea to make players decide if they want to reroll the dice or actually do something, but in practice it can be more annoying than agonizing. Will play again if someone really wants to.

I've never played Nations, so I cannot compare the two games, but I really enjoy this game. It's very straight forward both as a competitive game and as a solo game. You are managing your dice trying to make the most use out of them as well as gaining the most points possible. Neat stuff.

I've now played this game three times (2-player games) and my initial thoughts are that it is a solid game yet there is quite big element of luck included how the tiles are put into the board AND who is able to go first. 

I've yet to play the game with 3 and 4-players but all and all I like it. Its light yet it has decent level of strategy in it. 

Maybe it is even better with more players. That remains to be seen. I'll update the score then.

Not a bad distillation of [gameid=126042]. I like that you can upgrade different dice (everyone starts with 5 white dice but there are also orange, blue and red dice each with different specialities). There didn't seem to be much decision making though and turn-order is really super-important so it's tough if the first player can purchase red dice (which contain attack, a stat that provides points, is used as a currency AND determines turn-order). Lastly, while the Civ theme works, it feels like it needs some extra tiles to give it more flavor and perhaps one more round as it ends just when you're getting your engine/personality going.

RATING: 7
While they have done a good job of balancing out the points and providing the right compensation based on start order so that any player can win, they unfortunately have not distributed the fun equally. Those earlier in the turn order are much more likely to be able to purchase tiles that gain them extra dice which they then get to roll and can make more decisions. Those coming later in turn order often have little or no choice and are more likely to need to pass out of a round early while the rest of the players get to keep doing stuff, quite boring.

New note - 24 Jun 2016 - Above still holds but the game has grown on me. As long as you can get some extra dice early you should have some descisions to make.

I have to say, what a great Dice implementation of a game...

Some good and interesting decisions to be made that keep the players engaged...
A game that plays fast (4 players can be done in 30 minutes!) like any good dice game should do...

My only two "complaints" about the game are:

1- Not that many tiles to be drawn, in a 4 player game there are 3 tiles in each era that don't enter the game... could use a bit more variety

2- There should be a "B"-side to the Nations Board, like in the Nations game, in that all Nations would have a slightly different starting dice (a different power that defines that Nation Characteristic) for more advanced play.

Other than that a great game there

EDIT:
The expansions resolves some of the issues I had with the game and for me it's a must have!

This game tries to boil the gameplay of its parent game down into around an hour for 4 players. Unfortunately it also replaces all the strategy with randomness. There is a perception of strategic options are quickly dismissed with the dice rolls.
Roll through the Ages does this theme and mechanics far better and in a shorter time, which is how a game with this level of randomness should play.
I would much prefer to spend an extra two hours and play the original!

good and fun game, rules are simple and straightforward so it's easy and quick to explain, while offering some nice decisions.


Final rating: 3, game is flawed.
Having to start the game from the last position (in 3p and 4p games) is very frustrating. In in our experience it's nearly impossible to play a decent game from that position and have any chance at winning. Actually, we've not seen any wins from that position at all, most of the time that player comes in dead last.

Much like the board game, during your your turn, you may buy tiles from three levels, but you use dice to pay for resources. You can use rerolls and at the end of each round each player checks books, swords and food to earn VPs. Game ends after four rounds. 

It is much shorter than the origial board game which I like. It's got a fresh look to it and after one game, I look forward to exploring the strategies. Rating may rise after more plays.

I got the impression that the game ended too soon. You build up during the first 3 eras and the fourth one is a bit dissapointing, because you don't get to do a lot of things with what you built. It's more a matter of netting as most of the bonus points from eras 3 and 4 as possible. I can understand why there are no more eras: the snowball effect would be bigger.

The game feels long, even if it's around the 30 minutes mark, because you get to do very few things.

Overall, I think there are much better options, where you get to do many more things in the same time. I can't help thinking about Roll for the Galaxy here.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A few years later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I recently played this at my game group and really enjoyed it, it is lighter and quicker than Roll for the Galaxy so that probably wasn't a fair comparison. With the addition of the expansion I think the replayability will greatly increase.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]Nations: TDG was a completely forgettable experience. Playing both this and Roll for the Galaxy I can't imagine ever wanting to play Nations: TDG. The decision space was very limited and strategies were all very similar with minor tweaks, definitely not a game I'm seeking out to play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I had a chance to play this tonight and found it to be a rather mediocre experience. I'll echo everyone else, how can you not have different starting civ powers?! I can't imagine this game would have gotten any of the buzz it's had if it wasn't thematically tied to Nations, but really the theme has been completely wasted. I also can't see this game standing up to repeated play, the decision space is too restricted. I am glad I got to play though because I love dice games and may have purchased it blind.[/i]

Loved my first game, liked my second, liked my third a little less. I suspect there is limited replay value here as the tile complement is too limited. There are a couple ways to win but books seem not overly viable as a primary strategy. This means that you tend to do the same things each game - get more dice, get the wonders and colonies you can, lather rinse repeat. 

Still happy to play it but I wish the variety was punched up a little.

"Clever civ-themed light-medium dice game, which looks like Nations, but doesn't really play like it. Unfortunately, the majority-based knowledge track ruins the game for me."

What I like:
- Quick
- Solo game is decent
- Clever mechanisms which feel fresh
- Civ theme (although it is quite thin)

What I don't like:
- The majority-based knowledge track (see below)
- Military is quite underpowered in the solo variant
- Military is underpowered in the final age 
- The book and stone icons are WAY too similar!
- Buildings aren't variable enough

I'm not a fan of majority-based scoring in general. The knowledge track here is bad, because you almost have to commit to it, but if you do, it's a blind bid of sorts, and you might waste a lot of effort (especially solo or 2p). But the worst part is that if you choose NOT to go with knowledge, you will still end up rolling some books. 

Unless you also forgo stone, but if you do that, then you are trying to win the game with gold/food, or with military. And the military is underpowered in the solo game, as well as in the final age at all player counts. 

I agree with the 2.0 BGG-voted weight.

This is a fun, distilled version of Nation that I can play in 30 - 45 min. It has a lot of the same feel as its big brother and adds in some fun dice rolling.

This game would be a solid 8 rating from me if the two player game were better. The culture track is just a little two swingy in a two player game. I have seen too many games simply decided by who started out ahead on that track.

This is, of course, simpler and faster than the original (Nations) as dicegames always are. But since the original competes with a much better and more player controlled game: Through the Ages, and this is more a game of its own, it's more to my liking than the original. 

This comment is after first try. 

I like the basic mechanics with a kind of deckbuilding with dice, but scoring seems a bit tilted. I felt the entire game I was behind, I had less dice, less important "buildings" than my opponents, I had no leader for the first half of the game, and I had a unbalanced setup of dice, but I still won because I got a lot of books from the beginning and won every scoring of books but the last.

This is quite the interesting title. Initially when I first read about it, I was hyped. A dice civ game? I'm in! After letting it sit in the back burner, I completely forgot about it and lost interest when it was being released. A buddy picked this title up, I played it and was wowed by it.

Now, after over a dozen plays of it, I can say it's a very quick, solid and fun dice game. Is it amazing? No. But what can you expect from a ~10 min per player game. It feels like a light version of it's bigger brother and maybe to a fault. I found it mimics a lot from Nations and yet could probably have benefited from a re-imagining of it's mechanics. I'd like to see an expansion for this game as I think it would take it from good to great. Hopefully while still retaining the short time frame that keeps this game in filler rotation.

When I first stumbled on the game here in bgg, I thought this was another dice version of a big game that is neither really connected to the main game or interesting, but then I read all the designer diaries and became interested. Having played it now I have to say it is even more deep than I thought it could be. Very nice strategic dice roller and has quite a bit of the same civilization building feeling as the big game does while taking only 30 minutes.

Felt like: 'we have a popular board game, let's make a dice version that will sell as it has 'Nations' in the name'. 
Not that it is a bad game, but if the dice don't roll what you need, you're screwed (like in most dice games). Luckily the playing time is indeed at most 30 minutes, so that's ideal for this kind of games.

RATING: 7.5
much better than Nations (or any other "dice" game)

Quite good, with reasonably interesting and tough decisions to make... at least for a filler game. Obviously, the game is pretty random as it is a dice game, but it still feels pretty strategic. Would have been nice if the tiles were less generic and more unique. More tiles would also improve the replayability. I think it's probably best with 4 players?

This game replaces completely his big brother Nations simply because it is shorter, more fun and gives about the same gameplay feeling as in the original Nations. 

Superb dice game that is probably the best of his genre by far, outclassing games like Roll through the ages or Roll for the galaxy.

It plays quickly, has very nice depth for such easy & simple rules. This is the definition of a great game !

Real Gem !!

I have never played Nations because I fear it is too heavy and too long for my tastes but this dice version was quite excellent. It didn't have any novel mechanics or anything we haven't seen before in other games, but it gives a sense of satisfaction to build up your civilization from the ground up in 30 minutes. Yes, there will be some unlucky rolls, but for a short game with only 4 rounds, it's not too big of a problem. The first couple of rounds are when players typically try to acquire more dice and also get more resources by discarding used dice for new dice. The last couple of rounds is typically when players rush for building wonders and gaining VP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In the Dice Game version, all the worker placement and economic growth is shifted into dice, your civ is upgraded to give you different/more dice, and the whole experience is shortened and simplified, playing out in about four rounds or so, ending with whoever has the most VP wins.

Overall, I really love how quick and clear the game moves, as opposed to the slightly tedious Nations, but my biggest objection is all of the changes made to do so. The use of dice makes it a slightly different game as you try and optimize your rolls (which you should recognize as a somewhat nonsensical statement), and build your civ to optimize your future dice and VP earnings. I love that it takes only forty minutes to play with four players, but I wish it involved more tactics in combination with strategy. Good, but not quite hooking me how I'd like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
More like a dice management game to mimic the boardgame. The look and feel is the same though you are basically just rolling dice in order to acquire wonders, acquire more dice, complete wonders etc. Can't build a civilization game juts by a bunch of dice. Strictly okay.

RATING: 6
A good way to reuse the Nations art work. has some of the feel of the original game, but little of the decision making. I like how it  distributes using the dice versus rerolls and allows for newly acquired dice to be rolled and used.

I am usually not a fan of dice games but Im all in on this one. I LOVE nations, so the theme here of a light civ style game is right up my alley. I know the dice can be random but its all about building your dice pool in a way that gives you the best chance at the direction you want to go in. One of my favorite things in this game is when you upgrade something you GET THE DICE IMMEDIATELY and roll them making them available to spend same turn. This is huge because it creates this great puzzle of trying to squeeze every little drop of possibilities out of your turn before passing. I waited and hesitated on picking this one up but boy am I glad I did. Great fun and plays in like 20 minutes with 2 players. 


:edit: after a few games I have seen some problems arise. Not purchasing the right tiles in the early rounds can leave you stranded late in the game. It may not be fun if a new player accidentally falls into that.

As far as dice gamea go, I like the style and pace of this one. I am perhaps one of the few that doesn't think this feels much like the original Nations game. This uses similar themes, but is a much less robust game. I miss the original war track and I actually prefer the more deadly famines. Lastly, I am really not a fan of the player order book bonuses at the start of the game, as I don't think they balance out. Still, what could I expect from a dice game version? It is light, fast, and still has a fair amount of decisions. The hardest decision usually being when to use the coveted re-roll tokens.

Overall, I am happy to play Nations Dice whenever suggested, but I much prefer its older sibling.

RATING: 8
Dice driven is usually a pass for me.  This game has an interesting use of dice and allowed for mitigation of the luck.  There are some games where you'll just get unlucky and end up losing, but the few games I've played resulted in fairly tight scores - so it's probably not as "unlucky" as it feels.

I probably won't rate this game higher with more plays as it's just too random for my tastes.  I'd play it again though...it is a fun game.

RATING: 7
As far as solitaire puzzles are concerned this game is not a bad option, but a mere reading of the rule can foretell the turn order system as flawed... basically, players early in turn order can pick the tiles that allow ramping up an engine of sorts, while those later in turn order get whatever crumbs they can afford.

Sure, the compensation on the book track for picking last in era I has some merit, but even if this bags the players late in turn order some potentially easy points, this does not make the game more interesting for them.

So rating for solo/2p, roll a d6 and subtract to rating for my opinion of 3/4p

22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play with 2p.

Each turn, a special event-tile is flipped and the available tiles are brought out to buy. Then all players roll their dice and get back their used tokens.

Subsequently, all players take these dice and use them in an action-for-action manner to buy new dice, tiles (monuments, advisors, colonies). If you buy new monuments, you typically get rid of old dice in favor of stronger/more interesting dice that give you more specialized dice typically with stronger die-faces. The colonies give you more tokens, which lead you to mitigate the luck of the roll a little (you have tokens for all resources and for rerolls). At the end of each turn, you get points if you have enough unused food to face famine, unused swords to face 'war' and books for a knowledge track. Then the player with the most books gets 1 or 2 points depending on player number. 

I was really impressed with this dice game.

Only played solo on Tabletopia.  Light dice builder - I don't see any reason to play this over Roll through the Ages, which has more direct player interaction and more strategic choices in which developments to purchase, whereas Nations your strategic path is mostly dictated by which tiles come out at which prices.  Although I like that players have their own dice and take turns using them, I prefer the Yahtzee mechanic of roll 3 times and that what you got, take your turn fast; or simultaneous action selection a la Roll for the Galaxy.

I heard a lot of praise for this one, but it felt like it had a few big flaws related to turn order or the like (it's been a while since I played before commenting).  If I'm going to play a dice game, I'd prefer it to be very strategic or very light, not somewhere in the middle.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Way too simplified version of the board game for my taste. What a shame because I was so looking forward to a simplified Nations dice chucked... just not this simplified. Leaders, colonies, buildings and wonders have all been given a generic spreadsheet valuation. Generic, generic, generic. There's just not enough variation from game to game to hold my interest. After a couple of outings this has been explored and I'm just a bit bored. There's not even a B side for the different nations with variable setup.

It's a game that I'm comparing to Roll for the Galaxy and this one is definitely coming off second best. The pity is that it was so close to being a more family friendly dice roller with the better theme. If only they'd been a bit more imaginative with the tiles - maybe included a few more, or replaced the 12 event tiles with dice rolls and used that punch board space for some more buildings and leaders. Despite the less appealing theme and more convoluted rules Roll for the Galaxy has the variation to make it stick in the collection, while the Nations dice game is one that could have been a blast if the tiles had the same imagination as the cards do in the board game. The basic mechanics are fine - keep it simple - but use the components to bring the game alive. This one is barely breathing. Maybe an expansion?

What I do like about the game is that the player interaction is fairly high for a dice roller. You have the competition to get to tiles first. The books level and the swords affecting the all important turn order.

Many games in and the luck of the dice rolls appears to be overwhelming. There's no good just missed the goal path here like in Roll for the Galaxy. Here your dice are committed and sometimes five swords will see you miss your goal by one, get nothing and come in fourth, while six swords will bank you four points and the win. Re rolls are often a help, but because not all resources can be cashed in two dice for one a couple of crappy rolls will just see you out of it. Roll for the Galaxy is spared this flaw not just by being able to change dice but also because of the clever mechanism of unused dice staying in the cup (employment queue), whereas used dice go out of the cup for the next round (the unemployment queue). In Nations The Dice Game it's a rather hit it or missed affair.

All that said, the underlying game here is solid. With the right expansion adding some more variability between leaders, wonders and colonies I could see this rocketing up my ratings to a 9 or so. Strong potential.

Really enjoy this game solo. It is quick to set up and gives the feel of the actual game. With other players, it is pretty light and not very deep but is a solid filler. It is a nice entry civ builder type game and is easy to teach and explain. Would highly recommend. I gave it slightly under an 8 because there are times where I would turn down a play just because I may want to play something longer or more complex, but fits the slightly heavier filler role really well.

You roll dice to get arbitrary symbols that allow you to buy literally arbitrary stuff... and that's it. Seriously, there's a bunch of similar-looking multiple copies of tiles, and the only thing that differentiates them is whether they're placed in the cheap, middle or expensive row. Sucks to be you if you're first player yet 2 of the same tile showed up in the cheap row.

No civ feel at all, unlike Roll Through the Ages which at least gives it a shot through getting and feeding more dice. In fact, I'm sure there's a better theme out there for this. Greece led by Cleopatra and having Maoi statues is just jumping the shark.

It's over really quickly, which makes this bearable.

A quick 4-turn dice game that plays well solo.  Actions include buying tiles, building wonders, or re-rolling.

Enjoyable "okay" filler game, not great.

Light and fun, captures the essence of the full Nations game, but plays very quickly. Each turn, you're able to either buy a tile (which has a bit of a race/auction feel to it), build a wonder (which also is competitive, as you don't have much acess to stone), or re-roll your dice. The game builds quickly, and it was definitely fun to play.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 4er

Unlike most "... the dice game" games, this is NOT a Yahtzee variant. Instead, it's a very streamlined version of the big box game, using tiles  in place of cards. You still have the various classes of improvements (wonders, colonies, advisers, etc), but acquiring them is simpler, as are their powers. The game uses dice to generate your resources each turn; improved production is represented by improved dice (vs. more resources). As you cover the basic buildings, you lose the starting dice and replace them with better ones! The military/food events are still here, but simplified: everyone either meets the goal and gets a reward, or not -- no penalty for failure. 

It's all very clean and works quite well. Your buildings are pretty generic, though: you can cover any of them, rather than having to match building type (color) like you need to do in Nations. Advisers are, too: they merely give you reroll tokens. I also miss having different starting setups (no double-sided player mats here!). And it all seems a bit too simplified, with little tension between players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I used to be in the mindset that dice versions of games I like were not worth my time.  They are typically just watered down, simplified, versions of the full game and that is completely against my personal sensibilities.  When it comes to games bigger is better for me.  However I really loved Roll for the Galaxy and enjoyed Pandemic: The Cure as well and these games convinced me dice versions of games could be good.  I think I'm back where I started now after playing this boring game.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this game design-wise.  It is just a really boring, simple Yahtzee clone.  On a player's turn they roll a number of dice and using the symbols rolled and tokens they have they can buy tiles from a board which will give them new tokens, points, or different dice.  At the end of each round there is a scoring for number of book symbols rolled (or on tokens) then a scoring for having at least a certain number of food and sword symbols/tokens.

This goes on for four rounds and that's it.  It is super simple, I will give it that.  But there's nothing entertaining here so all you have is a simple boring mess.  I can't get non-gamers to play this because the artwork isn't eye-catching and the theme (which doesn't really pertain to the gameplay at all) isn't interesting.

If I want to play or get someone else to play a game like this I will reach for CV.  CV has very similar gameplay, dice rolling and collecting tokens to purchase new additions to your resume.  But the artwork is bright and fun and the theme is actually prevalent and makes sense.  I really think this game was just created to get people interested in buying the big box game (which is quite good).  It even says in the back of the rulebook "Like this? Try Nations: the board game."

Finally, there is a huge dearth of content in this game.  Only 15 tiles per age and 3 events per age.  I suppose since none of the tiles or events really do anything but give you different combinations of tokens, points, and dice or have different thresholds of food and swords there is no need for more but that just emphasizes my point.

Down and dirty dice game with a civ-building setting. NOT civ-building dice game. Allows for some smart choices, a few paths to victory and thankful ways to mitigate dice. Meaty filler, very abstracted and generic. Good as long as you don't go into it expecting distilled Nations.

Enjoy the dice, ease to teach and game length. I don't really like the art and with multiple plays it would be nice for there to be more tiles so it doesn't feel so samey.

Fun quick little dice game. The upgrading of dice is a really cool element. I also like that re-rolling your dice is your entire turn, there's no waiting for the person to process the new results. You process your results while other people take their turns.

RATING: 4
Tableau building where your resources are provided by dice.
The tableau building part is really average with uninteresting/obvious action. The dice rolling part is the real limiting factor for a game of this scope. Even rerolls and dice conversion barely saves this one.
There is some different avenue for scoring points (war, famine, wonders, etc.), but it all boils down to the timing and luckiness of your dice rolls.
Fun for what it is, but very limited interest in replaying it.

Neat idea for a civilization dice game. It works, but feels a bit lacking. Getting an early jump on bonus yellow dice seems to snowball the victor within the few 2 ages. Wish there were more "middle weight" dice that might help mitigate the strength of going full production and simply getting more than everyone else. Not a bad game at all, but nothing really special after playing it a few times.

Squeezes the big brother Nations game into such a nifty package, I can see this getting more time on the table. The dice version is more straight forward, easier to teach/learn and plays more quickly. 

This of course comes with the cost of some game play depth. For example, advisors aren't anything else than reroll generators now. 

The original Spiel 2014 release had some production problems and the dice came out a bit wobbly, but I'm glad to tell you that the new print has no such fault, and the dice are just fine.

An extremely watered down Nations experience, but still recognizable as Nations.  It's a decent game for a quick Nations fix, but it's quite luck oriented at times (many times) given that you are victim to your dice rolls, and sometimes you just don't get what you need.  Some people enjoy randomness.  I'm not one who does.  If this game took any longer, it would drop in rating for me quite a bit.  As it stands, it is quick enough that the luck and minimal strategy do not bother me so much.  Nonetheless, it's a notch below "good" according to my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
It's a dice game, don't expect this to be [thing=126042][/thing] in 60 minutes. But also don't expect this to be to Nations what [thing=37380][/thing] was to [thing=25613][/thing]. This and Nations certainly share some of the same DNA. It's one of the heavier, more complex dice games out there, but that's not saying much by itself as most of them are very light and easy.
This game lets you develop technologies similar to the way you do in Nations. But in this case you get dice for them. And the dice give you the resources you need to get books, build wonders get colonies and acquire new technologies. So the way it all works is a bit different, but you're trying to do the same things in similar manners. But simpler and much shorter. The one game will not replace the other, both deserve their own spot in your collection. I liked it and have ordered a copy.

This came highly recommended as a 2p, 'heavier' dice game (vs. out normal go-to Ra: the dice game. We did like it and it does provide us with a good playing experience for 2p but I can't say there was a lot of 'drama' around the rolling either. Keeping for now, but could easily be replaced by  a better game.

RATING: 5.8
It is certainly much faster than it's mother game; we played a 4 player game in 37 minutes. But it is somewhat lacking in interesting choices - all 4 players seemed to value the tiles in exactly the same order, so turn order was the major factor - that and the (in)ability to roll red dice to give weapons as an outcome. This feels as though it could really do with more of an arc, or at least more interesting tiles in the final round or perhaps also a fifth round. 

It's better than Nations in that there doesn't appear to be too much of a death spiral problem, but I don't think it was ever fun or engaging.

Reminds me of an advanced version of Roll Through the Ages. While a poor streak of luck could certainly ruin your chances of a high score, more than likely you should be able to mitigate luck with quality strategy. I also appreciate that this game seems to minimize the "Just Get More Dice" strategy that so quickly overpowers other dice games. Yes, you'll want to collect more dice, but it's almost unavoidable in this game, and therefore more about progression than limitation. I like it!

I really wanted to like this. It's simple, the dice are cool and the concept is good. The problem is that the designers did nothing to help the competitive balance. Those going earlier in turn order are going to get the best upgrade dice for the least money, and the rich-get-richer effect snowballs from there. It's a dice game, so I suppose if the fourth player has some incredibly lucky rolls they could hang in the running for a while ... but it's unlikely. Might work as a two-player game, but as a three- or four-player game the balance is too far off.

Interresting dice adaption of Nations, giving a nice feel of culture advancement. I like the tight game structure and fast play time. It is a good filler game to play after or in between meatier stuff and as a dice game, it is refreshing to see something not too close to yahtzee. The expansion turns the volume way up - the game becomes much deeper and actual different strategies show up, while not bogging down play by much (mainly the new round bonus tile is something that takes a moment, the rest more or less stays the same). Rating without the expansion is a full point lower, but I never play without anymore.

I like the core of this game, but find that this is very much "samey" with each play. What that really means is this game is screaming for expansions. Now that makes me kind of sad. It's a solid workable game that is alright for a filler once in awhile, but not something I'm going to run to often. 

[ImageId=554376]
The game plays perfectly fine and executable as a 2 player game being as there really is not a lot of interaction between players. It might actually play better as you get more choices of tiles being as it doesn't scale down any from 3 to 2 players.

REALLY enjoying this game!  This completely replaces Nations for me (which was too long for me to get it to the table). Gives me a similar feel to its big brother, but much, much faster.  Lots of fun, interesting decisions.  

Was initially concerned that it wouldn't differentiate itself from Roll Thru the Ages, but this game is nothing like RTTA and is more fun!    

Great game! Loving it!

Light and easy to teach filler but absolutely one of the best in the category. You have meaningful decisions and a feel of developing and specializing a nation. Not to be confused with anything heavy because this is not that. If you ask me this is almost as good as 7 Wonders scratching almost exactly the same itches in weight and playtime and they will likely take turns hitting the table. This is good as it gives a needed break to 7 Wonders as the number one casual game.

What a pleasant surprise! after rating "Nations" with a 5 i wasnt even sure i wanted to try this but luckily i did. What's so much better with respect to the original game? it's fast! and tense, and simple, ... and fast again. 4 turns fly away in an hour or so in 4 players. You can build your strategy by collecting different dice and going for different ways of collecting points. Nice, nice, nice! I could even raise my vote after next plays.

I liked my play of Nations: The Dice Game enough to (briefly) add it to my want-in-trade list, but it didnât last long enough for me to leave it there. Itâs alright, but in the end itâs nothing special: roll dice, get new tiles that let you gain dice or recurring resources, get more tiles, accrue some points, rinse and repeat. Iâll play it again because itâs nice and short, but I donât need to own it.

Never played Nations, way too long of a game. But Nations The Dice Game is Great! Fast, Fun and easy to play. Lots of re-playability. The only thing is the art work could have been a little better. The only other thing is I wish they had added was given each Nation a special ability. It would have the game some more spice. A must buy game for a short fun time. Plays equally for all count of players.

Smooth and rapid civ game which a little bit of luck,and a dollop of strategy.  Fairly satisfying, but a bit light.  The game is missing a certain depth that would really propel it into a thematic and satisfying experience.  Maybe one more dimension, including another set of coloured dice?  Maybe a cascading theme wherein matching an advisor to a wonder or country provides additional points?  I'm eagerly awaiting the expansion!

Civilization builder using dice for resources, culture, and military. A light, gateway that is able to give a taste of the full board game in less than an hour. Of course it isn't as satisfying and I still prefer the full game, but this is a better choice for us to play with the grand parents. Depending on the price point I would get this one for this reason.

needs an expansion to add to the limited variability of the base game.
Even more so than in roll for the galaxy in my mind. Still,the game impresses me just how quickly it plays out. Our last game wasn't gilted with one player getting an awful roll in the 1st roll like the previous game. On top of being last in the player order the game was a right-off for them. If both players get reasonable 1st/2nd round initial rolls, the improvement dice make it a tense game if everyone roughly gets an even shake. I like this game but really worry about replayability after 10 games?

Too simplistic and too short. Too little stuff to do on your turn. A good filler, but i wanted more. Moreover, it is very punishing for bad moves. It is very short, so if you do a bad move once, the whole game may be screwed and you can see this on age two maybe, but you will have to play another two ages knowing that you can't come back. There are ways to mitigate dice, but sometimes you can still be screwed by bad rolls and re-rolls. UPD: after playing it more over the years i'm upping my rating to 7 (was 6). Randomness is still there, but it is quick and fun most of the time (and kind of addicting).

Just didn't do it for me.  Roll some dice, hope you get what you need to buy a card to get more dice or books or some such.

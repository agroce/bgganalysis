GAME: Beowulf: The Legend
RANK: 1805
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is like Rodney Dangerfield, it doesn't get any respect. 

It has blind bidding, some risk management, a cool theme (despite being pretty transparent), and an ass-load of tension (from flipping the cards when taking risks). What's there not to like?

I don't know the legend of Beowulf. If I did maybe I would find this game interesting. Or maybe I wouldn't. For me, it's a typical Reiner Knizia design. Sharp, slick, clever, lots of tough decisions but ultimately, well soulless. Yes Beowulf is a good game, yes it will reward planning and good assessment of the risks involved and yes with repeated playings you will have a better appreciation of what's involved. It's just that it is nothing special. The theme is (yet again) pasted on and the mechanics are dry and repetitive. I'll happily play it again. I even want to play it again but I doubt I'd use my choice on a games night to pick it. Someone please give me a Play By Web implementation and I'll enjoy playing the odd game on there

Beowulf - The Bidding Continues! What do monster-slaying and incessant card-drawing have in common? Nothing! And the goal isn't even slaying monsters per se but finding out who will become Beowulf's best buddy. Blech. Knizia should have quit the epic-tale genre after LotR; this feels like a lazy imitation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A game that is less random than it appears and more fun than one might imagine given the topic. It's a card management game but with lots and lots of Reiner "difficult decisions" at every turn. It actually follows the theme pretty well and you do sort of feel that you are on a quest moving from episode to episode working your way towards the dragon confrontation. Plays fairly quickly but you can also play too quickly and underestimate the strategy and tactics required to play well.

Beowulf is a game that I wanted to like, but couldn't. The game seemed long for what it was. The linear aspect was not interesting,  I didn't really care about the decisions I made, and the game was not intuitive for me. I admit that I was very tired while playing this game, and realize that I probably should try it again... just not in the near future.

A wretched waste of time. The victor won completely by wildly good draws from the deck. My friends said there was strategy and I said, "but the winner was determined completely (I mean *completely*) by luck." There's no defense for this in my opinion. There might be some better game experience in there, but for now, I'm loathe to play it again. Too many definitely better games to play.

I think this underrated.  If you pay attention to your opponents card bids you can steer your strategy to win the later, more valuable episodes.  The 'risk' action and management of scratches adds even more depth.

RATING: 2
99 and 99/100% luck, plus the teeny tiny print on the board is practically invisible.  This was a pointless excursion to me -- I bailed 3/4 of the way to the end and let someone who was sitting it out finish for me so I could chat with a friend instead.  It's not that *every* game has to be about strategy for me -- heck, I love me some Cranium and Pictionary -- it's just that if I'm not going to be exercising my brain, I want to be laughing and amused or at least delighted by the chrome as in say, Niagra (which when it comes to tactics and strategy, is a 9 compared to this).

Another cool Knizia auction game. Proper planning and knowing when to quit is more important than luck. This is really a game where all players are involved at all time.

RATING: 4
This one didn't get me at all.  It felt like the randomness in the cards overshadowed most of the decisions.  In addition, there really isn't much of a catch-up mechanism since the only opportunities to remove scratches and wounds come at the expense of gaining a different benefit and/or spending gold.

The gameplay itself felt like it only had a tenuous connection to the story.  Could easily have used a different theme.  I did not feel like I was acting out the part of Beowulf.

In the game I played, I felt very much behind due to early scratches and wounds.  Surprisingly, I came in second-to-last.  I have no idea how I didn't come in last.  Too much of the outcome is random and players have very little control over their destiny.

Also gets minus points for a lack of Angelina Jolie.  (Yes, I know this one predates the movie.)

I suppose I could be talked into playing this one again.  Certainly not on my must play list and certainly not one I would choose.  Give it a try if you've got some time to kill.

A surprisingly quick-playing game with a variety of tough decisions and a completely pasted-on theme that somehow works. Great for two. A "lite", competitive version of Lord of the Rings in some ways. The only serious fault is the rules, which are too chatty (and therefore hard to learn confidently, or refer to to resolve questions) and make the game seem more complex than it is.

Played three times now, has gotten better every time.

Works much better when no one gets really lucky/unlucky, and the people who risk more actually get hurt more by it.  

I think it would be better if your chances on the risk were more like 50%, not 75%.  At 75%, it means that when you play a card from your hand, and others risk, they probably are still in and you just feel very annoyed.  At 50%, when you playa card from your hand andthey risk, youll probably get somewhere.

I feel it is underrated.

If you're familiar with the poem, "Beowulf", then the game is well themed. It also helps to have a good imagination: those who have none will not be inspired by this game.

"Beowulf: The Legend" is an excellent game of risk-management. It can certainly feel luck-dependent (and you can't win without some level of luck); but ultimately, it depends not on luck itself, but on how well you manage the risks you're taking: luck will never save you from poor risk-management!

I have two complaints: there are a few obscure sections in the rulebook, but that problem is solved with the very good examples given. Secondly, the icons on the board are too small, and they could have been bigger, given the amount of space that is available.

I can see why Beowulf is compared to Taj Mahal, another game of bidding with cards and careful hand management. In both games planning is essential; deciding which auctions you will contest and which to drop out of early.  Taj has the different ways of scoring, whereas Beowulf is really only about accumulating v.p.s while avoiding wounds (negative points),  Beowulf adds a push your luck element - the risks - which I don't think present very interesting decisions.  

The narrative path following the Beowulf story was a good thematic idea.  However, it is entirely negated by the auction mechanics; never did I feel like one of Beowulf's brave companions fighting monsters. While I wouldn't object to playing again, Beowulf just doesn't engage me, either thematically or in terms of the game play.

I playtested this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More bidding with card sets from Knizier, with the random risk-taking aspect to make it approachable for non-gamers, but to be fair I've found it less random than Lord of the Rings, for example. And still the whole course of the game is very tightly balanced - a clever design.

RATING: 6
A game that, for me, promised more than it delivered.  I felt the game was almost entirely luck driven.  There are some really interesting decisions but as the game is so heavily dependent on the cards that show up, it's entirely possible to fall far out of contention very early and have little control over whether or not you'll be able to get back into the game, regardless of your decisions.  When we played our first game as a group, it was clear after the first 20 minutes that two players were far ahead of the other two players.  More than an hour later the game ended, with the same situation.  The players who struggled really made few, if any, "mistakes" but just had no chance.  I'm not against luck-driven games, and the mechanic is somewhat interesting but I don't like games that pretend to not be luck-driven but are very much so.  I'd probably give it another try to see if I missed some subtleties of the game, as some people at the table really seemed to like it.

This title seems to me to have split the BGG vote more than any other recently. My take is it can be viewed and played as a family game (theme, playing time, luck, travelling along a single fixed path), or a gamer's game (planning several moves ahead, picking your battles, calculated risk, flexible strategy), or somewhere in-between. It seems the perception of where Beowulf lies on that scale is very subjective. I'm neither a lover nor hater, I'm just one of those who doesn't really know what to make of it. For me there are several other family games or gamer's games ahead of it.

RATING: 7.5
{3 plays • 3 & 5 players} The really cool thing about Knizia is how he manages to plumb the seemingly shallow pool of The Auction mechanic and still produce not only LOTS of variants on it, but genuinely interesting ones.  Beowulf doesn't feel like a bunch of auctions to me, even though it clearly is.  Maybe because all bids get spent or because there's some room for bluff and/or intimidation... maybe because the auctions get broken up by those other event spaces... or maybe it's just the addition of that *genius* "risk" mechanic.  I also think, that because your "bidding" cards/suits and not money, and because you essentially have a "road map" for all auctions, it's feels more like a resource/hand management game, with the auctions being secondary.  I'm one of the few people who enjoys Pizarro & Co, for example, but even still, that game really feels like it's just a lot of auctions.  But Knizia is, well... Knizia.  He's really good at finding that little nugget that makes games interesting, regardless of the basic mechanic.  And Beowulf is yet another example of this.  A lot of people compare this to his own Taj Mahal, because of the similar bidding mechanic, but my friend, Ryan Wheeler I think nailed the better comparison, and I quote, "I'd say it feels more like a version of Marco Polo Expedition that works really well. You want to be secure in your arrival at the different destinations. I never really liked MP as much as I wanted even though I saw some clever bits in there. Who knew that all that had to be done was to add some auctions and a violent theme and it would be almost perfect. :-)"

Initially, I didn't think much of it and was concerned about the risking.  I continued to think about the game, though, and eventually traded for it.  Many plays later I'm extremely glad that I did.  I find it relatively easy to teach, not unthematic, and very well-paced (especially with a game-driver).  I think it works equally well with 4P and 5P, and I'm not prone to say that.  Should probably see how it is with 3P or perhaps even 2P.  Especially surprised at how unrepetitive it feels despite the linear progression and similar auctions.  Most importantly, I think it's flat-out gamer fun.  One of my few true keepers.

RATING: 7
It is clear that the game's mechanics have roots in Knizia's Lord of the Rings.  The game is easy to teach and play.  Game play is really a series of mini - trick taking card games.  The rules for each mini-game vary from event to event as do the benefits (or penalties).  The board serves only as a guide indicating when each 'trick' round is played and when players can recover cards.  The key to play is hand management for upcoming events.  Overall a nice light - medium game.  Game mechanics and theme are completely independant.  [GTI Code: AGSL]

Rating after one play.  I heard Beowulf was similar to Taj Mahal and Lord of the Rings, and I can definitely see it.  The movement of Beowulf around the board and the competition for various rewards is well implemented.  

I really wish we had used a variant that made risking more dangerous, because, as one player put it, risks were "out of control."  Luck played much too large a role in deciding most, if not all, of the auctions.  I didn't expect another Taj Mahal, but I was hoping for at least some amount of tension.  A decent game that I would like to play again with two or three adjustments to the rules.

This will always be a favorite and I will never tire of it. The Risk element on card draws and during auction rounds makes this a lot of fun! Can't recommend this enough. For any group or family. The theme is so perfectly intergrated to the mechanics. This should get reprinted and properly enjoyed.

A nice bidding game with a lots of fun and great design. I am not sure about the replayability of it however... but I have also played it just once so far. :)

A mid-weight Knizia game in a big box.  An easy flowing bidding game, but with a significant element of luck ('risk') in the card draw.  First game, one of our three players lost heavily as a result of poor card draws, but all enjoyed the game and would be happy to play again.  Reminded me in feel of round the world in 80 days.  Second game, five players, one playing for first time overbid at beginning and there seemed to be no way back.  Unforgiving?

If the epic read like the game plays, scholars would have burned every reference to this story long ago.

RATING: 7
Elements of High Society (rewards and penalty auctions) & Taj Mahal combined with a fairly fresh take on risk management. Perhaps most easily described as push-your-luck Taj Mahal, which should make it slightly more palatable to non-gamers. Lady luck favors the bold in this game but long term planning is still necessary to win the game. Components are nice although I think the publisher should have skipped over the gimmicky 3/4 board in favor of a more traditional board as the font size and icons are too small for most people.

Meshing push-your-luck risk management (light weight) with an auction mechanic (medium weight) seems fairly innovative to me and it's done fairly well in my mind. The tough thing with push-your-luck games is that they tend to facilitate whining about *your* bad luck and so-and-so's incredibly good luck. So probably not for those who want a purely strategic or tactical game. I for one prefer the risk mechanic in this game to dice resolution in many other popular games (i.e. Settlers, WOTR).

Rated after one play.  It certainly has a press-your-luck feel not only against the deck when you take risks, but also against the other players through both simultaneous reveals and gradual one-upping of the previous person.  Easy to learn and I can see it being a rather quick game once everyone is acquainted with the rules and objectives.  I expect this rating to rise as I get more plays in.

RATING: 5
So far I have enjoyed playing this very random, push-your-luck "social" game!  Keep in mind that I usually dislike games that feature a heavy luck element.  Although the card draw and/or alliance tokens can heavily swing the game, I still find plenty of strategy in Beowulf.  I consider Beowulf to be a hybrid of Lord of the Rings and Taj Mahal.  Unfortunately, Beowulf has been largely overlooked.  Since Beowulf is basically a gambling game that rewards long term planning and l-u-c-k, I can see why it is not rated as highly.  We play with the Treasure auction.  We also play with the rule that any player with 3+ wounds at game end automatically loses.

Risking is all about counting cards and knowing when to Risk and when not to Risk... and of course getting extremely lucky!  For some reason I love this mechanic in Beowulf, but despise it in Goa!  Perhaps I should be more accepting of the colonist draws in Goa.

Someone asked me why I'd once commented that Beowulf had "Taj Mahalitis" and why that was a bad thing.  Well, it isn't a bad thing, since Taj Mahal is one of the more sought-after and very good Knizia games.  I believe that when it first came out, it also took a while to catch on.  Knizia games have a lot more going on than what meets the eye, and Beowulf is definitely of that genre.

Beowulf and Taj Mahal share a lot of common characteristics, such that Beowulf is not a Lord of the Rings mechanics sequel, but a bidding game of high pedigree.  The common track that you can plan out for ahead; the bidding with different icons; the set collection.

Taj Mahal has a lot more variety in terms of set collection and scoring, and special things you can do with particular sets, but all rounds have the same kind of auction, with different rewards per auction as you moved through India.  

Beowulf, on the other has a lot more variety in auction type and round actions, and keeps the same variety of rewards.  Both games have rewards that can be traded in for special cards, and victory points to collect (Taj Mahal had a bit more going on in set collection), but only Beowulf rewards you with a better variety of special cards.  

I really like the variety of rewards that Beowulf hands out to the first, second, third, etc. players to drop out of the auction.  There are times when you really want to come in *second*, since one of the sets you can collect can get you knocked out of the game if it's large enough (wounds).

Taj Mahal has a lot of plastic palaces to keep people happy, which you can play on a beautiful board.  Beowulf has a board that is both beautiful in its illustration and yet the auction path is not very pretty, even if it is functional.  I think I was expecting something with a lot more gilt and runes and Celtic knots and separate boards with more Beowulf art and so on, even though that would take up more room and production costs.

(Maybe someone can make pretty Beowulf boards to play over, one for each major story section.)

Preliminary Rating... Quick Two-Player... seems like a nice enough game... not too heavy... a nice way to pass the time with some push-your-luck stuff going on ("know when to hold-em know when to fold-em" and the like")... especially interested in trying th death variant (three or more wounds at the end and you're literally 'dead' in the scoring round, auto-loss for you... probably true that it lessens frivolous "risking").

Have played twice now, both times with 4 players, and enjoyed the experience very much. Moves quickly, different types of auctions keeps things interesting, and the bits are great for the most part.

I'm not a gaming genius - I like pushing my luck, playing from the gut, and using my head as best I can without making it hurt...and this game gives me what I like.

This game had not been on my radar at all, but man am I glad I picked this up. I always have a blast with this game. It's got the delicious tension of a Knizia auction game, with a narrative element to the planning and long term strategy. I think it's brilliant fun to look down the road knowing how the plot points of the narrative will play out, and using this knowledge to focus your strategy on when to bid more, when to bow out of an auction, and when to risk. The risks are a fun way to push your luck. Some people are burned by the random nature of it, but there is definite thinking and planning involved when it comes to whether it's a good idea to risk. There is definite skill to this game, and sure some degree of luck, too. But it all comes together in such fun!

Played once, had a good time. Maybe it's because my collection is mostly devoid of non-filler bidding games, but this was very different and a refreshing change of pace. Long term planning is important, and the multiple ways to score big points towards the end make for some epic bidding as the game approaches its conclusion. The 'Risk' mechanic is a lot of fun, adds immeasurably to the excitement factor.

A bad Knizia game.  Theme is worthless.  Mechanics are bidding oriented.  Overall the game is too repetative.  You bid on the same stuff over and over and over, just in different lots.

RATING: 5
I only picked up Beowulf due to a freak misadventure, but boy am I glad it happened.  This is a very fun game.  Risking always elicits groans and fist pumping.  Too much luck to really elevate it to classic status, but playing around it creates a very intriguing game.  I should qualify that, too much luck for its length, about an hour with 5 players.  The minor episodes also occupy more game time than the far more interesting major episodes.  Nevertheless, everyone enjoys it, a rarity among even my favorite games.

*Update*  Unlike others, I in fact must lower my rating after extensive interaction with Beowulf.  The game really teases you with hints of strategic depth, but after 10  plays (not an inconsiderate amount) I must finally admit that whatever strategy exists pales in comparison to the importance of the risk mechanic in determining a winner.  To prove my point I even tracked every player's risks in our last Beowulf game and a ranking of the risking percentages perfectly reflected the ending scores.  The corrupting influence of the risk mechanic stems from the complete dearth of cards that enter the game from other sources.  It wouldn't be nearly as important if the cards from risking didn't constitute such a huge portion of cards in the game.  I would say that 50% or more of the cards in the game come from risking and in a game almost completely about hand management, this constitutes a serious flaw.

This realization also makes me more keenly feel that the game's length likely needs a slight curtailing.  As a 45 minute game the obscene role of luck becomes slightly more palatable, but our games hover around about an hour.

Played this game tonight and enjoyed it.  But must admit it seemed like I was playing the Hobbit or LOTR on a different board.  I'm not sure I would buy another game by this author because he seems to use the same system but with different themes.

Still, however, I do like the game.  I find it a very light game, light on the rules.  I found the rules not written all that well initially.  But once we started to play we looked up the rule for the different event and was able to get through it ok.

Looking forward to more plays, will adjust rating after a few more plays.

Great game.  I see this as a combination of Knizia's Lord of the Rings and Taj Mahal, games which I think are tops in their categories.  In Beowulf, you use cards to overcome challanges, and while not cooperative, you travel a set path with other players similar to LOTR, but you also confront them directly via cardplay with the whole brinkmanship/poker aspect of Taj Mahal.  In fact, this game for me captures the elements that I like most about both those games, so much so that it may very well replace the two of them in my core collection.  Lots of tension, lots of incremental decisions, some luck but the choices you make directly control your fate, and the other players are always meddling with you or you with them.  One of our players was lukewarm on it, 2 liked it, but 2 of us thought this was cleary one of the better games we've played in a while.  This and Elasund are my favorite games of 2006.

Don't judge this game only by one play. This game starts to shine after a second play, when the tactical decisions become more clear. It is basically a handmanagement game.

The games were filled with risks, which seemed to be one of the major features of the strategy in our games.  UPDATE:Further plays have shown that there is a timing tactic in committing cards, which means players need to plan ahead for episodes that they need to win. The risks were overused in our previous plays. Starting to get the idea of risking (or not) at the right time. With good planning and card management, higher scores are coming in. UPDATE: Perhaps underappreciated game in that the risks will not win the game, as will proper focus on victory point production - akin to the new players in Dominion seeing all the neat kingdom cards but not obtaining the victory cards that really count.

Knizia does it again, using a similar mechanic to the redoubtable Taj Mahal. Beowulf is a true tour-de-force, combining auction-like play with the braggadocious risking of Beowulf's retainers into a fantastic whole that's like nothing else around. I can't believe I stayed away from this title for so long, even after owning it.

Reaction after one play (two-player, basic game, both players reading the rules at the table): not at all what I expected.  Almost a filler, a rather quick card- and risk-management game.  Typical Knizia could-be-anything theme, but play was interesting in a gambling kind of way.  I would imagine it would play quite differently with more players, however.

RATING: 8
This game is a lot of fun and was good with three and four players so I assume it will be great with five as well.  Players who plan ahead will do well, and every card and space serves a purpose.  The risks add a lot of fun to the game, unless you're chronically unlucky.  Managing the risk is a big part of the strategy - and the special cards are quite valuable in this regard.

A game comprised of mainly auctions using randomly drawn cards with few opportunities to tweak your hand in-between auctions.  No strategy, minimal tactics.  Success hinges on drawing the right cards at the right time and being clever in the auctions (getting your opponents to overbid while you take the bargains).  Too much randomness for an auction game.  Doesn't grab me.

The game is basically a long series of auctions. A first play is very hard to evaluate, because the game is entirely strategic: the auctions that happen at the end of the game will determine your choices from the very beginning, yet you have no idea what is required when you start playing. Will need to play again.

I'm not sure why this took so long to get to the table but I hope it will be back again soon.  I've seen a lot of reports say it takes a good few games to get into it but we were impressed right away.  I usually do well at auction games but was well behind on this one - you need to pick and choose when to win and lose very carefully because losing in this game can be very painful indeed.  Not the first 'multiple outcome' auction game I've played but it may be the best.  It looks good too - the artwork is by John Howe (who also did Knizia's LotR game) and the presentation is top notch - the well laid out box is crammed with an assortment of pieces - recommended.

RATING: 10
This is my top pick from Essen. I went in with some trepidation: a little underwhelming buzz, and some disappointment that it wasn't a follow-up to Lord of the Rings and shares only style, not substance. But it's been a big hit; enough to get 3 plays in the first 24 hours. I think it's because it has something for everyone: you've got the auctions of several varieties. You've got the strategic planning of managing resources for later auctions. You've got the tactical game of risk management with the Risks and Scratches. The Risks themselves add a bit of chaos and some excitement and a fun factor. Despite protestations from some quarters, the theme is quite solid (better than anything else from a major label at Essen). It plays quickly and everyone is always in the action.

It actually reminds me a bit of Ra. It's got the same auction flavor, the same tile-flipping tension, the same hard-to-quantify currency, a similar initial sense of chaos that is brought under control with repeated play. But it's got more variety than Ra, a much better theme, and more strategic planning (although Ra is the more focussed game).

All in all, I like it a lot, and of the three major hits from Essen (Hacienda, Elasund, Beowulf), this is the only one that has a sense of being a classic.

As an addenda, I am stunned by the low-rating folks who think the theme here is pasted on. I really have no idea what they are looking for or if they are actually playing the same game; the theme in Beowulf is as good as can be found in German-style games.  It is, in fact, amazingly clever. Knizia = Pasted On Theme has become an idea that way too many people are parroting without thinking. The theming in Beowulf is leagues better than the awkward at best job in Shadows over Camelot, and in my opinion Beowulf is one of the very, very few games that represents a legitimate artistic interpretation of its source material.

Forget the comparisons to LoTR and the early claims that this game is cooperative.  It's a very competitive auction game!

However, I still think it's pretty fun, and like it for a change of pace in the auction genre.

Strangely enough, I find this game compelling.  I shouldn't.  There is a significant luck factor, although, I tend to belief who makes the best decisions will win.  I have never read Beowulf, so the cards and the events made absolutely no sense to me.  However, this is a simplified Taj Mahal.  I was never bored, always felt as if I had choices and I was competing in the game.  It played the right amount of time for the design.  I just had a great time playing it.

Played with 5: rating's gone up though I think it's truly a 5-player game.  Very fun and a little different from other stuff.

Beowulf is an amusing adventure game that suffers from a lack of difficult decisions.  All you really have to do is decide on what auctions you want to lose and plan accordingly.  If you butt heads with someone you will suffer, if not then you will do well.  To me it basically comes down to what cards you get and how lucky you can get in the risks you take.  I like the board and the tacked-on theme elements, but the gameplay is a little non-engaging.

This game is beautiful and has an interesting game mechanic, and I like the legendary premise behind it, but it's too luck-based and repetitive for my taste.  The ability to (very)frequently "risk" to attempt to draw matching cards seems to take a lot of possible strategy out of the game.  It combines turn-based bidding and simultaneous auctions, but I felt the auctions got tedious by the end.

An excellent and easy to learn game that combines auction mechanics with a unique element of gambling. The theme was meaningless to me and added nothing to the game, but Kinizias magic maths triumphed again with this design. It would be a nine except for one fatal flaw ... a truckload of luck. The outcomes can change significantly with the random turn of a card and you can see big swings in the results. But this is a clever and elegant design.

I like the game; I think of it as an advanced push-your-luck game.  How much luck is in it?  A bunch, but it's all push-your-luck kind of luck, a gamble to choose or avoid, you can control that much, risky...I find that fun. It also helps me take the game lightly, encourages faster play. Lucky, but still requires meaningful decisions--you can't win by bad play. I find the decisions sometimes difficult. My biggest problem with the game is with the functional design of the board--the icons are too small, too closely spaced. I like the odd-shaped board, the originality of it... if only they used more of the space for the icons, less for the fantasy calendar type artwork. I think the graphic design could encourage more of the sense of playing out the story. For example, the words describing each episode/station are in my opinion, too small. I recommend this game, if you're okay with the push-your-luck factor. I have yet to win.

RATING: 6
Great art! Nice theme. Excellent components, except the board could be a lot more functional. The luck from the "risk" element is WAY out of control...to the point that I feel like it virtually breaks the game. For comparison, I think there is luck about on par with Clash of the Gladiators. Sure, you can shape your hand intelligently with an eye to what's next, but then someone with a lucky run of 3 or 4 successful "risks" in a row will undo it all. The swings of fate are so large and looping that it overwhelms all the decision-making. For a game of this length and this fiddly, that is not a good thing. I don't mind games with luck, but I felt like we may as well be playing War or Craps.

I do like the way the auctions work. Feels very much like For Sale, with more interesting outcomes that compound over the game.

I don't understand why the board wasn't designed to be a bit more functional. The spaces are too small for what they are supposed to do. 

Jason Little suggested playing where you are limited to a single "risk" per auction of that type. You could play it early (as a bluff when you still have cards to play). I think this would be nice. It still leaves some luck there, but the game would become incredibly more strategic this way. If I play again, I'd like to try it that way.

My last playing left a very sour feeling toward the game. I felt like none of my decisions mattered at all. That feeling is kind of cute in Clash of the Gladiators. I found it simply frustrating in Beowulf.

RATING: 4
The only thing that reminds me of Lord of the Rings is the story progression factor. Period.

Now that that's out of the way, this is basically Knizia's umpteen millionth hand management and card auction game. The story of Beowulf is thrown in for flavour, but this really could have been themed about 900 different ways with no real change in play. Basically, there are 5 suits of cards, and players use those cards through most of the game in Taj-esque auctions with the first player dropping out getting the worst item available, the next the next worst, and so on. Each auction will allow the use of two suits, and they also feature the option of "risking" by flipping up two cards from the draw deck...if a card or cards is flipped up which match those useable in the current auction then they are yours and are put into play immediately. If you fail you get scratched (bad) and are booted out of the auction immediately, even if you still had suitable cards in hand to play. 

The game also features blind bid auctions which are fairly straight-forward. There are no "risks" in such auctions, but there are still 2 suits, highest bid gets first pick of the 5 things available, and so on. In both cases, some of auctions have nothing terrible while others are full of badness, so there is an element of picking your fights to the game, and because the board shows what is coming up you can definitely plan ahead.

So why does this game end up with a 4? Because it just didn't do anything overly memorable, and because of the annoying risk element. The auctions are competitive, but usually don't have much excitement to them. The "risks" can add some flair, but I don't think they're enough to save the game and make it something special...they also inject a huge element of luck into a game which otherwise requires a lot of careful planning, which felt off. When one player can repeatedly succeed during risks in an auction it can throw the game completely out of whack. The elements of a Knizia game are certainly here: multiple scoring systems, good player interaction, but they just seem pedestrian in this particular instance.

(Note that this game gains 3 rating points if Josh Miller is reading the flavour text for each square in dramatic fashion to you)

OK, I'm really sick and frackin' tired of games where I'm trying "impress" someone by winning fame points or whatever...I want to _be_ Beowulf, not tag along and help him by playing "Friendship" cards!  This is yet another Knizia game that's long on mechanics and short on theme, and unfortunately the theme happens to be one of the greatest works of literature so there is a HUGE missed opportunity here to represent that story.  What we have is the typical Knizia mechanics (a little Taj, a little Ivanhoe, a little Ra, a little Modern Art lots of LotR) rehashed into a passable, playable game that feels like a mathematical exercise- not slaying Grendel.  Oh yeah, Beowulf slays Grendel, the players just get to tag along and play through auctions and rounds of bluffing or bidding.  Granted, it's the kind of game that Knizia does well and it works just fine, I'm just really at odds with this school of design right now.  The game could really be about anything, despite its attempts to fool us otherwise.  Grr...very frustrated.

The game has far more luck that I would have expected from the box size. Eclipses Manilla in that regard. Still, I enjoy it for what it is. I don't have a problem with luck in and of itself. There IS a card management game in there. AND there are enough random samplings that I *think* the luck gets close enough to evening out. Actually, the card management reminds me a bit of Marco Polo (another Knizia game I liked more than I expected from others' reviews), in that you want to choose what cards to spend and keep based on looking ahead to future spots on the path. I'm not sure if my rating will hold after repeated playings, but I've enjoyed my few playings. But it's completely understandable when someone seems to repeatedly fail their risks for them to dismiss it as a luckfest.

This game is less RANDOM than it appears. Play with the gold face up."Almost nothing in the game can be easily or concretely evaluated, so you're making constant judgement calls about what is worth how much, how much extra it's worth spending to get 5 Fame instead of the "negate one failed risk" card, and how far to push your luck. Even in Ra, which I consider a masterpiece, you can sometimes run the numbers to see exactly how many points a set of tiles is worth to various players; in Beowulf, everything is a judgment call. This makes for a great, absorbing game." Chris Farrell.


[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** El Beowulf - The Legend creo que es el mejor juego del Knizia del 2005 y el más caro.

El Beowulf es un juego de subastas planificadas en el que hay de dos tipos, a ciegas o en círculo.
Lo que no esta gustando de este juego es que parece que hay mucho factor suerte, a mí sinceramente de momento me parece que no es tan exagerado. Parece un juego familiar cosa que corre a su favor ya que también le gustara a muchos de los gamers, de hecho hay algunos que han escrito muy buenas criticas.

A parte de esto, el juego tiene muchas mas cosas a favor, cada uno le da sus valores a cada carta y a cada objeto en cada momento, no es como el RA que sabes exactamente que valor tiene cada cosa con un cálculo matemático.

El factor de planificación en cualquier juego me parece un gran añadido, te sirve para organizarte e intentar apurar mas en unos momentos o en otros y con un golpe de vista sabes lo que hay que hacer al siguiente turno.

Yo juego con los marcadores de fama y de tesoros que cada jugador consigue a la vista de todo el mundo, los de alianza, ocultos, es mejor hacerlo así ya que lo hace un poco más estratégico y a penas cambia la regla original.[/COLOR]

I've never played an unenjoyable game of Beowulf, and look forward to playing it many more times.  The theme is not as thin as you might think, and the production values are excellent.  I love the risk mechanic, and the ability to decide when a risk is worth taking.

Wasn't sure if I would like this game, game board strange, it is laid out in a track, odd shape. This is a remarkable good game. Better playing game than Ra, or Medici. Ra has that singular bid mechanics, with BtL you get more bidding options. Bidding is basically used to replacing dice rolls in games like this. About the risk element, if you play this game and don't take any, you are missing one point of the game, i.e. it is a risk management game, used to improve your card hand. This doesn't dominate the game, but, it is an important element. You need to size up when it is worth it to take a risk. Why it works is, you can see ahead on the board along the track what cards will be needed. It may be better to pass on a risk, go in weak on the next event, because you need to come out on top of the one after, i.e. pick your battles, save up. Google Reiner's old phd bank job and it should not surprise you why you might see risk management included in his game. A very under looked game. Well worth seeking out.

I've played a handful of times now and still enjoy it.  The luck factor is sizable, but strategy and tactics are important.  Moves quickly and reminds me a little of Taj Mahal in the "who'll blink first" aspect, except here it can come down to sheer luck as opposed to hand management and card tracking.  The luck makes losing a hand easier to swallow that's for sure. :)

Played once so may decrease after further playing.  I found it very interesting, reminiscent in some ways of Taj Mahal (the bidding).  Not sure yet whether it will hold up.

[b]Thumbs Up:[/b] A fun ride, but how I do varies widely between matches, which bugs me a bit. When I win big, I do not feel like I did anything particularly masterful, while when I lose big, I wonder why I did not place better.

I like this best with five players, and using the advanced rules is a must.

Things I really like: Hand management in preparation for upcoming battles is one of my favorite mechanisms, although it is a bit one-dimensional here; the risk element is what really makes the game shine in terms of *fun*.

Things I sorta dislike: The endgame is a bit too much "I can do this and that to net 6 points, or those two things to net 8, but the former will give Bill 3 extra points while the latter benefits Carol..." (the random tokens help with this somewhat); variance in risk luck is pretty huge within the context of a single game, so it feels like one of those games you have to play tens of times to find out who is the "best" player; font/icon size on the board is too small, which leads to ergonomic issues (I'm tempted to make "Beowulf Neck" a standard classification for game injuries, a la "Ra Elbow").

This is a competitive version of Knizia's Lord of the Rings game, with auctions.  The idea sounds good, but the game in practice just felt dull to me (and most everyone I played it with).  There's a fair amount of luck and there just doesn't appear to be much in the way of strategy.

Quirky, odd Knizia design that works anyway. You aren't playing Beowulf; instead you are one of his warriors competing with each other to impress him and ultimately become king when he dies. It's hard to describe...you play through the parts of the book using different methods to succeed in each part. You can't do well at everything, so often making do while planning for a later adventure is required. I enjoyed it, and it certainly is unique.

Beowulf is a brilliant, thematically rich game, full of adventure and wild risk-taking.  Read each story episode aloud in your best viking voice and let the dullards know just why it takes companionship to succeed in Hrothgar's Hall or how far a little craftiness can take you during the Celebration.  Beyond thematic considerations, this is a really great auction game, loaded with risk management, hand management, strategic planning and loads of tough-to-evaluate auctions, with rewards ranging from good to less-good to downright bad.  You don't want to get caught with your pants down when the Seahag Attacks.

RATING: 5
Comments and rating based on the two-player version. Players follow a linear path through, what amounts to, an outline of the story Beowulf. Players are competing for the same awards, but are working toward the common goal of accompanying Beowulf through a series of episodes on his journey. Each of the episodes along the path is one of several "mini-games"; blind auction, open auction, award gathering, award/card swaps, and risks. Risks allow players to draw from the face-down deck in hopes of obtaining needed activity cards. There are several types of awards, such as treasure, fame, and alliance tokens. Each of these awards just serve as victory points in the end. Players can get negative results from mini-games, as well, either in the form of wounds or fame point reduction. It does have some elements in common with another Reiner Knizia title, The Lord of the Rings: (1) Obviously, both games are based on works of literature. (2) Players follow a linear path and must resolve conflicts and predetermined points along the way.(3) These conflicts are resolved using symbol cards from the player's hand and if the player lacks the proper card, the conflict is lost. These commonalities are not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, but they do exist. My feeling is that if you like the gameplay of Lord of the Rings, then you probably have a good chance of liking this title, as well. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of LotR and I'm not a huge fan of this game either. It's not bad, but it's just not my type of game. I think that it is too linear and that it will ultimately lack replay value. The art is gorgeous, but it's just a backdrop for the game, as opposed to being a fully integrated part of the game that adds personality like in Power Grid, for example.

Fun, if a bit luck-driven, with not a few tough decisions. Our group played it as a 5-player game and immediately wanted to play again. That is a good thing!

For some reason, people expect absolute miracles from Knizia and rate games as 5 or less if they're not Taj Mahal. TOWER OF BABEL is a better game than the BGG ratings imply IMHO as well.

BEOWULF is a better game than LOTR IMHO and deserves a look.

Recommended.

The art is amazing in this game and it's almost worth buying it for this alone. The game is so-so, but I guess it's all about your play group here. I like the game despite the randomness but many of my friends despise it. Ok, you can play like a fool, have a lot of luck an still win but there's more planning involved here than you'd think at first.

Rating might rise on further playings. 

Edit: More plays shows that luck is far better than strategy and this drags the rating down.

Lightweight but surprisingly good game.  The advanced game is much more interesting than the basic game, as it tightens resources further and adds an extra level of decision-making when you claim rewards.  Luck can play a factor, more often in making a player lose than win.

Rating after one 5er game.  I liked it but was a little underwhelmed.  The theme is pretty weak IMO.  Basically you move a token down a chart and do that action.  Usually the action is some kind of auction/bid where you use cards in an attempt to get VPs.  There are some other spots where you draw cards or trade cards in for VPs.  Really, I think the decisions are fairly minimal in this game. Also, there is a great deal of luck when "taking Risks".  If you choose not to take Risks you will lose.  If you choose to take Risks and get unlucky, it will be difficult to win.  Unfortunately the card deck is large enough that you can't really get a handle on your probabilities w/taking Risks.  So it feels like a 50/50 shot each time. I'm not crazy about that portion, but the game is fast enough that I'd be happy to play again.

RATING: 8
Another classy 60 minute game from Reiner Knizia.  Players represent followers of Beowulf (from the epic poem), and tag along lending assistance on his adventures.  Lending assistance means winning, or placing well, in "in the fist" or "round the table" auctions. Bids are made with card suits, or treasures, depending on the episode being resolved.  Between auctions players get the opportunity to recharge their hands via minor episodes.  Simple, subtle mechanics, with an excellent risk/scratch mechanic thrown in.  Plays very well, even with two players.

A very good strategic game of bidding and push-your-your-luck guts. However the thematic veil really is a problem here, and also the hand-management really takes a back seat to the luck of the draw.

It's very thematic much more so than the Kingdoms pt 2 Beowulf game.  The game sticks to a story line the entire time.  That's the game; a story line.  It could be a little bit of a drawback because you must always play in the same order.

RATING: 7
I think the people who have described this game as a combination of Taj Mahal and Lord of the Rings are dead on.  The game shares the brinksmanship bidding of Taj Mahal and the set storyline and events of Lord of the Rings.  The game feels lighter than either of its parents, and it is a good game in its own right.  My primary criticism of the game is the tiny board spaces.  The pieces don't even fit in them, and they are very hard to read from across the board.  The spaces should have been twice as big, and there is plenty of empty space on the board for them to have done so.  Yes, the background art is nice, but I'd much rather have had bigger spaces.

Beowulf: The Auction.   Which maybe would work okay (apart from not being thematic at all), but there is a way to risk it and draw extra cards to add to your bid.  So, then it becomes an auction game with a lot of luck.  Not a good combo.

Here is a fun, fast, and mostly simple game. I enjoy the various aspecys of each "legend" from bidding outright to round the table style. Some say the ability to draw random cards during a bid adds too  uch of a luck factor, but I enjoy this aspect if nothing else then for the "AHHHH!" when someone either gets the card they need or fails terribly. Have played a half dozen times and enjoed it with both 3, 4, and 5 players.

I enjoy this one quite a bit. I like it better than Knizia's Lord of the Rings. Both games share the hand management aspect, but competition and bidding are key here. My rating reflects my feelings that the game play rates about a 7, but the fact that I'm usually keen to get it to the table rates it an 8. It's fast, which is a real plus. It has a fair amount of strategy, yet it isn't a brain burner like a lot of other Knizia games (also a plus). The only downside might prove to be replayability... I'm not sure if I'll still be playing this one a year or two from now. Also, the board is more of a flow chart than a real board, but I found that the gameplay was so interesting that I got over this aspect quickly. The cards and card art are nice quality. Overall, I'm pleased that I own this one. It is easy to teach to other gamers in about 10 minutes, and the luck of the risks and card draws means that even a newbie can be reasonably competetive.

Uncool game for some reason, and Knizia seems to be more uncool than other at present. Still this is a decent game. Mechanically you progress down a track depicting Beowulf's journey playing card auctions, drafts and various gambles. It is surprisingly fun and has its tension and narrative flow. Worth picking up on the cheap before it disappears forever.

I have hopes that this is a nicely strategic affair, but I'm still a little unsure if the "risking" is unbalanced.  Since most people will not have calculated the odds of successfully risking, you start to get the feeling that maybe you should just risk almost all the time, at least until the wounds start getting problematic.

Played twice at the time of rating. A competent game, worthy of a bit more examination. While my initial reaction was "Hmm, interesting," I don't know if I'm ready to give it a solid rating yet. I'm a bit neutral, because the game really requires more than a couple plays before giving up all of its secrets. My gut tells me that my rating will drop with subsequent plays.

If I didn't know Taj Mahal or Lord of the Rings, I'ld think this is a brilliant game.  However, I do.  My impression is that Beowulf doesn't do anything better than Taj Mahal does and it just dresses up LotR in a new costume with a barrowed twist.  There's been ample harking about the Risk part of the game, so I'll limit my comments to yes, there can be some monumental shifts of luck while drawing for risk but it's not any worse than a lot of other ways of resolving random events.  My own particular problem is that even though I enjoyed playing, my usual partners are not likely to prefer this over other similar games.  It is beautiful to look at but the rest is so familiar that I can imagine them telling me that they'ld rather play Taj Mahal.

I always love to play Beowulf because it plays at a fast pace and offers lots of auction based confrontation with the other players.  Finishes are usually close and instead of slowing down with more players it gets better!  It's great fun for 5. In my mind this game is simply auction based melee combat with the other players at the table.  The story and theme are ok but the goal here is to deplete the other players hands of cards and hang a bright red wound token around their necks.  The auctions allow you to exert yourself when the situation seems critical by spending cards or risking.  Don't fall behind early and avoid wasting resources to heal.  Time is short in Beowulf, the pace is quick.  The combat feel of the game makes it a favorite for me and I think it's a game with a strong 'push your luck- play from the gut' streak.  We record the winners of Beowulf inside the box lid- It's a game best played with grudge!

Played twice. Very nice graphics by John Howe. Feels a bit like a mix between Ra and Taj Mahal. There is some luck involved in the risk taking, but if you don't calculate your risks you will lose in the long run. The risk element fits very well with the theme. A solid Knizia design, but I have to play it a few more times before I can tell if it measures up to his older masterworks.

RATING: 10
Beowulf is a fun game of hand management and pressing your luck. While it may appear to be Knizia's next 'heavy' game (big box, tons of pieces) it's really a medium/lightish game that can easily be played in 30-60 minutes. 
Beowulf is at it's best with more players, but I still really like it with only 2. It plays almost like a quick filler with 2 players, but offers a bit more than your standard filler.

After 10+ games I certainly don't feel like the luck of the risks plays as big of a part in the game as some would suggest. Sure, there's luck, but that's the whole point. It's not an unbalancing amount though and it does add a lot of tension and fun into the game. 
In 2005 Knizia put out 3 incredible medium weight games in Tower of Babel, Beowulf, and Palazzo. They all play fast, are simple to learn, and offer plenty of choices and lots of fun.

RATING: 7
[Auctions, Resource management, Cardgame] [4P:7,5P:7] This is an extremely unusual light-middleweightish Reiner Knizia cardgame built around The Legend of Beowulf. Players follow the legendary hero around and events surrounding certain encounters in Beowulf's story are auctioned off. Do well and you are rewarded with fame, gold and resources. Do poorly and you get whacked, sometimes whacked silly. Beowulf has that distinctive FFG production - nice art, average quality bits (at best), and some superfluous amenities. The board - oy, the board. The episode circles are too small and are hard to see in less-than-bright light. The game might have looked better taking a page from its distant cousin, The Lord of the Rings. Have a separate board for the whole journey, and "blow up" segments into a larger main board with clearer information. And the shield thing is a weird design choice. Anyway. Beowulf relies heavily on card management and counting. Its pervasive "risk" mechanism may turn off gamers who don't like a lot of randomness and luck in their games. My personal take - the luck is acceptable because there is an opt-out. Don't take the risks. You might lose to a lucky player, but your game performance over time should be more consistent. This is pretty decent game from RK, but I'm not much for its rhythm. Too stop-and-go, lacking the fluidity of Lord of the Rings, rush of Clash of the Gladiators and lightning & thunder of Taj Mahal. I was hoping for a lot of high drama. There were a few, such as when two players are locked in an All Risk Death Struggle, but that's not strong enough to sell me on the game. It also takes a bit too long for what it delivers. However, it is pretty unique - despite direct comparisons to Taj Mahal and Lord of the Rings, it really isn't anything like those two games. It's another of RK's finely-tuned lighter games, with a huge wrench called "risk" thrown into the works to make things more interesting. I also think that it has some decent theme-to-mechanisms integration, but it's nowhere near as strong as many of RK's other games. Final verdict - ok, I'll play if asked, but I'm not moved to suggest it and much less to own it. *** UPDATE: I need to say that the current rating of '6' is rock bottom for Beowulf - there is potential for it to improve. The game does have its strong points, and I believe that more play may improve my opinion due to shortening game length AND improved, more judicious play. The resource management of Beowulf isn't inconsequential, and I've played more that enough of RK's designs that I'm certain there is far more than meets the eye in the risk mechanism than even a half-dozen plays reveal. Oh, and I may eventually have to rescind my "theme-to-mechanisms tie weakness" comment... I'm coming around on that one the more I play and think about it. But the game's rhythm is still confusing to me - not unusual though since Modern Art, Taj Mahal and Traumfabrik all gave (and often still give) me fits.

Update: I realize now that this was one of the first boardgames I ever played. I think I might appreciate it more now if I went back to try it again. A lot of luck, but good for gateway gaming purposes.

The theme was a little lost on me, I admit. 

There's a lot of hand management and planning ahead you should be able to do in this game. The push your luck aspect of it keeps it lighthearted throughout but I had a really hard time grasping the system and making sense of the decisions I had to make.

Beowulf is a fun, fast game of risk and card management.  This is one of those games that gets played when there is not enough time left in the evening to play a really complicated game.  It usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes to play a 3-4 player game, and about an hour for a full 5-player game.  However gamers who only like strategy-heavy games, often don't care for Beowulf, and see it only as a card game.

This game is a lot more random than it looks. To the core, it's about taking risks because not doing so hurts too much. However, huge amounts of points can shift hands on a lucky draw. If you play it in the spirit of a "casino"-like game with a little bit of risk management and tactics then it becomes very good. Every time you draw a card there is a lot of pressure and the room explodes if you get lucky. If you seek a bidding game rewarding a good ability to evaluate, then this is not for you.

Beowulf feels a bit like the competitive sibling of Knizia's Lord of the Rings. Instead of playing their cards to further the one cause here the players try to outbid each other while helping Beowulf on his legendary trip.

Basically, the game is just a sequence of auctions strung together with interspersed events to replenish card hands or collect treasure all of which can be used in auctions later on.

The game includes quite a bit of luck, especially through the gambles players can make along the way. As you can expect with Knizia, however, the full package is well-balanced and there are always opportunities to hedge your bets.

Beowulf is a bit abstract but well-suited for casual play.

Fairly fun game, nice components.  Not one I'd want to play all the time but I think it's a fairly good game.  Unfortunately it's seventeen kinds of derivative of Knizia's other stuff (put about five of his games in a blender and grind 'em up) and gameplay actually has about as much to do with Beowulf as a pair of gym socks do.  A game where I must "impress" Beowulf?  Do we have some sort of inferiority complex here?  Must we always be kissing the ass of some benevolent gaming superbeing that exists outside of our universe in ways we cannot comprehend?

RATING: 5.274
This is an unusual game. You are definitely at the whim of luck in getting cards via the risk mechanic, so unless you except this as part of the game space, you will not like this game.  Lite bidding with card manipulation game.  Certainly a different mechanic, and you can read the summary of the poem at each step to improve the theme, but ultimately, it's just an ok game. Also, card art is such that it is difficult not to do fisting and horn jokes when you first start the auctions.  Would play again, but would not demand (April 2014; rate 6). UPDATE: I think I have kept this because I only paid $1 for it, but I can’t see myself every playing this again, so gone (rating 5, Dec 2014).  Sold at CANCON15 for $6; so a 500% profit (after admin fee) for a second hand game!!!  Will never beat that (Jan 15). UPDATE 3SF 5.274 Jan 17

RATING: 7
An interesting game that I am compelled to bring back to the table soon.  Comparisons with LOTR for me are only substantiated by Howe's artwork, if Beowulf has any origins it feels to me they lie in Taj Mahal.  The comparison I draw is because of the hand management and poker element of card play.  It is also a game in which decisions are set for the future with some tactical play in the immediate rounds.  Although the strategy is light, Beowulf seems to build enough of a game around risk taking, and clever card play.  More games are needed to see if this game rises or falls in my ratings.

UPDATE: This game is just fun. the elements of risk taking, and bluff are wonderfully executed.  People may hate the luck, but then that's what a risk is.  It plays quickly, has a good amount of tension, and the decisions are real. I agree with my earlier accessment that this is the lighter sibling of Taj. Rating up to 8.

UPDATE: I still enjoy Beowulf, and maybe it is dependent upon the group i nestle down to play this with, but i believe i over stated my enthusiasm after my last couple plays. beowulf belongs at a 7.

A very very good game that (astonishingly - after all it's a Knizia design) has a theme that fits. Actually every round is an auction, sometimes auction with a twist but all in all it's a bidding game. The artwork by John Howe is georgeus and so are the pieces.

Well, it looks nice, and you half-expect there to be some theme to it, but nope, it's arbitrary.  Knizia's LotR has far more theme, and more exciting art.  You never feel like you are progressing through the story, that is for sure.  As for the game itself, it is hand management and auctions.  A little like Marco Polo, but with Auctions, and a little more chaos.  There is some variety, but not much.

Update: I feel compelled to give this one another try.

RATING: 8
It's a bidding game with some luck.  It has good theme.  It is tight and well-balanced, as any Knizia game is.  The amount of luck is commensurate with the feel of the game, and with the time it takes to play it.

I realized finally what a lot of new players do, and why then the game seems like simply so much luck. New players go into every auction and play every card they can, then start risking until they are out. Instead, you need to judge when you can win an auction, and only then start playing cards from your hand. Much like poker.

If you don't care for auction games, you probably won't like Beowulf much. It's basically a series of auctions themed to walk players through the story of Beowulf. It all depends on the cards you're dealt and how well you are able to build that hand with the items needed to win the upcoming auctions. In many cases you can take a risk, drawing two cards that, if they match cards on the board, you get to keep and put into the auction. Much of a player's success in the game depends on those risk draws, it seems. I liked this quite well even though I'm not a huge fan of auction-type games. The game plays faster than one would expect and there's really no downtime to speak of. It's just constantly playing cards into auctions and trying to figure out what you'll need for the next one.

Damn. Beowulf gets killed by the dragon?! Guess I can take that book back.

After three plays, I'm done with Beowulf.  My final verdict is that the game presents an awkward mix of strategy and blind luck.  It appears to present opportunities for strategic decision-making, fooling the players into thinking that those decisions will matter.  Usually, though, they don't, because this is a game about getting the lucky flip of cards just when you need it.  Those who play it safe will lose (unless everyone plays it safe).  Those who take risks and fail will lose.  The winner will be the player who takes risks and succeeds.  Not every game needs to be a "strategic planning" game, but Beowulf fails because it presents itself to the players as this type of game, but is not.  Another pitfall is the theme, which does not come through strongly despite evocative artwork.  For those trying Beowulf for the first time, be prepared to revel in the dramatic turns of fortune and don't take this one too seriously.

Thirteen plays. I enjoy the game play; the card jousting is fun, there's some look-ahead and planning, and it's just very engaging in general. There's a certain amount of luck involved, but I think the luck is implemented in an entertaining way. I haven't tried it with two but it seems to work equally well with three, four and five.

The only odd thing about the game is that afterwards I never feel like I know why I won or lost. So much happens in such an incremental way that I can never point to any particular moment in the game and peg it as a good decision or a bad one. However, I 'm starting to think that lots of risking and sucking up two wounds might be the way to go.

RATING: 5
We had some laughs with this one, but they were supplied by the players, rather than being a product of the game. The relationship between theme and mechanics feels pretty remote, but if played as a lampoon where thick-headed norsemen compete for gold while trying to avoid head wounds, then you'll get a kick out of it. I didn't feel like an adventurer so much as a drunk in a horned helmet, following Beowulf around with a golf-bag full of swords ("I recommend a five-iron to ace the Sea Hag, m'Lord"). Plays fast and I won't groan when it hits the table, but neither am I very likely to pull it off the stack.

Having played Taj Mahal (which seems like a related game), I think that I can say that Taj is the deeper game...but I enjoy Beowulf more.  In particular, I really enjoy the Risk rules, which add a visceral thrill to the game as well as a risk management dimension to the gameplay.

UPDATE: bumping this to a 10. I can't think of a time that I wouldn't want to play this game. It's best with five, but even with three it does really, really well.

Tense, as much a test of guts as resource management. Very, very fun.

I don't normally like bidding games, but this is one of the better ones I've liked.  It's easy to see what you will need in the future and weigh that against what you can gain or lose in the current encounter.  If this had a more accessible theme, like farmers trading apples, grains, etc. at different markets, with wounds replaced by say another negative, like worms in the fruit, etc.  I think my non-gamer family would play this.  As is, the theme seems totally misplaced, but for gamers who like bidding games, this might be a good choice.  Don't go in to it expecting a good ameritrash romp, though.  I'd definitely play this again, and glad to have a (heavily discounted) copy.

:star::star::star::star::nostar:
A recent revisit allows me to rethink my position on this one. I like it much more than I did before. Although the complaint about the usability of the board still stands, I've changed my mind about the theme. Everyone who complains about it should fault themselves for forcing their own misguided expectations on the game. You're trying to impress Beowulf, not be him. The card play represents how much you are willing and able to stay in the fight with him. You have to choose your battles to be successful. I think this is definitely an undervalued classic.

A nice auction game. There are enough decisions to keep it interesting. The risks are really a neat touch, however they are also the source of the biggest swings of luck, which may break the game for some. My two biggest problems with the game are the theme and the board design. The theme is very "pasted on" and does nothing to either elucidate game play or educate about Beowulf. If you're looking for a game that makes you feel like a barbarian adventurer, this isn't it. The design is just plain frustrating. The icons are informative, but far too small to be of much use. The artwork by John Howe is very nice, but this is a game foremost and a work of art second. Function should outweigh form, and here it clearly doesn't and the player suffers for it.

Beowulf's story is told in a series of auctions. Unfortunately, luck of the draw is decisive, sometimes to the point of making the auctions meaningless. Hand management is secondary, as you may simply keep drawing cards until you win the auction or are knocked out by bad luck. I love the theme, but it's quite superficial. Its implementation reminded me of "Lord of the Rings" (another Knizia game with art by John Howe), while the mechanics recalled "Taj Mahal", but both are much better games.

I think this is very much like Taj Mahal, only fun. I believe that its balance of skill (hand management, planning, tradeoffs, when to risk) and luck (card draws) is pretty darn excellent--with perhaps the exception of seating order. Being able to break ties is huge, and sitting to the left of the dude who failed his risk in the first round seems just too big a windfall. Other than that, though, I think Beowulf is a real winner--and I confess I don't understand what the nay-sayers are going on about.

Played with 4.  I actually think I like it a bit more with less players, but still excellent for 4 as well.  Like Chris said, it feels like Ra in depth and weight.  Like Ra, I doubt I will ever tire of playing this.

Reminiscent of the strategies used in LotR, quite a good game, but I'd rather be a hero than try to impress beowulf.  Anyway, unlike LotR, the theme is mostly tacked on.
edit: much like LotR, the theme feels tacked on because my expectations of theme = simulation. True, that game could be about any saga, but I cannot say the theme is not there and with little effort, an auction becomes a bragging contest or a battle.
Crazy over bidding and risk taking makes of this overlooked title a fun, very fun way to spend an hour, and there is definitely a strategy that you must change to adapt all the time.  
It also compares favourably to Taj Mahal; here Knizia kept the game of chicken and ditched the boring parts.

Previously was rated a 7 - increased to an 8 for a number of reasons.  I wanted to try a house rule where you couldn't continually risk on the round-robin bidding due to too much randomness.  However, I found that wouldn't have worked very well - those who were stuck in poor sitting position would have very little hope of winning those.

I've reconsidered and found that taking a scratch for continued risking is a fair judgment.  It's especially hard to consider doing if you're already at 2 and would then be risking a wound.

All in all, a fun risk and hand management game.  I'd like it more if playing with people who were familiar with the game so it went a little faster.  There still is a good amount of randomness from card and scroll drawings but you have to choose your battles knowing that winning scrolls may net you anywhere from 1-3 points or treasure, in comparison with the static points.

I know nothing about Beowulf so the theme isn't a turnoff for me.  I don't mind tagging along Beowulf's side for an adventure.

Played once and would like to play again. I believed that getting the special cards early on would help me when in fact it did nothing but burn resources. The ability to use "risk" innumerable times seemed to negate the need to strategically play the cards you have. The artwork was very nice but the playing field seemed poorly designed. With how loose the theme was draped, it could have been wrapped in any other genre.

An engaging game of card asset / management that involves degrees of short and long term bidding and risk taking projection.

A bidding game, in the Knizia tradition, with the added ability to plan ahead.  (You can see, on the board, what's coming up for bid next, and what resources you'll need to compete.)

On the surface it looks like a mess—the saga of Beowulf, as told through multiple auctions (?!)—but it manages to hang together.  I rather liked it.

Rating based on initial impression of a single play.  Will update with more.

This game is all about being lucky with the cards.  Don't have enough to keep going in a category?  Just take a risk, see what happens!  I sat through the player following me not ever needing to take cards, just always took points, cause everytime he flipped he got 2 symbols without playing a card from hand.  It was fairly lame, and I won't play again.

The bidding reminded me of Taj Mahal, but instead of getting a lesser reward (or no reward), the game actively punishes you for losing auctions, and the players are constantly competing over the same symbols.  It's easy to get caught in a negative feedback loop that sucks a lot of fun out of the game.  The random element of the risks is also pretty huge.  The game was also longer than my interest in it and moving along the path somehow failed to generate much excitement.  On the other hand, the bidding was interesting in a Taj Mahal kind of way. 

And I seldom say things like this, but come on, for a Beowulf game this needs to be a lot more violent. (1 play)

Played it once, should give it another try. Love Knizia games. Muy bueno, aunque subestimado en el universo de los juegos de Knizia. Juego competitivo con sabor "cooperativo" porque los jugadores ayudan a Beowulf en las aventuras pero realmente están compitiendo por ser el mejor guerrero (i.e. puntos de victoria). Uno se desplaza en el tablero resolviendo aventuras, utilizando astutamente las cartas que va adquiriendo. Manejo y control de cartas, saber en qué aventuras participar y en cuáles abstenerse.

First played June 28th, 2007.  Rules explaination takes about 10 minutes and the game play takes about an hours with 4 or 5 players.  It seems it would play only slightly shorter with less people.  It has a fair mix of strategy and luck.  Perhaps the luck did tip the scales a bit however it didn't seem to impact the game.  The game was very structured and you could see what was coming up and decided how to use your options.  It does have a lot of blind and open bidding in it too which fits the game.  I did have high expectations of the game, we played it twice in a row, so I left it with the feeling time should pass before the next game play.  I'd recommend giving this a game play, and consideration in playing every once in a while.

Enjoying it more with each replay. Plays fast. And its fun to take the risks.

Well balanced too. The number of players changes what is won in each round.

Be careful in some of the later rounds. Yes, you only get a scratch if you fail a risk... but the bottom rung prize is also a scratch, giving you two total scratches for being the first to risk and fail.

Other than concerns I have over replay-ability, this is an excellent game.  The risks that everyone complains about are minimal and will never decide who wins overall.  I like how a person can pursue a few different strategies even though all players will take the same path (even knowing what's coming).  This gives a new breath of fresh air to the LotR design making it a worthy game to add to Knizia's accolades.

The theme and presentation of the game cover that fact that Beowulf is in many ways a typical mid-weight Knizia game, cleverly-designed and apparently well-balanced. It does have a significant element of chance, but that is part of its appeal as a game of tactical risk management coupled with some longer-term decision-making. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Make sure when you are taught that you take note of what is coming up 2-3 bids ahead....especially the spots that aren't bids but you sacrifice cards for other items.  These are the key spots on the board.

Gold is everything...it is the way to victory from what I saw.

Don't be afraid to risk it...many times it is easily worth it.

Addition:  Rating falls to 5.5.  Game is totally random.  You win if you risk all the time and get lucky.  Whoever does this wins, whoever doesn't loses...let's just roll a die and whoever rolled highest won so we can go on and play something good...

Update:  Rating falls to 4.  One more play, one more example of the lucky risker winning.  I'm fairly certian this is true across the board now, making this a game I'd never willingly play again.  If anyone at the table is risking a lot, you have to--you cannot play it safe unless everybody is--because one of the riskers is going to be on a roll....which hands them the game.  

Update:  Its a 2.  A terrible 2.  RISK RISK RISK and get lucky and WIN!  Or you lose.

initial rating 3 plays

Another addicting game in the discovery phase from the doc, that is if you like 'push you luck' games like RA or the tension filled auctions of something like TAJ. 

Essentially risk management is the core, when to risk and when not to risk, mixed with hand management and planning ahead. Luck of the draw? Of course! The whole point really although counting cards can help alleviate it somewhat and help you play the odds so definitely a game for gambler's. Really a game best played for the 'fun' aspect and plays quick which goes towards this. 

Scales well 2 to 5, at least I enjoy it with even 2 as the risking part of the game is FUN and it works fine with just 2, 3 might be best actually. 

Gold variant - plays well and although it added to the game it didn't add that much. 

If you like TAJ and/or RA don't be scared to give this a try unless you can't handle some luck of the draw of course, keep in mind it is a 60 - 90 minute game which is why I don't mind the luck.

One of my favorite possible themes for a game, and they pretty much blew it!  This is more an exercise in playing cards than a game. There little tension and the difference between coming in first or last in a major event is sometimes very small. Maybe more of a game for younger kids or non-gamers but not a gamer's game by any stretch.  Pretty disappointed in the lack of game here teamed with this awesome theme. However others seem to disagree so I'm going to give this another chance.

Beowulf has luck in the same (and only) place it has strategy and tactics: hand management. In addition to the luck of the draw, which is reasonably small and the usual factor in hand management games. Mechanics are bidding oriented. Overall the game is too repetative.

Interesting, fun bidding game. I generally love bidding games like this one, and there is much to like here. I am still undecided about the really controversial mechanism in the game - the procedure for risking. On the one hand it adds something unique and fun to the game, but on the other hand it made the outcome of many episodes seem completely random. I suspect I will either discover its strengths, or alternatively end up hating it. :-)

RATING: 7
Based on one solo playing.Some have slated this game for being nothing new, and certainly if you've played many other Knizia auction games a lot of it may feel familiar. Taj Mahal players in particular will recognise the use of cards to drive auctions for varying prizes, although it's not as brain-burning as that one.However, it is a nicely done and nicely produced game - thick cards and counters, nice artwork, and a nice Beowulf figure (albeit he's just a turn marker!) You need to balance current and potential future resources against the need to spend them to acquire point-scoring tiles. The use of a second resource (treasure) beyond the main reourcse of cards in the auctions adds depth. Not all of the actions are auctions (if you see what I mean!), and there is an element of risk taking involved (you can often gamble to gain extra cards, but at the risk of being wounded - and too may wounds will cost you at game end).If you haven't got many auction games in your collection this one is worth considering. If you've got a shelf groaning under the weight of Ra, Modern Art, Taj Mahal, Gravediggers etc. you might want to try it first, but for the £10 I paid (TK Maxx, thank you) it's a bargain.

Another good plus is that there is only 1 figure to paint!

Excellent bidding game.  I hear lots of complaints about the "Risk" mechanic putting too much luck into the game, but honestly, that usually evens out over the course of the game.  The heart of the game comes down to weighing potential risk/cost/reward and (believe it or not) resource management.  Love this game.

Beowulf's most distinctive quality has nothing to do with gameplay. It is the L-shaped board that's unusual seemingly for the sake of being unusual.  In the game, players move in linear fashion from space to space, drawing cards or playing cards as required in order to gain gold, victory points, or special cards. Players can also pick up wounds that count against their score at the end of the game. Almost all of the decisions in the game boil down to auctions in order to gain the above mentioned items. Auctions are in the form of blind bidding cards from your hand, or sequential bidding, depending on what the board dictates. It's a very scripted game with few decisions and scant room for creative gameplay or meaningful actions.

Could be a grower. I would need to give this a few plays to see how it sits. I'd be happy to do so, though. It's different, fast, and amusing. Obviously a game in risk-management, to such an extent that some players can't see anything more than luck and chaos. Clearly more to it than that.

I can understand why this game got such a bad reception. It's stuck in the middle and lacks a clear target group. Eurogamers won't like the high luck factor, family gamers won't enjoy the auction part and Ameritrash fans won't touch a Knizia with a stick. But it's better than its reputation if you consider it as Ameritrash for Eurogamers and just go with the flow. Not sure how much can be influenced but there might be more than obvious.

Another wonderful auction game by Dr. Knizia, with a nifty push-your-luck element as well. In this case your currency are sets of cards, similar in composition to the cards in his LotR cooperative game. Make no mistake, this is not a cooperative game. You bid cards for Beowulf's affections. Every bid counts and you lose your cards regardless of the outcome, a la Taj Mahal. What is cool is that every player will get something at the end of each auction, and getting something is not always good, in fact sometimes it is downright horrible. To make matters more interesting, in several of the auctions you can take a "risk" and push your luck to draw the cards you need from the draw deck rather than from your hand; this is the luck factor that some people are complaining about but I see it as another element of the game that has to be properly managed. The components are nice and the artwork is great, but the theme and gameplay don't mesh particularly well. I don't care because this is a really fresh take on the auction game!

This is a bidding game using cards (similar to Taj Mahal, but lighter in weight).  I enjoyed this game.  It doesn't seem like it would have a very high replayability value but I think it can be.  It can be a just as fun and replayable as Taj Mahal, and it doesn't over stay its welcome like Taj Mahal can sometimes.  Maybe I'm biased because it is a Knizia game and I tend to like his games alot.  I think Beowulf is a solid good game.  The board and components give the feel that it should be a heavy game and it really isn't.  In fact it is a hair lighter than most medium weight games.  I think that tends to disappoint people.  I like it though.  I always have fun playing it.

Most folks either love it or hate it.  I'm in the "love it" category.  The fixed sequence of events allows some long-term planning.  The individual auctions give a lot of room for tactical decisions, and they also offer subtle decisions.  Then there's the risking element that allows you to push your luck.  Great fun in my book.  

I speculate that most folks who don't like the game are turned-off by the combination of disparate elements.

Rating may improve with repeated plays. Clever little hand-management game with a simple auction mechanic. Risk option doesn't seem quite as unbalanced as many make it out to be. The board art, while lovely to look at, makes planning ahead a little more difficult than it needs to be - small (but fortunately identifiable) icons make it necessary to crane your neck to see more often than not. Slightly larger episode spaces (and icons) and less illustration would've made this entirely serviceable - as it stands, pretty to look at but impractical. Otherwise well done, but not a masterpiece.

There is definitely a gambler's element involved with this style of game.  I was left unimpressed thinking that the randomness of the Risk options plays *very heavily* on players/the game's end result.  Additionally, there's a good deal of randomness with the hidden Scrolls, ranging from low (1) to high (3) values.  I think that there is "some" strategy as one can easily "try" to plan ahead by looking along the track and plan for future cards needed, but one can not rely too much on one's hand for any duration (except maybe the last leg of the track) so you need to take the Risk challenges whenever appropriate or suffer scratches/wounds when coming in last and next to last at particular bids.  However, should one like gambling games (i.e. Manilla) then this just might be right up your alley.  The presentation and artwork and bits of this game is nice.

While its not as horrendous as some portray, I definitely find a preference to play Taj Mahal much more over this "risking" similar styled game.  The opportunity to risk cards really detracts from gameplay and strategic planning ahead in my book although obviously if you are better "suited" will aid you more.  Taj Mahal is the better choice with its cut-throat pokeresque play and knowing when to go all in or folding.

Fairly interesting game of resource management.  The "risk" element adds some tension and the bidding elements are nicely integrated.  Not terribly thematic but still provides some atmosphere with the artwork etc.  The card play has much of the feel of the cooperative LotR game to me, although everyone is obviously out for themselves here.

Bought this as an impulse buy from a FLGS closing down having only seem the box cover, figuring as I love mythology and that it had a 6.4ish rating on BGG it couldn't go wrong (at the time I did not know of Knizia's style of game). After reading the rules I realized this game was definitely not what I expected, and shelved it for some time before playing it recently. It is basically multiple rounds of press-your-luck + bidding (both secret and open) with lots of pit stops to restock on resources, and a pasted on theme. 

On one hand, this game was very easy to learn, yet offers some tough decisions of hand management and when you want to "risk" to get more cards (but risk taking scratches in the process), while having not bad components and artwork. On the other, I dislike how much getting lucky on card draws and alliance tokens affects the game, the game is almost too simple, and as stated before the theme is pasted on. Either way, take my rating with a grain of salt, as my disappointment that this wasn't some epic thematic game probably makes me quite biased.

EDIT: Well considering I occasionally feel like playing this I guess I can't rate it a 4 anymore. Mechanically it is alright even if I don't really like bidding where you lose your bid amount if you don't win. Some of the bidding events I think are more important to win than others (or are very quantized: e.g. being in the bottom 3 is really bad but doesn't matter if you are 1st or 2nd), which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The risking during the bidding events can be really swingy although I think I actually like the swinginess (and perhaps also why the losing your bid even if you don't win doesn't bother me that much) as it adds tension into what is otherwise a very dull, themeless game.

RATING: 9
This was a much-maligned game when it first came out.  The most common criticism was the "risk-off" problem, which is really a problem of bad play and not one of design.  I have found that this game punishes bad play much more severely than other Euros, which can often contain mechanisms that handicap good players.  There is no handicapping in Beowulf.  At its heart, it is a resource management game.  Careful planning and utilization of resources is the key to winning.  There are many tough choices as you must weigh which reward you want from an episode and how much you're willing to spend to get it.  Often, you must decide during an auction whether taking a less attractive reward is worth saving further bids.

In his heyday, of which this game is a part, Knizia layered so much subtlety into his games that their genius was sometimes difficult to grasp.  With Knizia's designs, don't mistake simplicity of design with simplistic game play.  Beowulf on first blush contains too much luck to allow for expert game play.  But good play requires knowing when to "risk" and when not to.  If that's not your cup of tea, then this game is probably not for you, but to say it is a "luck-fest" or "broken" is misinformed.

You play Beowulf's buddy in a game of hand-management auctions; this isn't the game you might have been expecting from the title.

This game should be right in your sweet spot if you like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, Knizia's LORD OF THE RINGS, or Kevin Wilson's ANDROID. These are all games that are structured around a linear narrative, where strategy consists in finding the best way to respond to plot events as they happen in sequence. What makes BEOWULF unique amongst them is that it's the only such game that uses an auction mechanism. This can make it feel a bit abstract and repetitive if you don't know the story, or if you do, but don't make the effort to imagine the prizes available to players at each step as appropriate given what Beowulf is doing at the time (e.g. fighting Grendel, traveling to Geatland, etc.) But anyone willing to make the extra mental effort should have a lot of fun and be quite stunned at Knizia's cleverness and originality here.

Don't have to be a fan of Beowulf as the theme is pasted on.
This is basically a light auction game that has a minor "push your luck" element (in the risks that one can take). On the other hand, I'm certain that we have in our library another Knizia auction game that play just as lightly and are equally (if not more) enjoyable. EX: Medici and Strozi

Plays with as few as 2.

Played half a game so far. My group judged it way random, but I think they misunderstood it - however, I'll play again with a more casual crowd, and then we'll see.

Raised to 8 after one more game. I have a high tolerance for randomness, as long as there is so much of it, that it evens out over the course of the game. And with that in mind, this turns out to be a great game, with interesting choices and a gambler feeling that I really enjoy.

A few games later: I insist on this being a great game ... if only anybody would play it with me :-/

Fun game of push your luck. Needs 5 people who are willing to have a laugh with it. It seems that the push your luck overrides all the card management and tactical choices, so ends up more of a light, luck based game than it might appear.

RATING: 6
"Too many stops and starts," says the Wife, and I reluctantly agree. I feel that somewhere in here is a really cool resource/hand management auction game, but the episodic play (while thematic) keeps Beowulf from being an immersive experience for us non-hardcore (softcore?) gamers. We just couldn't get into any flow.

I'm guessing that after several plays you become familiar with what's coming ahead on the board, and that familiarity would lend itself to strategic planning. But for us on our first few plays, there's too much to weigh and consider and not enough payoff. The episodic play is probably cool for experienced players because you're forced to manage your resources differently as the narrative progresses. For us inexperienced players, the narrative is a barrier to entry, as we can never quite get a strategic foothold.

I'd say this is for heavy gamers who'd like something lighter, rather than light gamers who'd like something heavier.

For a game that has 'push your luck' as a primary mechanic (which seemed to overshadow the auctions) it seems unnecessarily complicated for what it is.

A fun enough game. The board can be off-putting at first glance, making the game seem much more rule-heavy and complex than the game really is.

The game definitely works.  I have learned more about this very definitive Epic, which is really cool.  

The charts on the board are perhaps a bit too small, but the artwork by John Howe is again stunning.

The game is really a series of auctions with choices interspersed.  As such, it felt dry and therefore, I am slightly concerned about the longivity of this game, but maybe I am just being sceptical.  

Can't wait to try this again.  My rating will likely go up to a seven.

08/01/09 Played a five-player game, once. I look forward to playing it again, hopefully with the full compliment like today. Different from a lot of Reiner Knizia's games, this one had a *very* strong theme. The "L" shaped board was cute. But I think they should have gone with a square. They could have used that extra 25% surface area to enlarge the encounters. As it was we were all squinting at them, trying to decipher the tiny icons. The black stand up Beowulf sculpture added to this problem by always blocking someone's view of the encounter rewards at hand. I know I personally moved him at least a dozen times trying to see what was directly behind him (which then just blocked someone else's view). I blame these issues on the publisher, Fantasy Flight. They have a habit of sometimes over-producing their games. 

12/03/09 I obtained my own copy. The rule book is not organized very well. Oh, everything is there, but like things are strung out all over the place. 
01/26/10 Played a five-player game. 05/31/11 Another five-player game. 07/31/12 A four-player game. 05/13/14 Played a five-player game. 04/12/16 Played a five-player game.  04/18/17 Another five-player game.

  The game is good. Have to check out his other Beowulf game sometime.  

I like the idea of tying the game to the storyline, which Knizia did so well in LOTR.  It doesn't work as well here.  The bidding mechanic undermines the narrative -- it doesn't create the right kind of dramatic tension. Also, you need to play through the story track several times to get a feel for what a good move is.  Still, it's satisfying.

Oh, I so wanted to like this. After the first play, I was luke warm. One third of the way into the second play, I was hopeful, it looked like there might be some interesting and deeper hand management decisions than it originally seemed. Then, luck happened. I like luck in games. A lot. But, Beowulf has luck in the same (and only) place it has strategy and tactics: hand management. In addition to the luck of the draw, which is reasonably small and the usual factor in hand management games, it has the so called "risks", particularly during "major episodes" which are basically a magnified "luck of the draw". A good draw in a mid-episode risk is very beneficial. A bad draw in a mid-episode risk is very bad. If the luck were instead somewhere else, say in the selection of the order of the episodes, or in some other aspect of the game, it might not ruin it, but I think the potential variability of the swings of luck that so fundamentally and directly affect the core of the game eliminates too much of the impact of earlier decisions. At least I know I don't need another big box filling up shelf space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Oh man... there's something really good in there... hidden... somewhere... ! I can see the risk-management part but in the end the game is pretty much a die roll. Way too much randomness for my taste. Maybe I would enjoy it more if you were not allowed to extend yourself during the bidding, (only during the "discovery" phases or whatever they are called)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Forget the theme.  This is an auction game where the most cards played (of the chosen types) wins the auctions.  You continue most of the auctions until players drop out and take their place marker.  (So in a 5 player game the first person to drop out would take the 5 marker).  Then when the auction's over whoever won takes their pick of the available prizes.  Often the last place finishers are left with "prizes" that hurt them.  During the auctions players can choose to play cards until they are equal to the last bid or take a risk where two cards are drawn from the deck.  If the cards drawn match the suits of the auction they are added to the bid.  If neither of the cards match the suits then the player is out of the auction and takes a scratch.  Scratches add up to wounds and can give you negative points at the end of the game.  Many players will complain about the luck of the game but I see it more as a game of odds, choosing when to bow out of an auction and looking ahead at what cards the next auctions require.  Played quickly it's an alright game.

There's some strategy and interactivity in knowing how much to bid to beat the other players, and it can be fun if you role-play it a bit (friendship and beer!), but the decisions aren't all that deep. It also has a bit of a seating-order effect. The luck of the deck draw isn't huge, but enough to tilt the game. If I play again I'll make more of an effort to be in first place before the recuperate rounds to get first pick of the laid-out cards.

A bad game that is less than the sum of its parts. It seems like it should be a better game, but strategy and careful planning is easily overwhelmed by lucky card draws. In my one and only play of this game, I trailed the entire game and won on the very last round just by getting lucky card draws. You don't have to be good at this game to win, you just have to survive to the last round without having taken too many wounds, in which case you've got just as much of a chance of winning as anyone else at the table. Which means, of course, that the entire hour or so leading up to that last round is a complete waste of time. You might as well save yourself some time and just roll a die to determine the winner.

Good family game. The card play is vaguely similar to that of Taj Mahal but this game is much easier to learn and play.  Success in this game is all about picking your battles.  In other words, knowing when to concede defeat immediately and when to use the bulk of your cards to win top prize.  Offers some good decisions but a bit weak thematically.  I never truly got the sense that I was helping Beowolf go to battle.

Not sure what to make of this.  Great reviews from all the right people, but my game tonight just seemed like a luck-fest.  Ever read a great novel that's the toast of the town that you don't think is special, but you've got a gnawing feeling you're missing something?  Curiosity will lead to more replays, I'm sure.

UPDATE:  Bought it, because I think there's a gem under the hood.  Now, just gotta get that hood open...

I like the flow of this game. Since you already know what lies ahead, you have to plan where you're going to fight and how much you're willing to commit. There is a lot of luck involved when taking risks, but I find it quite enjoyable.

RATING: 6.5
Reminds me a lot of Taj Mahal, another Knizia title that I really enjoy. Beowulf is a bit more random but faster than Taj Mahal. The most annoying (or fun) thing about Beowulf is that using the Risk option removes the motive to develop a strong hand of cards. However, all this makes for a good gateway game due to its relatively simple ruleset and speed of play.

I really like this game.  Don't expect anything too special, but it's fun, challenging and has plenty of "push you luck" moments.  Our group seem to like it.  A game that's certainly better after a couple of playes when you know how and when to preserve or spend resources.

Just remember; don't get bogged down in a bidding war!

Despite the fact that this game almost goes out of its way to be anti-thematic, this is an excellent Knizia title. It's an interesting combination of his Lord of the Rings cooperative game, Modern Art, and Taj Mahal, all wrapped up into a game that attempts to tell the story of Beowulf in a very abstracted way. It doesn't seem like it would work, but it does. As long as you're not expecting epic battles with cinematic moments, I think there's a lot to appreciate here. Just realize going in that this is an auction game of risk management and hand management. The rule book tries to give thematic reasoning behind each auction, but it's almost laughable at how much of a stretch most of them are. Still, this is a very fun game, mechanically-speaking, and one that I reacquired after initially being lukewarm on it.

The biggest problem I see with this game is that it is story-based, so those who have played the game before can have an advantage setting up for the finish. With newer players, I take pains to emphasize the end of the track, and what will be needed to survive it.  All that being said, I like the game.

RATING: 7
Warriors of Beowulf compete against each other in this Knizia design of the epic poem. In some battles, players play cards to stay in the battle, but they also have the option to "risk" and draw cards from the deck to match required symbols. There is an approximate 1/4 chance of failure, and 3/4 chance of succeeding, allowing you to stay in the battle, otherwise you take a "scratch", with 3 scratches equalling a wound. Other battles are a blind bid of cards against others. Gold is also used for bidding. Good game allowing one to push their luck, and manage risks. Some decisons in the game are extremely tense, deciding whether to risk or face off against an opponent. I think there is a lot of luck, but that is the nature of the game. You shouldn't lose any sleep on the risk decisions you make, but I have seen games where people hardly fail at all or come up with double symbol cards that help their cause. Fun, with lots of groaning.

RATING: 4.3
Like other Euro-y games, Beowulf: The Legend has easy to learn mechanics that allow for huge amounts of skill and strategies to develop and unfold. Like the Beowulf movie game and other Euro games, the theme is largely painted on, but better to have a painted on theme than none at all. The gameplay is fast-paced, fun, and a great example of a push-your-luck, risk-management, and bluffing-tactics game. People who suffer from gambler's fallacy are sure to do poorly in this lovely underrated game.
Like all of Fantasy Flight's games, the quality, components, and art is fantastic.

UPDATE: The more I think about this game, the less I feel like playing it. Yes, it's a cool auction mechanic but it probably shouldnt be an auction game with the theme. The art is good but other than that it is quite bland. The theme doesn't fit, I don't think I like this type of game as much as I told myself I would like it. It's just not exciting or something I would often feel like pulling out. As a result, I got rid of it. Another Knizia game that seems well designed but is just not all that engaging.

If you enjoy the thrill of Lady Luck turning the fire hose on you and then giving your opponents exactly what they need through a random card draw, then boy oh boy, is this game for you.  I'm astounded that a designer as experienced and as generally reliable as Reiner Knizia unleashed this filth.  As in Settlers of Catan, cards are required to do anything, yet the distribution of cards is totally luck-based.  Every time there's a "Risk" episode, you can flip two cards over.  If neither of them matches what's needed, then not only do you suffer, but you've also made it more likely that another player WON'T suffer.  Then the players compete to earn rewards or avoid setbacks in a play-or-bail situation, not unlike the vastly superior Taj Mahal, and if you've repeatedly been screwed in the drawing process, then you simply can't compete with the other players.  Not only can you not win, you can't even participate.  No luck = no cards = no game.

RATING: 9
Rating after one play - expected to rise.  Beowulf features control, controlled risk, and outright risk - knowing when to exercise each is the key to success.  People seem quick to draw a comparison between this and Knizia's LotR due to the art and the story-to-game theme, but Taj Mahal is clearly a much closer relative to the mechanics.

--Update--
Still at 7.  The press-your-luck element adds the bulk of the tension, but can also lead to blow outs if someone benefits clearly more than others.  That's not necessarily a bad thing - it's the nature of the beast.

Update - bumped up a point.  Starting to play the hand management and risk management aspects a bit more now.  The problem is I'm still losing :)  But at least now I'm losing with a plan.  Now I just need to refine the plan.
----
Update - bumped up again.  There is just a lot more there than there seems at first, and though it really shines with 5 it has proven to be quite nice with 4 or even 3.  Every game I've played of this lately has resulted in at least five minutes of post-game discussion breaking down the different decision points that turned things for one player or another.  Knizia has designed a brilliant game (again) that, unfortunately, seems to be dismissed due to people not having faith that there can be more than just luck at play here.

RATING: 5
Linear mid-weight game based on Beowulf's story.  Very similar to Lord of the Rings in several aspects but not a co-operative game at all.  Luck can be a decisive factor in certain plays throughout the game via "risking" for cards, but it's not that big a deal.  I have more problems with the sacrifice of theme for gameplay's clarity with cards named "All-Iron Shield" and "Hrunting Sword" having axes as the displaying artwork.

Game feels a bit luck heavy. I wound up winning by risking on the dragon attack event and taking five points. I also picked up ten more from the last event and not having any wounds, but during the game it didn't really seem like I was in contention. I didn't have an excess of cards for most of the game, but I managed to avoid the worst events (no wounds, few scratches). I'd play again, but it seems pretty heavy on the luck if you risk a lot.

RATING: 5
Seems more complicated at first sight than it is. There are many, many auctions and lots of chances for taking risks and pushing your luck. Felt a surely ok game but not a great one. There is a lot of luck involved because of so many places where you can earn extra cards just by drawing them luckily from the deck. Not for serious gaming.

Rules are written in a way it's very hard to find something you want. For example a setup for the game.

A linear game of hand management. Looks a lot like Knizia's LOTR. Based on linearity, components, LOTRish artwork, and most of the mechanics, I'd say this is just another six. But, the game is a lot of fun; mostly because of player reactions to the effects of the risk taking mechanism. That really works.

The graphic design concentrates too much on John Howe's fantasy drawings, and on the gimmick of an unusually shaped board. Meaning, usability is left to the background; The actual game-related graphics on the board are a bit too small.

Terrific design. A competitive, risk-taking game based on the Beowulf mythology. I like it even more than "Lord of the Rings," which I like very much.

The risk/reward press-your-luck aspect just irritates me more with every playing, especially when the cost of losing can be so overwhelming. I think it may be one of the games where the less you care about the result, the better you'll do. It's certainly more enjoyable if you invest nothing into the need to win, happy to go along for the ride, get into the theme and be satisfied taking what destiny gives.

Well, this isn't his best, BUT I must say that [b]Knizia's focus here was to honor the story, which I believe he has done well.[/b] This is a quality game, with wonderful art by John Howe, nice components, and an unique board, all done to present a special gaming experience submerged in the story. The game mechanisms are minor hand management, and auctions. The hand management in this game reminds me of a lighter version of that in Knizia's Lord of the Rings coop.

This game is best with the advanced rules and the rulebook variant.

Although some of the ideas are very obviously taken from the lord of the rings game from the same author, this is one of my favourite Knizia games. Risk management and hand management combine for a very tense gaming experience that does have a slight poker feel to it. Gorgeous illustrations by Jon Howe and beautiful board design.

- The rule book is well structured, although there are one or two points that are not too clear and might result in some misinterpretation. Otherwise, quickly learned and easily explained. Easy to grasp despite challenging game-play.

I really, really enjoy this game.  I think the mechanics work well and (while abstract) the theme somehow carries through.  It's an easy game to learn and a difficult game to master, which really is just about all you can ask from a good game.  It also replays well and has rules that scale nicely with more players.  More is definitely better here, though, since your choices become more complicated and the competition for "the good stuff" more intense.

It has a brutal hand management quality: if you try to win too many, you will lose many.  You have to pick your battles. I suspect there is also an aspect of turning adversity to your advantage, but I'm not sure.  If so, that is the thing that would make this game a masterwork.

This auction game felt a little like Taj Mahal--but not too much.  I thought the bidding system where you tried to stay in as long as you could was pretty fun.  Unfortunately, the "risk" spaces added a ton of luck to the game, which detracted a lot for me.  In the end, I really liked how the game felt, I just wish there weren't so much luck.

 This is a pretty good push your luck game. You can take risks, but to do so you use up cards or take wounds (worth negative points.)

After playing it 5 times in 1 evenng, I must admit, CF was right.  The game grows on you... the luck comes into play sometimes, but that's part of the games charm.

The amount of fun that you get out of a one hour game of Beowulf: The Legend gives almost any other game a LITERAL run for their money.  Possibly Reiner's most under-rated design.

I enjoy every play of this.  The trick, I think, is to find the inefficiencies in the way your fellow gamers play and exploit them, and to plan ahead to give yourself the best chance to avoid the big hits (such as the two wound blast near the end and a couple other issues as things come up).  That said, the best one can do is to hedge one's bets.  It's a game of drawing cards, and a long run of luck can let someone get the victory.  Still, though, there are so many Risk draws (at least two or three times as many draws as there are combat rolls in a game like Pirate's Cove) that they probably even out over the game, and each player has to evaluate the importance of the draws against the relative risk.  Plus, one of my plays was guided by disclamer, who told the story of Beowulf as we progressed, adding to the flavor.

Several playings of this "final?" instalment of Knizia's "Trilogy of Narrative Tracks" (Rings and Marco Polo being the other two), and I can't think of any auction game I've played over the years with this much sitcom and tension; the cause of these experiences is the "Blackjack" style card flips when taking risks. This emotional element alone gives me the desire to play again, despite some initial lacklustre playings (introduce the advance money rule ASAP, as this add more interest in  picking treasures and the cashup at game end provides a hopeful catchup in fame). There is some subtlety in decisions and card counting to determine your hand strength in various "episodes" and when to exert or throw in the towel. I also feel the game play and theme works too. Despite the linear fixed feel, there is replayability as I gradually pick up the subtleties and make better calculations.
Update: Unfortunately, this hit the trade pile because in the end it is difficult to think back over the adventure as to where you went wrong or did well.

Beowulf has some of the bluffing and brinksmanship of Taj Mahal, but without the spatial elements. I really like the 'risk' system which allows you to push your luck and can inspire groans and curses around the table. The different rewards and penalties you are competing for are nicely difficult to value and the game rattles along. Yes, we found it amusing that Knizia turned an epic poem into an auction game, but there's actually a subtle theming under the surface, relating to the bragging and machismo of the Geatish heroes.

Really fun push you luck game.  I've only played with 5 players.  It looks like it may lose some of it's urgency with less.  Luck can definitly play a roll in who wins and loses this game.  In one game I played everyone had dropped out of the last battle save me an one other player.  We kept taking risks (i.e. drawing cards) because we had already played out everything in our hands and the game was almost over.  We took turns drawing until my opponent failed to draw a good card and thus was the winner determined.  I thought it was a lot of fun, but you know if you're the type of gamer that would enjoy this type of result in a game.

I just don't particularly like Knizia's designs. My opinion is based on my personal tastes in games; the others who played it quite liked it (and as a result, I played this game twice in a row, and ruined any positive opinion I ever had of this game).

It's a typical Knizia game:
* Different ways to score: Part of the strategy of a typical Knizia game is to try to determine how to balance what to score, and when. Typically, every possibility to score is included in the game, and it feels that the bulk of the design involved tweaking the scoring system. I personally don't like games in which I have to focus on the scoring system over the core mechanics of the game, and I don't like the feeling I get that the smoothness of the game is due to the carefully tweaked scoring system, not the core mechanics of the game.

* Taj Mahal match-the-symbol auction, without the open card drafting: I just really did not enjoy this mechanic at all. I prefer my auctions wide open (almost like Goa), not as restrictive as the ones here. I'm not particularly fond of resource management games in general, especially when the resources don't "feel" like resources.

* Pasted-on theme. When you're constantly making jokes about fisting whenever you play a fighting card, you know the theme isn't working that well. Perhaps a board with much larger playing spaces so you can actually read the text on the spaces would make it feel you're fighting significant battles.

Pros: Less painful than Lord of the Rings. Light enough so that I don't have to pay much attention while playing. Very quick turns and low downtime, though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Typical Knizia...abstract game with pasted on theme. The Beowulf theme barely saves this one.  Even then, it's a tough sell.  It's basically a trick game, where you collect suits of cards to be used to bid for favor and treasure.  It's not immediately clear what the strategy is, and it does play out somewhat randomly at first as what you can play is solely determined by the cards in your hand.   I suppose the strategy lies in knowing when to save your cards and when to play them, but you'll need to go through the game a few times to figure that out.  This is NOT Lord of the Rings, which is thematically richer and cooperative, so ignore the comparisons.

I find the card mechanics remind me of the Great Dalmuti in reverse, and that the board font and layout to be rough on a newcomer.  In a two player game, it was easy for a player to keep a card advantage on the underdog and ride that advantage to victory, even though the turn order indicator often landed with the underdog to have the first shot at the top spot in the pecking order on the next event.  Without cards, it didn't matter.  I still liked it. it should play faster once I become more familiar with the game, and and find a more opponents for it. could have been a 8 or 9 with some more interesting mechanics.

I've never played a game that polarised our gaming group so much. Some of us (i.e. me) loved it. Others (i.e. the four others) hated it. Some of the comments wouldn't make good quotes on the back of the box: "Really crap, I hated it", "Worse theme of any game I've played", "Complete luck and I wouldn't play again", etc.

Yes, it is very light and yes there's luck. But it's meat & veg Knizia, with an emphasise on risk and the draw rather than cerebal decision making. Perhaps designed during his poker phase? I really liked the simplicity of it all, and the theme works to an extent. FFG fans were probably disappointed though. This is no FFG Ameritrash game. The theme is totally abstracted, it's a simple story arc that could have been applied to ANY quest, and the components are perhaps a little too lush for such a simple game. But I love ya Bewulf, even if I'll struggle to find anyone to play it with again!

Dr. K is a genius.  He's just recycled his 'Lord of the Rings' game for competitive players and it works.

Seriously, this game is very underrated.  It plays well, and is just a huge amount of fun.

RATING: 7
Good looking game following the story of Beowulf. All players are his companions & compete to be the most useful on each of the trials he faces. This is done through a series of bidding rounds with the winners gaining victory points or other benefits whilst the losers suffer potential point-losing wounds. Nice 'risk' option allows some luck pushing.
Seems to play well with 2, better with more!

I've used this with my students during SUMMER SCHOOL with good results. Attach "game" to a lesson plan and they forget they're in an academic environment. Great for getting the names and major plot elements across to a reluctant readership!   I own several copies.

Tight bidding game. Play with the advanced rules. It's a fun kind of stressful trying not to take wounds. One might think it would be hard for the Beowulf theme to show through the simple card play, but inexplicably, it works fairly well.

Mildly interesting game of hand management and push-your-luck. Has blind-bidding elements from the designer's Tower of Babel which I like better in that game, and card play elements from the designer's Lord of the Rings which I don't much like in either game. Helen detests it altogether.

Taj Mahal meets Lord of the Rings - interesting game of pressing your luck and card management.  The system can get slightly repetitive during the game.  There is a pretty good luck factor to the game since the ability to get new cards is based partly on a random draw element.  Nevertheless, there are some good moments throughout the game that keep you engaged.  The game has moved up in my ratings from a 5 to 6 on a second play, but I'm worried about the wild swing that the scrolls can provide - I look forward to trying it again at some point.

I played it a couple of more times and it's moved up for me again.  B:TL is quick and has good decisions to be made.  It's a fun game and I look forward to playing it from time to time.

Kind of ridiculously great fun. It's Taj Mahal, unravelled, rolled out into a sequential path, and with goofy push-your-luck stuff going on. I love it. The first time I played, my buddy and I were in miserable moods and by the end we'd been talking in silly French accents for no reason at all and screaming at each other to take the fucking risk, asshole.

Kind of weirdly magical for what seems like a klunky system.

UPDATED: Downgraded from an 8 to a 7. Slick design, but after about 5 plays, it's a teeny bit boring.

All auctions all the time!  Game presents an arc of card play through a variety of "locations" but that really is about it.  I found the game to be repetitive and unengaging with very little player interaction (despite the fact it was an auction game).  Did win my first game by getting lucky on a few risk draws at events that let me stay in and win the bidding gaining a 7VP and a 5VP chit.  Where's the skill in that?  A game I might play if offered up by others, but see no reason to add to my own collection.

When playing the game, I could see the genesis of some of the ideas in Knizia's Lord of the Rings game.  But thinking back, I like the LOTR game more because of the flavour text on the events as well as the multiple paths.  Of course, that is a cooperative game which probably helps.  Here players are each assisting Beowulf trying to be his successor at the end of the game.

RATING: 9
Wonderful game, featuring a well-integrated theme, tension, strategy, tactics, gambling and less luck than some would claim. I love the way Knizia has taken to using a story-line, as in LotR and, originally, Die Kaufleute von Amsterdam. After a game I really feel as though I've been involved in an adventure, with all its highs and lows. Always play with the so-called "advanced" rules.

After reading the rules I figured that this game would be a decent amount of fun. Having picked it up for $5 from FFG monster sale, I finally gave it a try. The game didn't let me down with what I expect. It's not very deep, but it is a game where you have to analyze what you expect a player is doing and what they're going to do. 

It's a very simple game. Sounds complex when you're going over the rules, but when you're actually playing the game, everything makes perfect sense and nothing is just too overly overwhelming when you get the hang of it.

Perhaps the most underrated game in Knizia's auction game catalog. It gets blasted for supposedly having too much luck. Sure, it has some luck, but most of it is manageable. Compare that to a game like Thebes, where almost all the luck (and there is A LOT of it) is completely unmanageable.

The theme nearly hits the mark, and adds a lot of atmosphere to the experience, while vaguely evoking the overall story arcs of the epic poem.

My biggest irk is the shape of the board. I guess the design is supposed to mimic the three parts of the story, but it does that at the sake of functionality. Adding the missing part of the board, and enlarging the graphics would have been a much better decision. 

If you've had any enjoyment with a previous Knizia auction games, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up, which can be found dirt cheap with very little effort.

--Feb2006-- (After one play.)  Theme doesn't seem quite as strong as I might have expected.  The game is amusing, though; a strange light-ish mixture of familiar mechanisms from Lord of the Rings and Taj Mahal, but somewhat more random than either.  The Risk mechanism (nothing to do with the well-known game of the same name) isn't at all out of place, but the game is pretty light with its inclusion.  I think I'd be willing to play again, but I'm not clamouring to buy it.

Yet another interesting auction game from R. Knizia.  While the theme isn't particularly strong on this one, the art work and abridged story that can be narrated throughout the auctions helps to tie it to the game well enough.  After several plays I can say that the infamous push-your-luck element of the game actually helps it's replay value.

After one play, one can't help but exclaim "Knizia made this?!" The game is total chaos. OK, not total chaos, but a very large luck factor. Anyway, the game is actually pretty fun, all the random luck results in lots of exciting situations where you pull cards off the top of the deck hoping to get the right ones. Its a bit silly of course, because its all luck.
Further analysis shows that the game is actually really well balanced and designed, Knizia just can't help himself, even if he tries to make a game with high luck factor. Of course, its all meaningless balance in the face of the total chaos.

This has to be the greatet family game ever published. I can teach the rules in less than 5 minutes, there's a good deal of randomness to keep mostly everybody in contention, and the theme is fantastic (that a rare thing to say about a Knizia!). There's enough to keep (most) gamers happy: resource management, meaningful decision making, even planning ahead. And there's something I've missed the first few times: coalitions against a leading and/or strong player are important to play this game well. 
Recommended variant: risks always mean a scratch, but you get to reveal (and keep up to) 3 cards.

Beowulf deserved so much better than bargain-bin obscurity. It has many of the same qualities as other Knizia games, especially Ra, Taj MAhal,  and Lord of the Rings.

Engaging auction game. Lots to think about and enjoy. The auctions are varied enough that it doesn't feel like we keep just doing the same thing over and over again. Bluffing, card management, auctions using different currencies - all good elements that keep it fresh during an evening.

You'll be pushing your luck and working out where it's worthwhile taking a good risk and where it's not. Players who like to take risks all the time (and discover that they can't win them all), will be inevitably disappointed and will have missed the point. You have to choose where you need to win and where you don't, and even then you'll need contingency plans because you can't win all those you think you need. In that respect it's a great resource management game.

It's a bonus if you ever studied the poem and you can follow the story along. Of all the Knizia games I think it's the best themed one of the bunch.

So far only played with 2 and 3 players, which works OK. I can see that it would certainly be better with more players and best with the full contingent of 5. Beowulf is a fairly light-weight game, which is fun to play. It involves card and risk management, with some ability to plan ahead. If you're looking for something deep and complex, you'll be disappointed. But it fits very well into the "less serious" game niche.

Beneath the incredible prdoction value, the great artwork, and quality bits lies a game of pedestrian proportions.  There's nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere.  It's essentially an auction game.  I'm sure Beowulf went up to Grendel and decided to auction a few cards back and forth to see who dies.  Yeah, right.

I bought this several years ago. Played once and just didn't get it back to the table for a long time. Finally played it twice (two player) in the last week or so and wow, it's so much fun. It helped that we like the theme, but it's just a nice and easy game to play (once you translate the rules) and the risks are fun. With that said, the risk can take over the game or this would be a higher rating.

I actually enjoyed this game a lot more than I ever would have expected.  I had resisted playing it for some unknown reason.  There was just something about it that I didn't think I would like.  I was wrong.  It has some set collection because at every spot on the board you are trying to win auctions with different suits, with misfortune usually befalling the losers of said auctions.  The key is not to try to win every auction, but rather not to lose certain ones that could cripple you.  It was fun and I would play it again.

I have not really played this enough to come to a really solid opinion of the game given all of the negative (and positive) press it has received.  I have been working to take care of that, but for whatever reason, my gaming circumstances have not cooperated.  Still, my initial feeling is that it is not as bad a many make it out to be.  The risking was not overly dominant and the player who risked the most (and pretty indisciminantly) ended up losing pretty badly.  For what it is worth, it seems pretty thematic.  Still, I understand why there are some who are unhappy with this.  To each his own.  Now if I can just coax someone else into a game.  [06/21/2008]

Played once; four-player.  Play felt very mechanical.  Theme did not feel integrated.  Like Knizia's Lord of the Rings, players must play required cards to pass a challenge, but in Lord of the Rings, the theme dominates, making any "mechanical feel" a minor issue.  This felt like the game was playing itself, with only some variability provided by the players.

First-play mark, but with everybody else having played at least once so rules were a straight-forward immersion rather than book-wrestling - which I think I would;d have struggled with!

Superb game. Like all Kniza games, the them is completely pasted on. But the Howe artwork helps make up for the lack of theme. Howe should provide art for more games!

Yes, the symbols are a tad tiny and rulebook is really pretty shite (poor explanations etc). It needs a glossary to explain all the symbols.

But the push your luck element works well and you have to pick your battles. The advance treasure rules adds yet another bidding element to the whole shebang and probably makes it a tighter, better game.

It plays fairly quick (1 hour) and is an above average Kniza auction game.

Hand Management, Auction/Bluffing. Rating after one 4p play. All of us really enjoyed it. Another example of a solid Knizia game that is deceptively thematic: yes, it's just an auction game, but the journey and the wounds and fame and treasure all combine to work for us. We found the risk mechanic a lot of fun, and there were definitely times when it was truly risky to use it versus playing it safe and accepting that you couldn't afford to use it to try continuing an auction. :thumbsup: x4.

Update: still enjoy this after several more plays.

Update: I learned and played Ivanhoe several times at BGGcon 2009. Thinking about it now, I think Beowulf is a slightly beefier game built on the Ivanhoe engine, which may explain why I like them both.

Traded despite my appreciation for the game. Too much competition for my playtime and shelf space.

A Knizia push-your-luck game of mini-auctions telling the story of Beowulf. A good enough game for a few play-throughs, but I felt like retelling the same story over and over again didn't have much replayability. You could play the game just for the mechanics but if I wanted to play an auction game, I would much rather play "Modern Art" or if I wanted to play push-your-luck, I would go for a quick "Coloretto".

RATING: 4
I'm absolutely sure that there are some significant decisions to make in this game, but most of them are seriously overwhelmed by luck.  There is such a derth of cards in the game, that it just doesn't seem feasable to not take a risk, so after a while it becomes matter of fact and you either win or lose.  While I'm certainly not a huge fan of overwhelmingly lucky games, I can enjoy them, but the problem with Beowulf is that it just runs WAY too long for what it is.  So many auctions.  To add to the luck there are a couple blind bids thrown in as well. Hmmm.

Everything works here, but none of it really works for me.  I'm sure if I were to invest the time to understand the ways to finagle the available situations on the Beowulf movement track this game would be more rewarding, but then I'm just putting in even more effort to be determined by the draw of the deck.  

Perhaps if the game length were an hour shorter I might think this was fun, but as is it is just long and tedious.

Way too long and random, without too many serious decisions.  I would like to think of it as a lighter Taj Mahal, since you do collect cards, but the problem here is that most of the time, your cards are acquired by Risk actions, which are obvious choices and the lucky grab what you get.  It ultimately ends up being more a long press-your-luck fest which would be fine if it were 30 minutes, but at 90, it's totally not worth it.

Going through the rules, this seemed like it was going to be really boring. Surprisingly, it was actually kind of fun! The theme felt very pasted-on but it was still a nice game of card/hand management. We didn't play with the advanced rules, which will probably make the game better.

Similar to LOTR in the types and uses of cards, but not cooperative so your particular hand actually matters, and you can see what your needs will be well in advance so you can do a bit of planning. 

A 6-7 after one play, but I don't feel the need to own this one.

Got new in shrink at yard sale for $5.
Components are quality cardboard, sturdy mounted map board in a strange L-shape with a large shield that is placed at the L's 90-degree angle, with no apparent reason. Cards are decent, Beowulf figure used for recording game progress is OK.

Rules are laid out a bit wonky. You're told how to start playing the game and walked through the first turn before being told what you are trying to accomplish and what the victory conditions are.

Three plays to date, all 2-player; would seem to be better with more players as 2 doesn't give much variety for encounter results.

Original auction game which runs through a series of scripted 'adventures' in which players bid for good things or to avoid bad. Risk and resource managed Knizia style at the lighter end of the spectrum. Hugely entertaining push yer luck elements. Despite the it being dry as a bone them wise this provides an entertaining 60 minutes

I've only played with 1 other player, so I'd like to see how it works for 3+ players. Going to say 8/10 for now. 

(edit) Played a few times with 4 players, very good stuff. Needs at least 4 players to be interesting, meant for 5 really, but I'm thinking that 5 might be too much.

RATING: 8
Of all Knizia's medium-heavy games, Beowulf is one of the heaviest, together with Taj Mahal. With Taj Mahal, it also shares that poker feeling in the auctions: stop now and cut your losses, or proceed and risk winning or losing everything? The risks have sometimes been maligned for introducing too much luck, but I think it's more a question of knowing which ones to take and which ones to pass than simply drawing cards and hope for the best. If anything, they add a lot of excitement.
Haven't played this enough to rate this a 10 yet, but I may well upgrade my rating with further plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beowulf is a curious game, in that a great deal of attention was paid to the theme when the components were put together (card names, locations on the track, etc.) but virtually none of it leaked through into the game play itself. One feels more like an accountant than a warrior when playing, despite all the artwork and terminology involved. Still, a decent game if you like abstracts. Just don't look here if you're wanting to play out an adventure.

[6 plays] I have had fun time with this game so far.  The auction system seems cool and it was pretty easy to grasp, the game takes the right amount of time to play.  I can see where it has luck of the draw.  There can be pretty big swings in the game depending on card draw, more so than I usually would like.  In a few games it did seem like one player or another did get screwed by luck of the draw.  But most of the players were neck and neck and it was a super close and exciting finish.  So that makes it fun to play it again.  It seems that in most games for most players the "luck" will roughly balance out over the course of the game, but in some exceptions a player or game could get off just because of the luck of the draw.  This will mean this game is in that good/very good range, but not quite great.

4/16/10: Decent auction/risk-taking game that has some aesthetic similarities to Lord of the Rings (the co-op), but little else in common.  My game was 4p and was decent but felt a little lighter than I expected; I'm hoping that with 5p it would be a bit tighter.  As it stands, my concerns are that: clockwise auctions seem to largely come down to someone winning a absurdly large Risk pull of 3-4 symbols, and that Risks rarely seem NOT worth taking, especially with the many opportunities to void one's scratches.  I suspect some of this was unfamiliarity with the game--I think we tended to go whole-hog into many auctions without thinking about what lay ahead and what our priorities were, and we didn't know the relative worth of prizes.  That said, I will say that it felt somewhat unique and interesting enough that I want to give it another couple go-rounds.

One major complaint outside of gameplay, though.  I love the 3-sided board, that's really aesthetically interesting.  But why in the name of all that is holy is everything related to the game so freaking TINY on it?  I understand wanting to leave room for the neat art, but when we feel tempted to bust out some old-grandparent reading glasses to make out icons, something has gone wrong in the graphic design department.

What an awesome variation on Taj Mahal.  There's a considerable amount of luck but I find that it makes for really memorable moments.  I love the hand management aspect of the game and how it greases the wheels at the cost of taking risks.  It's a great design that is really tense.  I think this has become a new favorite amongst Knizia games for me, but I likely won't play it much as the game really wants 4 players at minimum, just like Taj.

RATING: 8
Played 3  times.  In Beowulf, you are a team of Beowulf's followers and you are vying to succeed Beowulf when he dies. This is played out in a series of auctions and events on a track leading to the dragon battle and finally Beowulf's death.  You have hand management and planning, risk management and out right risk.  When to use each is an extremely important part of the game.  I think this game is great and includes elements of auctions and push-your-luck.  Definitely requires more playings. 2008/1/1

RATING: 7
I enjoyed it the one afternoon we played it; but gee there's so much more potential here for a band of brothers to work their way through an adventure. POsitives: rules are very clean; time frame is very appropriate (an hour or less for a nice adventure). However the strategic thinking involved starts to annoy me; it is not about joining in a quest and how this gang will stay together or fall apart. You have to analytically start to work out what you will do in the next few moves and how you will use your cards. WIth a few steps to go, you've got a more or less mathemtical plan. I really wish you could not see what adventure was coming next and this would really mess with the psychology of flight or flee as well as how to manage your hand. THe game works well for what it is, I'm just disappointed in what it could be. The main criticism would be the type of thinking involved: it is more mathematical/linear rather than psyschological. That and the lack of much drama which is what I want in a game like this.

Another classic Knizia game. Essentially it is a hand management game with a push your luck aspect (as so many of the faster playing Knizia's are). It does what it does very well, has a very pretty board (with a slightly jarring graphic design), decent art on the cards and enough meaningful decisions and hidden information to make the game fun to play. Recommended!

I like this game I really do, but I have come to accept its flaws - it has a large degree of luck, and the best player is not necessarily the most most likely winner! However it's a good romp through a good story (how many of us have actually read it - not I sadly), with the theme kind of sticking on okay :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice theme and interesting mechanics. Luck factor is a little on the heavy side, though. Despite the heavy luck element (and all the whining it inevitably engenders), the game is incredibly balanced (typical Knizia!), with the scores usually bunched together at the end. I'm not quite sure why, but this game appeals to me, where many games with similar high-luck mechanics don't. Again, perhaps it's because, as with many Knizia games, there's plenty players to can do to plan ahead and mitigate the luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game takes a while to play (2 hours for 5 players), but is engaging throughout. Very tough decisions throughout make this another outstanding Knizia game that combines elements from some of his other games in a new way (Taj Mahal, Hollywood Blockbuster). Have only played 5-player, but probably plays well with 3 or 4 too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are few Knizia titles where the theme feels more pasted-on then Beowolf. Essentially, the only tie-in to the literary work is the labeling of less than half of the spaces on the board. The game could be about anything. It's an okay title with the high-drama car flips being the most interesting part.   There's a LOT of luck.

The risks are tense.  It is an ok game.   It is kind of a platypus in game play.  There is planning, auctions, measuring relative strength against one opponents, but at the same time there is luck, pure randomness, and chaos which can undo any and all planning.  The card play auction system with the risk assessment is fantastically designed, but it is undone by the randomness in the variable points and gold provided by the rewards.  The risk assessment alone with perfect information rewards would be a great game, or removing the risks to have unknown values under the chits would be an ok game.  Combining the two seems to undo a brilliant and clever idea.  It has a fair amount of rules and I'd only feel comfortable playing with gamers, however games with this little control I'd prefer with family members and non-gamers.  This game frustrates me so.  I like the concept, and I really should enjoy myself when I play this.  It ends up being fun for a bit and drives me nuts for the rest.  Will play occasionally if someone mentions it.  

I wish the hockey theme was there.  You place your hockey pucks.  There are goalie masks, hockey sticks, delayed penalties, sounding the horn with a goal being scored, and the roadtrips are the sailboats.  I guess Knizia is a big Phoenix Coyotes fan as well.... or maybe he owed money to Rick Tocchet and that is how they settled their debt.

My biggest issue is the times I have played (3 times) 2 players would play the odds, pick their spots to risk and the others would just push their luck constantly.  One of the 3 players would have an incredible luck streak which would cause them to win.  2nd or 5th place don't matter, I want the W, so my strategy must shift to hope to get lucky with the risks.  That will raise my over winning percentage to 25% instead of 0%.  Hence, the fifth player should defect from their "pick your spots" strategy and its basically become a game of LCR but significantly longer and false pretenses.

This game relives the legend of how the Geatish warrior Beowulf comes to the aid of the Danish King against the fearsome monster Grendel, how he returns to his home in Geatland to become King, and how Beowulf meets his end when fighting the terrible dragon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hard to rate.  A great 2 player auction game.  But it's not really an auction, it's just a card game.

I love the idea of having all the auctions laid out in front of you.  You are aware of what you will be bidding on for the entire course of the game and must manage currencies.  You are aware of when and where you will be able to fill your hand.  There is a very cool and intricate game within this that gives a ton of long term strategy revolving around which auctions you plan to forfeit, which ones you MUST win, and which ones you want to push opponents to waste extra cards on to make them overpay.  This is all awesome, especially with 2 players.  And it scales well!

Something is lost however.  Maybe it's the ability to draw the cards to try and win an auction?  This luck of the draw seems at odds with the rest of the game... That is, if all the auctions are laid out with perfect information, why ruin it by letting you draw cards during the auctions?  It seems to diffuse the tension and it's unrewarding when you succeed in drawing a card that you need.

I'm not sure.  I would keep it for two, but at some point, why not just play MU?

Considering its rating on BGG, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. Sure, it is a bit of an undercover Knizia-style auction game, it involves a fair amount of luck and there is also a bit of guessing & bluffing (an element I do not really care for in games). The endresult is, however, more than the sum of its components as far as I am concerned.
Not sure where the added value comes from, but the great atmospheric components & artwork, the low amount of downtime, the strategic aspect of having to anticipate on the adventures that still lie ahead and the necessity of managing your hand accordingly all very much appeal to me. I also like the "push your luck" factor, which underlies almost every little decision you make in this game.

I believe that this game excudes theme.  I love the fact that you are trying to be Beowulf's successor and not fight him or anything, and how it explains the story.  

However, the game does not interact with each other too much.  It does not seem that I can readily "hurt" another player.  I also feel that the amount of luck in the game is too much.  Not just bad luck for you, but better luck for your oppenents.

Not bad overall though, just some problems that could be fixed with some house rules.

The complaints about luck dependence are wildly exaggerated.  The way it was criticized, you'd think this was akin to [gameid=590] or [gameid=45].  It's not.  There's more interesting mechanics and decisions to be made here.  It has echoes of [gameid=475] in the game of chicken that happens with every bidding phase, and I think the risks are an interesting decision point.  I think the theming on this game is quite good, although I have to admit that I'm not particularly familiar with the Beowulf legend.  Succeeds in doing what it tries to do, which is provide an entertaining, luck-filled, exciting time.  I don't understand the flak this game has gotten.  This is a good, light-weight gateway game.

I enjoyed my one and only play (so far), but I'm unsure of how the game would hold up to further plays.

I'll have to give it another spin sometime to properly assess these issues.

I like the way that people press their luck for useful cards, and I also like that it retains the card competition mechanisms from Taj Mahal, but there's something about the game that doesn't seem right.  We had a strange feeling that we were playing the game incorrectly the first time around, since everyone was pushing their luck for cards on every turn, but it turns out that we were doing what we were supposed to be doing.  Very strange.  It has an odd appeal, but it's hard to get the game to the table since others were underwhelmed with it.

I've played this quite a bit now (which is an endorsement, as it's easy to get up and running). I'm unsettled about the "first to break" auctions; there should be some incentive to drop early, some perk (a la Taj Mahal), and more ways to keep others in (spending resources) after the first drop.  Without this, you wind up in too many cases where the decision is clear-cut: risk to stay in (as you're already significantly committed) and who gets luckiest wins. 

On the plus side, there is a lot of enjoyable tension and interesting planning, and it plays very well with the larger end of the range but still works fine with only two. But you have to be OK with your planning to be completely derailed by unlikely runs or it'll disappoint, and I think I'll always be unsettled about that.

Definitely better the second time around.  The first game seemed almost random, whereas the second game we were more able to plan ahead and manage our risks.  We also started playing a variant where you die immediately after taking three wounds.  This seems to emphasize risk management a lot more, since heading into the dragon battle with only one wound can be very dangerous.

The theme did not work with the mechanics. The disconnect was so great it hampered game enjoyment.

RATING: 6.9
Essentially what I consider a card management game wrapped around the theme of a legend.  I find the game fun where the luck of the draw can be mitigated by how you balance your card hand and which episodes you decide to vie for.  Not as good as Knizia's Lord of the Rings, but at least you don't have to play cooperatively.

A fun game with 4 people but not hugely replayable.  Still it plays fairly fast, has beautiful components and is well worth the occassional play.  Not Knizia's best but... not bad.

Nice hand management game. Qwirky shaped board which offers a perfect place to put the draw pile. Art work good. Simple game to play.

RATING: 6
Kind of fun, but just didn't have the right mix for me.  It seems like a family game to play with the kids; but without quite the enjoyment level as Pirate's Cove or some others.  For the adults, there just doesn't seem to be enough there.

Massively underrated game. Just brilliant.

RATING: 7.5
Not an excptional game but i still have to play the complete version with treasures, that seems to be much more interesting.
It seems complicated at first but the game flow is very simple after understanding the various episodes types.
Probably good with a child who is interested in history and adventures.

[EDIT] after my first advanced version i must say this is a very enjoyable game. Of course it is luck dependant but you draw cards and take risks so many times that it seems everything balances up in the end. It's a game of continous bids and auctions with several currencies and this makes it a quite interesting game. It seems complicated at the beginning but after facing a handful of episodes everything is clear.
The only version that is worth playing is the advanced one, when treasures become meaningful on their own instead of just being VPs of another color.

RATING: 10
Ra meets Can't Stop! Like chocolate and peanut butter, two of my favorite games mashed into one. The theme works, but it can set your expectations for something heavier and meatier - heavy calculations can give you a distintive edge, but I think it plays much more fun as a casual, push-your-luck game. It unfolds as a succession of increasingly tense series of bids and risks, until you are either munched by a dragon, or granted the favour of Beowulf. Works very well as a five player game, as everyone can be very involved with little downtime.

RATING: 8
I played this game with 3 players and despite some of the grumbling about it on BGG, I am going to say that I really appreciate the game for what it is. First of all, yes, there is a luck component but I feel that the idea of "taking a risk" in a heroic context fits with the theme of the game. Also, you can't just burn cards willy nilly without looking down the linear path of the saga and plan ahead. The threat of wounds, and the overwhelming desire not to finish last in a bid, make this a compelling game for me. Also, I love the theme! Theme counts for me and is enough to raise this from an 8 for gameplay to a 9 for me overall. I can appreciate a game with awesome mechanics (Caylus), but theme counts too as it adds to my enjoyment of the game... and that is what this is all about, right?

I need to play this again; I really enjoyed the push your luck aspects, and the idea of jockeying for position while journeying with Beowulf. The game seems to be in which encounters you simply bow out and which ones you go all in on, similar in some ways to Taj Mahal.

Rating going up a half point. Certainly nothing earth-shattering here, but uses the Taj Mahal bidding in a more thematic way than taj does. Light family fare, but solid.

RATING: 7
My first 2 games were with 2 and 3 players respectively, with it getting progressively better each play. I'm sure this game will be gaming goodness at 5 though, but for now my rating is an eagerly anticipated 8. With my only concern whether games would become a bit stale after multiple plays as the board doesn't change only the cards you're dealt and when/how you play them. Dropped to 7 already..Update..ok I found a MAJOR rule played incorrectly. Having noticed that if you fail a risk in a major episode you must retire makes a **huge** difference. I appreciate the game much more now and risks are indeed more of a..well.. risk.

I try (sometimes) to be fair and balanced, but the people who praise - or even tolerate - Beowulf's inane card-flipping mechanic are just delusional.  Without it, this game might be worth playing.

Played a few times (with 5 players). A bit dry, and not devoid of luck, but this game seems to get better every time I play it, so I might want to try it again soon.

RATING: 6.5
Very thematic. Push your luck combined with auctions manages to retell the story of Beowulf. The auctions are fixed, so you know what will be available when and which cards can be used to bid on what. This lets you can put a strategy together and take a long term view of things...or you can just toss in cards when you want, and find out later whether you get fame and glory or get bitten in the head by the dragon. :)

RATING: 7
I know some people object to the luck/push your luck aspect of this game, but for me it works really well to evoke the theme of viking bravado that runs through the game. I think that if this game is approached in that fashion rather than as a deep thought strategy game, there is a lot of fun to be had here. I also find this a good game to play with novice/casual gamers, as you can start with just a simple overview and then explain the details of each stage as they come up.

I liked the risk element a lot, but the auctions themselves aren't interesting enough to hold up the rest of the game. 

Maybe my expectations were too high.

RATING: 8
This is a really good game IMO, though for some reason it isn't that popular on BGG. Luck can play a large part, but I don't think it's much more luck-determined than (say) Settlers of Catan, and less frustrating because you can choose not to risk or bid, and keep your powder dry for later on. You need to gamble sometimes, but there's definitely strategy involved.

The game has stylish art by John Howe, who was one of the conceptual artists for the Lord of the Rings movies. The theme doesn't come over strongly in the game mechanics, but the game's progress does follow the story of the poem, requiring you at each episode to expend appropriate categories of card, and giving appropriate rewards.

yeah, it's a Knizia.  yeah i was annoyed at all the risk-taking.  i mean they were taking so many risks, and getting away with it.  that doesn't seem right.  but it was exciting.
on a second play, it was me who was taking and making the risks, and i ended up winning.  small surprise.  we ended up having a debate afterward about the risk-taking, and whether the randomness makes or breaks the game.  i don't think we came to a conclusion.  i will give it one more shot at greatness, before trading.

RATING: 8.5
Fun game with tough choices masquerading as interesting, light decisions. I can see this holding fairly significant replay value for 4-5 players as it plays quickly and the decisions are important, but not taxing or paralyzing. Brisk pace, friendly competition and interesting risk/reward dynamics make this a refreshing game despite many familiar mechanics. Love the press your luck of risking and when to drop out, but a bad run of luck can ruin a single session -- still, in the long run, there's an awful lot to like here.

Excellent game!  I really enjoy the feeling I get while playing, as I keep risking more and more for my Lord Beowulf!  Sometimes it is to my detriment, but all heroes companions have their off days.

RATING: 7
Interesting game of hand management, planning and risk taking. It's a typical Knizia in the sense that there are various resources and there are various ways to score (or lose!) points. Quite derivative of other Knizia games. Beowulf combines tthe cardplay mechanism of Taj Mahal with the event track of Lord of the Rings, but it is less streamlined than TM, more abstract than LotR and has more luck than both. All in all, an enjoyable game, but not Knizia's best.

RATING: 7.5
I liked Beowulf a lot after the first play.  It reminds me a bit of Taj Mahal, a bit of Traumfabrik, and a bit of Lord of the Rings, all mixed together.  I really like the risk mechanic; I know most of you out there don't.  Maybe I need to play it more to see if there's something wrong with it, but I don't see it as of yet.

The game overstays its welcome, and its theme is fairly thin, but the basic mechanics work well and the game has a couple of great push-your-luck elements. There should be more special cards, with more varied effects. The special cards present are few and underwhelming.

RATING: 8
04/16/09 -- Moved rating up to an 8 since this game rocks my ass so much.

11/05/06 - RATING 7: In this game, you play one of 2-5 right-hand men of Beowulf, the legendary slayer of Grendel, a sea hag, and some dragon.  It is pretty awesome, because you lend things like courage, ships and helmets to Beowulf's cause, and in return you receive precious Glory, which undoubtedly scores you greiving, medieval babes in the back room of Beowulf's funeral reception (assumed at game's end).  In any event, this game takes me right into the action;  hopefully you've had the same experience.  If you haven't (which can only be because you haven't played it), and get a chance to, be sure and play with the "advanced" rule(s).  PS:  Take my rating with a grain of salt.  Most of my experience with this game has been 2 player.

I just played a 3 player game recently it it was definitely a better game than a 7 would indicate.  I need to play it more (with > 2).

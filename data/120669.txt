Very simple core rules with a comparative mountain of chrome.

I found the chrome too much; I spent too much time looking up rules, checking events, looking at my cards, and not enough time moving the few units I had on the board around. It felt like the simple core rules and few pieces just weren't enough to support the amount of chrome piled on top.

As the most spare and fluid of the No Retreat games, this is the hardest to like IMO, but it's every bit as great as the other games in the series. The way the deployment, setup, and map-switching works is not super-intuitive but is clever once you get the hang of it. Like No Retreat: The Russian Front, the placement of every counter matters; the game doesn't ask you to make inconsequential decisions. Like The Russian Front, the scenarios are fast and interesting. Unlike The Russian Front, the campaign game is also pretty compelling and you can probably whip through it in a long afternoon. It's not quite in the same league as a The Russian Front just because it's not quite as accessible, but I like it every bit as much.

There is a small bit of eratta regarding AT guns which you need to make sure to grab.

Remarkably and surprisingly different from the first game in the series. The supply rules are well done and really capture the flavor of the see-saw. The mechanism for seizing the initiative, declaring an operation, and continuing is quite nice. Also, the movement from map to map and the redeployments on the same map are a really nice design solution for the episodic nature of the theater. Overall, well done and likely to rise from the initial 7 on further plays. My only issue is I tend to prefer my wargames a bit more abstracted. The rules were quite a bit grittier than is optimal for my taste. Most wargamers won't mind, I'm sure.

RATING: 6
An interesting take on the North Africa Campaign, following on the path of No Retreat. I liked the central "supply as main resource" mechanism, which make the game interesting from an optimisation perspective. I did not like the multi-map approach, as imo especially considering the low density of counters and constant re-deployment, works against the sense of accomplishment and continuity, and the "epic" feeling that one should get playing this campaign. The low counter density, as good as it is for keeping the game playable, results in more of a mechanical exploitation of the system which is quite old-school, rather than sound strategic and doctrinal decisions. The cards are interesting as a randomness factor, but can heavily influence the game, and prior knowledge thereof is advised. The rulebook is not one of the best, which resulted in a steep learning curve which was unnecessary for the low complexity of the system, and the playtime is way too long for what the game stands for. The components and art are first class.

Overall, the game did not capture me, and I would have a hard time getting it to the table after a few months, having to re-climb the learning curve. A good effort, but should have been developed further.

No Retreat! Invasion of Crete

Interesting game, better than looking at what cards you have for resolving the Invasion in the "main game". Although I enjoyed it, it felt a little long for resolving a single event in North Africa.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2017-02-16 : First play and I immediately fell in love with the system. Sure it has some quirks and some rules loopholes, but the idea to split the North African campaign into 5 maps and only play on the "active" one is pure genius and makes you wonder why nobody has done that before. It cuts out the chaff and concentrates the experience, making each and every unit you have a precious commodity, which in turn leads to nail-biting decisions. The cards add a nice wrinkle to it, without being too powerful so as to negate good board-play. The tactical game is prone to combat odds optimization but as there aren't that many units involved it never becomes a problem. Overall : impressed - may be his best game.

RATING: 7
Could have been an excellent game but the horribly edited rule book makes learning and playing the game a chore.

Update: after playing this a few times, I must raise my rating. Behind the strange rules and concepts, it is an unpolished gem that is surpisingly fun to play. Since there are so few counters, itÂ´s a game that is more likely to hit the table when time is limited/brain is tired.

I have mixed feelings regarding this title.  I really don't care for the North African Front part of the game.  It is too much work and uneven for what it is, which is sad given how nice the components are.  When I play this game I feel like I should put it away and play a different title covering the same campaign.  Surprising (disappointed) given how much I like the NR Eastern Front game.  For me it seems like more set-up and tear down then playing.  Just not sure I am a fan of the deployment aspect of the game.

On the other hand the Battle of Crete game is fun and has most of the same rules.  I may come back and edit my rating upward if I feel like giving the main game another chance.  As of 1/20/2018 its a '6' based on '5' for the main game and '7' for the Battle of Crete.

Enjoyed NR Russia but cannot get into North Africa - the rules are just cumbersum and we struggled with a number of the concepts - probably needs to be taught by an experienced player or you need to be prepared to work at it - which is not why we play. Also the cards are very situational and seem to be almost irrelevant unless you happen to have one that fits your circumstances at the particular moment (which seems to happen only rarely!).

All the bits are good quality.

Pradis has done it again: another innovative and fresh take on what is some rather old wine (see Berg's Blood & Sand for another in a long line of unneeded North Africa games). I took off one point for the game being more fiddly than the first in the series, which is funny given the scope. This game gets the Italians right which is nice.

Crete is a relatively fast and fun simulation of an operation that I honestly had no interest in. It is also a good idea to connect its results to the campaign game. Still, I have to wonder why Tunisia was not included as the bonus game? Also, given the supply rules, the Germans will be best served by dropping away from the Allies rather than following their batshit doctrine of dropping right on top of the enemy. What worked at Eben-Emael barely worked on Crete.

Not doing it for me.

I think the premise of NR NAF was a good one.. but they failed in the end. What they wanted was a game that doesn't take 10 or more hours like it's predecessor to finish, one you could stop anytime, without being hassled by a huge map that you'll have to put somewhere safe. And secondly they changed the focus from cards as actions to supply points.
Also they borrowed a lot from another game: Rommel in the desert.
But where RitD succeeds in being this very thight & gritty 2-3 hour conflict where every decision matters, NR NAF is rather a gigantic, inconclusive dice fest with dozens of events that continuously tell you what to do. You roll and roll, troops retreat, sometimes they get destroyed just to be repurchased the next round. While events bring new or take away old troops of yours.
The whole malta mechanic just seems pasted on & almost has a twilight struggle feel to it.

Also this game is anything but elegant. E.g. you can't attack with germans & italians at the same time. You can't stack them together. You can't even stack german infantry with german tanks. How stupid is that?
This seems just like lazy game design.. sure it might make sense game-balance wise.. but then change the stats or something.. don't just make up rules that annoy & feel unthematic.

RATING: 5
Coming in May 2013!  After the highly successful No Retreat: Russian Front, the system is ported to the desert operations in North Africa where Rommel set stage to his name.  Chess-like thinking, card-driven, low counter density make it a playable game for a long time.  

My rating is an initial one based on gameplay of the Invasion of Crete only.  The campaign was somewhat unfamiliar to me. I airdropped majority of the German units behind the back of the Allied defense units, avoiding the anti-air fire which were positioned for coastal defense. The airdrop operation was quite successful without much scatter. The Allied seemed to be "outflanked" on the coast as a result. The maps are divided into several areas of the island of Crete and thus concentrates on the coastal actions. I feel a bit odd when looking at the map divided and they are crossed by the arrows pointing toward each other. Generally, I feel there are not many exciting points to mention in the campaign once the German units are dropped. The Allied can then think of to evacuate or to fight. Each map is too small for large maneuverings.

First impression after playing Operation Compass (which is unplayable) is that I don't like several of the changes since NR: Russian Front, namely: several player turns in one game turn, zipping from map-to-map, and the uselessness of the Italian units. I read another reviewer's comments that this game is very fiddly. Now that I've played it, I feel the same way.

If other scenarios play out like this, then I'll have serious concerns about balance and playability. While playing the first scenario I constantly felt helpless and grossly outmatched. Yeah, I get it that the Italians historically got bushwhacked by the British surprise attack. But that doesn't mean that I want to relive one sided battles, much like I don't want to play a game about Custer's Last Stand.

1/8/14 Update: Played Op. Crusader last night. I had a lot more fun with this scenario. Rating bumped up half a point.

Beautiful game. Top quality components. Unfortunately, I am surprised to still see some graphics erratas after all that find tuning time. Very historical and realistic but WAY more complicated to understand how to play that I expected. Need more details ''payer aid''. Update, after a other campaign game of more then 9 hours ( on 2 days) I find it to complicated for me. To many twists with the cards & the counterblows. I have to go back to the rules book every 15 min. I give up. I wish somebody rework to simplified the set of rules so I could use again those beautiful maps and counters.

RATING: 6
The most praise worthy aspect of the game is the relatively brave decision to include multiple maps and completely redeploy units every month/offensive. This allows easy play of the entire campaign or any scenario one turn at a time as the map and units almost always need to be redeployed between turns. A pad of paper or a photograph of your supply and forcepool is all you need between sessions. 

Ultimately, many of the systems are cumbersome and add little to the game overall. For example -- Malta and the Crete invasion.

I also once lost a game completely from strategic card play... we didn't even have to take the first move to call it. That's a good sign systems aren't working quite as intended.

RATING: 8
Innovative, but classic game of the Desert War with an add on for the Invasion of Crete. The main game has 5 gameboards, in each turn you need to clear the enemy off the board so you can invade to next one along next turn. Running away from a superior enemy until you receive reinforcements and replacements is a valid strategy, but you will have to stop and fight at some point to avoid a sudden death victory. The Germans have fewer units, but better quality and their two anti-tank regiments stops British tank units from using armour superiority. There are five scenarios (Compass, Sunflower, Crusader, Gazala and El Amamein) and trhe Campaign game can be played in short sessions as you reset the units each turn anyway.

Crete shares many concepts, but is a different game played at battalion/company level and has only one scenario. There are three separate maps defended by initially hidden Commonwealth forces with German paratroopers dropping in sticks in hexes downwind of their chosen landing sites. Once they have landed they must sieze ports and airfields so that reinforcements can come in. The Germans have the better units, but are hard pressed until they can muscle up some elbow room.

counterblow seemed a nifty idea at first but now seems to be too much effort (and confusing rules) for the payoff. and I cant shake the feeling that someone can 'game' it to get an unrealistic advantage.

update: some cards too powerful (+4 sps? really?), having 5 uits on the map and having a crt that can make 1 disappear is too much. crt needs to be attritional. finally, multimaps are clever but can be gamed: br sits on msus. axis cant simply go on coast road to bypass them and cut them off as they would do in real life. no, they actually have to blast them out before they can go to next map.

04/12/2013: Purchased

05/01/2014: Tried out Operation Compass as my solitary tutorial game. 

My biggest issue with the game is the rulebook, which is not as organized as I would have preferred. The rules are often not where I would expect them to be, so a lot of time is spent riffling through each page of the rulebook to find the rule that I am looking for. 

There are also a lot of gaps in the ruleset -- for example, the rules do not state clearly the number of Movement Points required to enter a hex that has multiple terrain types, there is no mention of what Game Turn event constitutes an "Allied Turn Event" and so on. 

I understand from the forums that there are many typographical errors and mistakes in the playbook illustrations, which does little to encourage a newcomer to the game like me to embrace it or the larger series. 

Frankly, I was very much looking forward to the No Retreat series before I got this copy, but my first impressions and experiences with this game have put a abrupt halt to that. I have now cancelled my pre-orders of the other games in the No Retreat series, as I fear that the mechanics would be similar. 

I might be willing to try this game again, but I highly doubt that my follow-up experience would be any different.

RATING: 9
Brilliant game design.  Poorly written rules book drops it down a point.  Still, maybe the best overall WWII North Africa game ever.

The multiple maps are nothing to worry about and work to eliminate all the downtime and time wasting turns you would have otherwise, when the armies need to rest and resupply.   It is a strength of the game not a weakness.

The footprint is relatively small at any one time as you only use one map.  The counter density is low.  Both the small footprint and low counter density are important to me.  The longer playing time is not as good and I prefer games that play in an hour or two at the absolute most.  This goes about 2-3 per scenario, maybe 4 but that time may be cut down once I really get the rules memorized.  That darn rulebook again!

Just setup the Crete scenario. Can't wait.

Update: Found it confusing to use the rulebook for the Crete game so I started a campaign in the North African desert instead. Took a few nights to understand how the game works, memorize the sequence of play and what is resolved where and when. I must say I'm really starting to like this game. I haven't played the Russian front game yet and no other game in the North African theatre so it would be difficult to compare, but I'm really looking forward to play some more of this. I Like the changing of maps, the counterblows, the component quality, the see saw. Yeah, initial rating but so far it looks really good.

Got my head around the Crete game eventually and it is simpler to play and doesn't take too long. This is a really nice package from GMT and my initial rating stands firm.

The rules seem complex and nuanced, maybe even "fiddly", but that's because it's all accomplished with just a handful of unit counters.   When I ran through the "Compass" scenario (the recommended first tutorial), by the second game turn the British had pushed the Italians into oblivion.  Only two British unit counters remained on the map.  The third game turn saw two previously eliminated Italian units return as a force build, but they were chased all the way to Benghazi.   There were only four counters on the final map.   Yes, this is "No Retreat", just like the Eastern Front version.   Very low counter density.  However, I like the movement from map to map because you can walk away from the game and take a break between maps.   The game is easily digestible in smaller chunks.  I'm enjoying it.

Rating lowered at this time as this game certainly is a disappointment, and I am experiencing rules fatigue with the design. 

The GMT version is better than the VPG version (especially the components, obviously) but while it solves old problems from the prior release, it creates just as many new problems. How frustrating.

I sympathize with the designer who was completely abandoned by the developer (Alan Emrich), but still I will not be purchasing any more games in the series unless it is determined that they are properly developed.

I would never turn down a game of this. I do have some issues with the rules, which are quite ambiguous. It takes some work to comprhend how the system works, including switching boards. There is a lot to keep track of and much rule checking. This is not an introductory game as some people have described no Retreat: The Russian Front. 

I liked it, so do not get me wrong. A friend of mine complained that it was like a see saw. The British are strong, then the Germans, and then the British again. I thought that this made it historical. I must note here that I beat him as the Germans and the British and this maybe why he was critical, but he did have a point. There is a big ebb and flow based on supply points.

RATING: 8
The low counter density and highly mobile forces really fit the situation well.  The multiple maps convey the back and forth of the campaign in a very intuitive way.  Card play adds a nice amount of uncertainty to the otherwise completely visible forces without dominating play as in a CDG.  I like it better than NR: Russian Front.

Played this and was surprised that it was not my cup of tea.  I like the idea of supply as "money" to buy things but too many abstract things (jumping between maps) and lots of moving parts that don't seem to add a lot to the game other than confusion.

GAME: Jarl: The Vikings Tile-Laying Game
RANK: 3132
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
too many individual units
I can't imagine how someone could keep all the different movement in mind
so it is just a chaotic trial and error without much tactics

I really tried to like the game
nice material, but that doesn't help

RATING: 6
Very similar to The Duke, but with a lot more symbols and icons on the tiles, and erratic movement patterns.  The production quality is excellent, the pieces feel hefty and smooth, like playing with Hive tiles.  The biggest thing going against Jarl is that the Duke pieces move in more straightforward ways, making it more accessible.

Plays almost exactly like its predecessor The Duke, but when I opened the box I was wowed by the gorgeous tiles, love clinging those around in the bag or together. So aesthetically I might like this a wee bit more, there are also some small differences in how the Viking armies use their strategies (more defensive, no sliding). Just a wonderful package here for those seeking a thematic spin on Chess with a lot of depth.

With all the expansions, The Duke nudges ahead, but who knows what lies down the road for this, and you can actually play a Viking army AGAINST a Duke one, so you could even view this as another expansion. So it's pretty awesome.

Similar with the Duke. However, tiles are so powerful which makes the game not as intersting as the Duke. Jarl can jump and it's hard to be captured.

The black tiles are made of a mottled material that's supposed to look like granite, but the white speckles obscure vital bits of the iconography! On black tiles the "Command" symbol is impossible to see from a distance.

RATING: 6
I have to give this a lower rating than the Duke because of its massive playtime compared to the Duke.  Also because of the quality of the pieces.  While I like that they are bakelite, it's REALLY hard to see the command icons at a glance.  On top of that, I'm always confused on which sides pieces start on since the colors are opposite for the black and white player.

Unfortunately, I think this one might be a miss for Catalyst.  Duke > Jarl.

I'm just not a fan. It takes The Duke and adds unnecessary complexity that just feels fussy. My oldest son, however, likes it better than The Duke because of the added complexity, so I've added a point to account for that. Some tiles are hard to read the iconography. B&N red dot sale

Sold this without even playing it.  The blocking and guarding rules were too wonky to even interest me, and the little corner marks to identify certain moves were too tiny.  If I want a game of this style, I'll buy the original Duke, or just play the more streamlined Onitama, which I enjoy.

Beautiful components.  Brain teaser with how the unit tiles flip over after moving and thus their next move will be different.  Experience with the tiles helps to predict this better as you go.

Nice and light in terms of play time, but pretty deep strategically.

Jarl: the Vikings Tile-Laying Game lacks the same clean, crisp tactical play as its counterpart, The Duke.

The game tiles, while they feel physically good in hand, are poorly designed. The decision to have a black pieces with white spots then have white lines is just bad. Also, good luck determining command spots as they blend right into the tiles.

Gameplay wise, things are not much better. Blocking is INCREDIBLY fiddly. This element was brought into the Authurian expansion in the Duke which was met with some confusion. In Jarl, blocking is everywhere.

Another issue is that the Jarl itself is hard to pin down which makes for longer games and can be a bit frustrating.

If the tiles themselves were designed better, the game would be more playable. Though with these issues, I'll be sticking to the Duke.

Only played it a few times, but it felt like a more chaotic version of the Duke, with less intuitive tiles. I remember it being extremely difficult to try and understand what would happen if I made a given move.

Production values are also mildly annoying. The tokens are very pleasant to hold, but the coloration on the white tokens made it very difficult to distinguish random speckles of color from the command icons.

Theme: Vikings TV show - abstract anyway
Gameplay: Abstract game where the movements are determined by the symbols on the piece itself which flip when activated revealing new symbols/movements available now. Basically re-skinned THE DUKE but with more defensive-style abilities.
Components: Amazingly tactile Bakelite, but can be hard to read.
Replayability: 2 player limit on hitting the table, not as accessible as THE DUKE but prettier.
Rulebook: Could've been a hell of a lot more clear in some ways.

A very good chess-like game. I like the components, not as much as The Duke's, but they're still very good quality and the game has some interesting mechanics to add to The Duke's main ones.

RATING: 8.5
A lot like The Duke in gameplay, but the pieces are made of sturdy bakelite and have different names and movement.  The game is compatible with The Duke, so you can actually run a Jarl vs. The Duke game, if you wish.

The variation on the Duke is nice. The tiles have a nice feel, but I hate the speckled black tiles. It's harder to see the symbols especially when some of those are already small white dots. Wish the tiles were flat black. I think I would like it more on that alone.

Én sem hittem volna, hogy ezt írom, de nagyon más érzetű, mint a Duke. Bár egyikben sincsenek nagy tapasztalataim, a Jarlt építkezősebbnek érzem, a sok védekező képesség miatt több dologra kell figyelni, kicsit nehezebb átlátni mindent, a játékidő is elhúzódik némileg. Ugyanakkor szerintem megéri. Hasonló szabályrendszer, mégis más játékélmény. Itt nagyon mozgékonyak a csapatok, és maga Jarl is, ami nehézzé teszi a "mattadást", de egyben izgalmassá is. Azt hiszem, én elfogult vagyok, és még az sem zavar, hogy ezt a hatásvadász Viking plecsnit rányomták a dobozra, sőt a műanyag lapkák is meglepően tetszenek, pedig hát a fa mégiscsak fa...:)

I like the quality of the pieces and the Nordic flavor but the highly mobile Jarl pieces and the many defense icons make this a far slower, more defensive game than the Duke. I prefer the more dynamic original.

See my comments for The Duke. Jarl is much more infuriating than The Duke (as you tend to find that everything you want to do has already been thwarted by your opponent). Jarl frequently pisses you off while you're playing it; then you can't wait to play it again.

Adapted gameplay from The Duke (2013), re-themed into the Vikings TV show (History Channel, 2013-).

Heard gameplay is more defensive manoeuvring than direct attack like The Duke. However both are compatible to be played against each other (offers different game experiences).

I need to bring this out more. I'm stuck on onitama currently, but I do love some games. I had no problem understanding the iconography which seems to be the main complaint as well as the black tiles, compared to the duke. I do not own the duke, and don't plan on buying it. I wish I knew other people around here with games so I can try some out instead of researching and buying.

While it follows the same system setup with The Duke, the two games feel distinctly different in style. The Duke has much more movement and capturing. Jarl slows the action down and creates a more defensive game. 

I certainly enjoy both games.

I liked "The Duke" and Jarl has the same rules just different pieces.  But the pieces make all the difference.  The Jarl pieces are generally slow, have lots of defensive abilities, and the Jarl itself is very fast.  So, the game tends to drag if not completely stall.  It can end if someone is sloppy, but even thinking one turn ahead seems to be enough to stalemate any opponent, so there isn't much potential for depth.  For a lighter game played quickly, I'd also prefer the faster more agile units from The Duke, so Jarl just doesn't fit any niche.

Also, the rules are just as terribly written, only this time the poorly written abilities are on units in the core set (not just mini expansions), so you can't escape the ambiguities and gaps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The playtime for this game is far longer than the Duke, and the Jarl is exceptionally hard to pin down for the win. Additionally, the iconography on the tiles is far inferior to the Duke. It's particularly hard to see the command icons on this one.

Despite all this, it's still basically the Duke, so it's not too bad overall.

We play sometimes in the manner of bughouse chess – with all the pieces and two 8x8 boards. This variant is shogi-like and extremely fun.

RATING: 8
The Duke with a defensive mindset. I find it more tensed and less prone to end on a dramatic move/draw. It feels deeply strategic building a defensive position and trying to crack open the opponent's defense. I like it slightly more than The Duke, but is has some issues: tiles are hard to read, there are too many symbols to learn the tiles easily, some tiles give the feeling that their patterns are random and it may be a little longish with some players. 
Overall a solid game. Recommended.

Love The Duke and love clickety clackety bakelite, but I decided against getting this one because the pieces just don't look functional. The black tiles are extremely difficult to read, and the command icons are waaay too subtle, especially on the black. Combine that with a cheesy and unreadable faux-runic font (a design pet peeve of mine), and I decided to pass.

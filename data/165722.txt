Like Air Hockey but you can't win by just bashing over and and over.  Requires finesse!  Universally well-received.

Only one thing could be improved--the strikers/magnets need pads to reduce the scraping and noise.

Fun dexterity game, rather like a cross between air hockey and bar billiards.  It's fun, but fiddly for those who have big hands.  I'd say that Couronne was better in terms of a wooden game where you try to get something in a hole.

A dexterity game that looked not good to me. Having played it, I quite enjoyed it. The different ways to score create an interesting push and pull for each point during the game. I love that it isn't just about putting the ball in the goal... you also have to avoid getting attached to two of the magnetic disks and avoid dropping your pawn in your own goal. Clever and plays well!

----------------------------
I have always been a fan of Air hockey, and this is by far the best thing I think to come close to being as fun in your own home.  This might actually be better, since there is more skill involved in this game than just regular air hockey.  I think this is a no brainer pick up if you like dexterity games

This has been the surprise of Gen Con for me. An absolute blast to play, this dexterity game is like air hockey but with a few welcome extra twists, and shrunk down. I only played two games, and it will be interesting to see if it holds up with longer plays. I'll find out since I'll buy it.

The magnetic air hockey idea is kind of cool, but the components are only adequate and don't hold up past a certain, rather sedate, level of play.

My first thought was to say "It's a kids game," but on second thought, I doubt that many kids have the restraint or fine motor control needed to succeed.  More likely they'll get frustrated and give up, if they don't break something first.

A nice little table game, based loosely on air hockey, where players are trying to flick a ball into an opponent's goal.  The player's "bat" is controlled from under the table using a strong magnet to move the bat around on the playing surface.  It's a neat idea and makes for some fast paced action.  Nice quality for the price.

Fun to play and simple to teach, The rules are familiar (soccer, ice hockey) but the magnets do add a layer of surprise and tactics. 
There are a few cons as well. First, I don't like that the players can fall in their own goals. Also, I felt I couldn't move the pieces as quick as I wanted or they would separate. The ball is so light, it easily jumps out when you're trying to get it out of a corner.

We were looking for a tabletop air hockey game for the kids this christmas.  However, the ones we found took 8 batteries.  We weren't into that whole "battery" thing, and who knows how long they'll last?  KLASK has turned out to be a great alternative that still gives them that "feel" they would have gotten from tabletop air hockey.  No batteries, just powerful magnets.  It's a fun little game and lasts only 5-10 minutes maybe, so who wouldn't be up for a game of KLASK now and again?

Amazing, more forgiving than Crokinole, which I also love.

It hasn't gone back in the box since I bought it weeks ago.

When you first see Klask, you start wondering, does it actually works? Yes, it look damn small board and a bit "toyish". But after you've tried it - you'll love it! It really is amazingly fun and addictive dexterity game which you want to play more and more. It's a way better than much more expensive WeyKick and those little magnets bring more tactical elements to the game. So yes, if you like dexterity games, then you should try Klask too. For me this is second best (if not the best - that we'll see in the future) dexterity game there is... right after a damn expensive Crokinole which I also own).

Wow what a fun and unique invention. Definitely plays like a tabletop version of air hockey. This is fun for everyone, and rather than relying on hitting it as hard as you can and risking taking a flying puck to the chest, Klask relies more on skill and finesse. Crokinole is more relaxing and care free, Klask is more fast paced and enthousiastic..I still prefer Crokinole, but considering Klask can be had for $45 rather than $200, and is really exciting, it's definitely the value choice. Also, try waxing your board, it'll help reduce the chalk on chalkboard sound it makes.

Ich bin von der Qualität der Materialien etwas enttäuscht. Die Bewegung über das Spielfeld fühlt sich wesentlich rau an. Die Spielfiguren rutschen dadurch etwas schwerfällig. Weiterhin hätte ich mir gewünscht das der Ball etwas schwerer wäre, da dieser oft aus dem Spielfeld hüpft. Im Spielinhalt sind deshalb ein Ersatzball und ein Ersatzmagnet enthalten.

Schönes Geschicklichkeitsspiel, aber nichts sonderlich neues. 

Alles in allem für den Preis noch in Ordnung.

Fantastic for what it is.  People compare it to foosball, but it's not nearly as reliant on skill IMO.  I have years and years of foosball experience...it's not just about spinning sticks.  Having said that, there is still some thinkiness to this one, and it's quite fun to pull out with new people.  The little bumpers make all of the difference.

Maybe it's wrong to say that this silly little dexterity game that can't even really be called a board game is one of the funnest gaming experiences I have... but it feels so right.

One little con is that the playing surface gets scratched up pretty quick.  But it doesn't affect the gameplay.  Just the visual.  And I don't know how it could be avoided.

Cool dexterity game with that "just one more" addictive quality. We decided to make it worth two points if you score with two white magnets. I recommend playing three or five sets with tennis scoring. Probably in my top three dexterity games with Crokinole and Tumblin' Dice.

RATING: 9
It's perfect if you're looking for a fun and quick parlor/dexterity game.

Combines the fun of air hockey and foosball in a $50 package that's made of solid components and easily transportable.

My only two gripes are: 
1. I wish there were more extra components included in the game - one bumper and one ball seems a bit optimistic, but hopefully replacements will be available soon 
2. The board can be moved a bit too easily, especially when the action gets heated. A quick remedy for this is to use a card game playmat (such as those used for MtG) or an oversized mousepad.

Oh Man! So good I went out and bought a copy after I played it. (Target sale it cost me $34 bucks!) Awesome table top "air hockey" wannabe. It has a rolling ball and magnets.

I know it will be a huge hit with everyone! :D Dexterity game- so again, if you don't like that then  you might not enjoy this, but it is hard not to!

Mini air hockey but with white magnetic obstacles, adding spice to the game.

I named the white magnetic pieces "lice". It adds interesting sound bites to the game, such as, "Don't get infected! If you get infected twice, you are out!" hahaha.

.:Best 2:.

My Notes
For beginners, I don't count it as a point if their pawn accidentally falls into the hole. They may move the pawn out.

So similar to a number of parlor games I played as a kid this is one of those fun, wooden dexterity games with some cool twists that give everyone a chance. Unlike foosball and air hockey, there are some strategic equalizers that enable anyone a chance to win.

A fast furious unique dexterity game.  It seems like a gimmick with the magnetic pieces but they are strong magnets so there is good control.

RATING: 6
This is more than just-another-air-hockey-variant.  The white magnets create a dynamic board with shifting obstacles, so there is more than just the ball itself to think about.  Also, the magnetic control isn't just a gimmick, since going too fast can lose control of your bumper or knock it over, so there is some additional skill in regulating your speed.  The end result is neat, although not mind blowing.

open question:  does it hold interest over time and get more interesting after more plays?

RATING: 7
This is an air hockey-like dexterity game where each player controls a tall, thin pawn with a magnet under the play surface and uses it to hit a small plastic ball into their opponent's goal.  You also score your opponent a point if you fall into your own goal or attrack 2 of the 3 magnets in the center of the play area.

This is a quick and simple game that works great with everyone.  If you like air hockey or games of the like there is a lot to like here.  The only issues I have with it at all are with the components which could be a bit better.

The play surface is a bit rough and causes a lot of noise when playing and also makes movement really not smooth.  This isn't a huge deal and I think I can correct it some with some wood polish.  The more egregious issue though is my copy came with uneven feet so it wobbles a lot which causes issues when playing.  I fixed it with a furniture pad but that also introduces a leveling issue.  Perhaps I can take the time to trim two pads and attack them to opposite legs to both stop it from wobbling and using a level to keep it as level as possible in the end but that is a lot more work than should be necessary.

I think this was alright for about five minutes, but it really loses it's luster pretty quick.   Yeah, it's well made and all, kind of a cheaper version of Weykick but it still takes up a good bit of room, and I don't think the game is as compelling as that one, I think you're better to save up and shell out for the bigger version of the same if this is your bag.   I'm not, the only dexterity game I need is Crokinole I think for life.

RATING: 8
A lot more fun than I expected. What makes the game interesting is the multiple ways to score points. Instead of just batting the ball back and forth, you're trying to keep up with a few different things at once all while defending your goal. If you fall into your own goal (which is really easy to do) then your opponent scores. If you get two of the three neutral magnets stuck to you, your opponent scores. If you lose control of your magnetic piece (usually because you moved it too fast and it went flying across the board), your opponent gets a point. And of course if you land the ball into your opponent's goal then you get a point.

Just hitting the ball back and forth would get old pretty quickly, but the different elements going on at once make this a lot of fun.

RATING: 6.5
That seems like a low rating to me, but I am trying to be more critical with my ratings and I am tired of giving out 7's.

If you are on a tight gaming budget or have limited shelf space then KLASK is probably not worth the money. But if you can stretch you will have an awesome two-player game that almost everyone will want to at least try once and probably a lot more. 

The components really are sturdy and everything works exactly as it should. Nothing funky or irritating that makes you think "This would be a fun game if ________ worked better."

Everyone loves KLASK, but in the end it is a parlor game that doesn't require great skill (I am not sure you could get really skillful) nor does it make you think about it on the car ride home or in the shower the next morning.





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

KLASK was an unexpected hit at GenCon 2016. I'm a huge air hockey fan, and this scratches much of the same itch in a micro format. 

Balancing your offensive against both defending your goal, losing your defender in our own goal (KLASKing yourself) and avoiding the on-board magnets leads to a real hectic time.

The rounds play lightning fast to boot. This would have been a fantastic game to place on our home bar back in our college days

A wonderful dexterity game. It's not just air hockey with magnets, the "little white buggers," the household name for the 3 white magnets in the center, make the game far more interesting.

I can see Klask being a dexterity favorite for a long, long time.

The overall concept of this game is great, but unfortunately there's too much friction in the movement of magnetic strikers.

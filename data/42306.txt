Fiddly and expensive, but beautiful. Definitely prefer the miniatures over a completely card-based implementation also for usability reasons in addition to the obvious aesthetic improvement. Quality of cardboard components was surprisingly a bit worse than the "normal" version that I have.

This game is so close to an 8 for me.  The flying around and getting in range is amazing.  I don't think that there needed to be special kinds of planes, random damage, and special damage.  The more mechanics the designer added, the less he distilled the thrill of being a fighter ace.

Really enjoy playing this game. Very easy to teach, and just enough strategy for those looking for something more than risk.Coolest attacking mechanism i have ever used in a game, plus everyone takes there turn at the same time really frees up that lag time in between. 10 out of 10 for innovation.

Fun light dogfighting game set in WW2.  Differs from the WW1 version in that only one card is set up in advance and you have the option of selecting low or high speed on the cards.  Maneuverability is not as distinct between the airplanes as it is in the WW1 version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The boardgame without a board. All you need for this game is a group of people who enjoy WW2 and aerial combat and a really, really, REALLY large table.

The game is pretty straight forward: win the dogfight and send your opponent down in flames. Pilot your plane carefully and use your maneuvering cards to get behind your opponent and shoot him down with a lucky shot.

The set comes with 4 very nice miniatures and their maneuvering cards, lots of damage counters and a set of rulers so you determine if the opponent is in fire range.

A game for passionate players in which you can have lots of fun. Aces High!

A fun little game that new people can learn with ease.
When some of the advanced rules are thrown into the mix it makes the game more exciting.
I would not go as far as to say that there aren't better airplane games out there but this one dos what it needs to do very well and doesn't over complicated things.

A thrilling game were the turns play out very quickly, but it sometimes stutters whilst players jockey for position in what feels like a very good Dogfighting game.  It can also suffer if you are playing against people who arn't averse to taking a small advantage here and there.

Very thematic gameplay, but I think we played it on a too large "board", so the game was a little too slow.

RATING: 8
Great strategy, planning, war-based game.  The game uses beautiful miniatures that even have bases and stands!  For the war-based and miniature-based fans, this is a great game.  For those not as interested in long, drawn-out games of war that involve strategy and miniatures, this is not a game for you.  The game works best with 2-4 players, in my opinion. Do not use too many planes per player, or the game drags on and the fun is exhausted.  Also, it becomes too confusing.  I would suggest up to 4 planes for each player in a 2 player match.  I would suggest no more than 3 planes per player in a 3 or 4 player match.  I find 'house rules' to be fun as well - for example, start with 3 planes and have 1 plane in reserve to be called into play upon losing a plane.  This allows for a longer game and without the confusion of having too many planes on the playing mat.  The game can take up to 'hours' to complete.

Love the minis (and I love airplanes), and the game itself is fun.  

Im convinced theres a much better way to execute the mechanics; as implemented its WAY too fiddly.  Theres no reason you need a play card/dashboard for your three maneuver cards, they should just be in a tray only visible to you ala Memoir 44.  The pace of the game means you are constantly messing with cards and speed chits.  Theres a bajillion damage chits, no organization for them in the box, and frankly, Im not sure why it needs to be that complex.  The airplane mounts are hard to handle and the planes many times come off the base during handling.

So the game itself, very cool.  The implementation?  not so much.

I had some fond memories of this game, unfortunately it does not work it is strange depiction of 3d fights in 2d system. So game felt completely unrealistic and unengaging.

With so many great air wargames especially those created by LBW (like Burning Blue, Wing Leader, Bomber Command) I would much rather spend time on these than on Wings of War.

I'm a huge fan of WWII era aircraft, and this game is a fantastic blend of gameplay and WWII aircraft simulation. The maneuvers and aircraft stats seem to reflect a somewhat abstract, but not unrealistic representation of the various aircraft. Yet the game plays easily, with very little to bog it down. The basic game is easy to get into, and there are plenty of optional rules to make the game play a little more realistic and enjoyable for those that like more depth. Great potential for adding house rules as well. I love this game.

The deluxe set in particular is a great place to start. It includes all the updated rules for the basic game, plus the rules from 'fire from the skies' expansion. 

The four included miniatures are fantastic! While all four of the deluxe miniatures are still unique repaints, three of them have identical stats to plane miniatures available elsewhere. One of the deluxe miniatures, the US Marine FM-1 Wildcat, is slightly different than the other Wildcats in the game. Historically, the Marine FM-1 was identical to the F4F-4, but with fewer guns. The game seems to accurately reflect this difference in the aircraft stats.

The only thing I would have liked to have seen would be more numeric chits for representing altitude and fuel. There's only a few in the deluxe set. It's not a big deal because you can always record these things on paper.

I bought the WWII deluxe set as an addition to the basic + expansion sets that I already owned. It's a great addition, but a 'must buy' if you are just looking at getting into the game. It's a great place to start.

It is childish, granted; yet, it is going be a boomer after an appropriate rule-set, which is missing for the time being. For all that, the game system is open-ended and flexible enough to hope for a forthcoming enhancement

All the damage chits, range sticks, and four planes. In terms of dollar value, this is the way to get into the system. Prefer WWI overall, but WWII has a little more crunch in the rules.

La primera partida me dejo algo frió, jugamos 2 vs. 2 (aviones) con las reglas básicas y me pareció un poco soso, en la segunda partida en cambio fue 3 vs 3 (aviones) y estuvo muy reñido ganando por la mínima, al caza superviviente solo le quedaban un par de puntos de daño, me pareció una partida mucho mas tensa que la anterior y me gusto bastante mas. Seguiremos probando...
Me atrae a priori mas que el X-wing por la posibilidad histórica del juego.

Wonderful game with beautiful pre-painted minis and great game play. Only issue of this set is that the Zero is not nearly maneuverable enough.  After market maneuver cards correct this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat concept - I can see why people would enjoy it so much.  For me, though, far too much downtime of constantly resorting and selecting maneuver cards and speed tokens.  Becomes really unwieldy if players are controlling more than a single ship.  But you want a good amount of ships on the table (3-4 per side), I'd think, to create some more interaction and to slightly reduce the potential lucky damage token draw(s) that essentially take a plane out of the fight right away.

[color=#CC0000]

Very pretty, but not well executed.  My pegs simply do not stick together and don't even come close to sticking to the bases.  I have put a bit of maple syrup in each hole and hope that this stickies them up a little for my next play.

[b]LOSE THE BEVELED EDGE ON THE BASES PLEASE[/b].  Have any of you designers actually played this?  If anything the edge of the bases should bevel backwards to be easier to grasp with a finger tip.  The beveled base even makes it difficult to slip a card under the base to assist picking it up.  As best I can tell the bases have been designed to be hard to pick up, a problem exacerbated by the peg problem I mention above.  When planes are close to or on top of each other it is a complete hassle to execute movement.  Stupid Stupid design decision.  

All that said the models are beautiful.  It's hard to play without them because of it.  Unfortunately it's hard to play [u]with[/u] them as well, so I have a love-hate relationship with this package.  I'd pay for better bases and better pegs.  I'd also pay for damage cards instead of chits, but I'll save that gripe for another day.

Best game components EVER!!  Those are wonderfully detailed aircraft minis!  And fortunately, they have a fantastic game to go with them.  I've only played the basic rules, but they were very easy to learn and the game flows along wonderfully, even with 4 players, with next to no down time.  I don't think it would be possible to get a better dogfighting simulation with such a simple set of rules, and each plane's maneuverability and speed is simulated with a straight-forward deck of cards.  Brilliant!!  I also find the team aspect in a 4-player game with each player controlling a single aircraft to be quite enjoyable, as well as the uncertainty associated with the plane damage.  It would certainly be fun to try some of the advanced rules, such as altitude rules and the various missions.  So what would the criticisms be?  It's hard to think of any, except I wish there was more airplane goodness (such as bombers who have to go after targets while being protected by the fighters, and who have gunners that shoot multiple directions).  And for people who have difficulty visualizing spacial awareness in their head, this game could be quite frustrating.  For example, my wife, who is a very intelligent woman, just doesn't compute in this manner - she gets extremely frustrated with "RoboRally", and she had difficulties with this game.  But other than that - this is a truly fantastic game!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Overall, I think the WWI game is much tighter with more action. This version has more options to play slow vs. fast movement actions but leads to a more spread out dogfight with fewer shots taken.  Still, it's a fun, fast tactical WWII air combat game worth the buy if you like WWII over WWI and you want fast play with a minimalist rules set.

I bought a supplemental Spitfire MKII and another Messerschmitt to expand the team games. Might also buy a couple of zeros.

I strongly recommend the official playmat. East or West, it doesn't really matter. I also strongly recommend NOT using any of the variant rules, which add complexity and unwanted game-length and not nearly as much fun as I had dreamed.

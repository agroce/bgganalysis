One Deck Dungeon is frustration in a small box. No matter what choice you try to make, you will either run out of time, run out of options, or run out of dice to cover the impossibly difficult monsters you'll come across. It is extraordinarily unbalanced, with players winning quite infrequently. Look at the reviews, and you'll see a definite pattern, even among those who enjoy it: it is insanely, brutally difficult, with very little chance of success. For some that's a great time. I prefer something where the cards are not literally stacked against me.

It's a challenging little game (I've only played it solo). I do find it difficult to keep all the mechanics in my head completely straight. It's easy to make a rules mistake in this game and make your whole results null and void.

Two plays so far. First play was with 2 players and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is definitely a lot of luck, but there are a lot of luck mitigation opportunities through items & skills. Second time I played it as a solo game and also loved it. It comes with a campaign in the box, which might be a lot of fun (and probably the only way to take down some of the hardest dungeons in the box).  I love how much 'game' there is in this tiny box. It's easy to grab and play with someone at bars  or coffee shops and the easy set-up and well-designed solo rules make it a real solo game of choice. The different heroes & dungeons add replayability, which will only be increased with upcoming expansions. Not a whole lot to complain about with this one, as long as you accept that luck is a big part of this game. Also love the female characters -
 unexpected!

RATING: 5
This is a good single player dungeon crawler that is relatively quick and easy to learn. The Artwork looks great and is well polished. The time mechanic and player progression sheets are unique mechanics. I would not recommend this for co-op play as the game generates little discussion and player interaction.

It is a full dungeon dweller in all its glory!  The game may look easy at first but you will get roughed up.  As you play the game, some really good strategy starts to unfold with this one.  Highly recommend starting the campaign mode right away to acquire those extra skills.  You will need them for the harder scenarios.  Asmadi Games support is top notch as well!  Can't wait for the expansion!  Enjoy!

Okay, here's the deal.  The mechanic of rolling dice then using your skills to manipulate the outcome is cool.  It's satisfying to finagle the numbers to be exactly what you need.  Also, the fact that every challenge is your choice of exp, stats, or a new skill is a really cool mechanical trick that feels good and uses the nature of the board game medium to its fullest.

But the game is boring as hell.

There's no interaction with other players, no sense of risk or urgency or any real reason to keep playing.  Even on two player co-op, it doesn't really feel like you're playing together.  You're just sort of fiddling with your own board state, and sometimes bad stuff happens, and maybe there's another player doing it too at the same table and I guess that's LIKE playing a game with your friends?  But not really playing the game WITH your friends.

I actually backed this game on Kickstarter, because it looked like a cool idea, and I'm glad that it went well for them.  I just wish that it had a little more substance to it.

This game feels like a rogue-like dungeon crawler, which is exactly what I was hoping for when I bought it.

After a few playthroughs, I can already tell I'll want an expansion with more monsters to fight.

The "campaign mode" is interesting. I've not seen a tabletop game outside of traditional RPGs that have progression and talent systems built into them. Playing the easier mode to unlock abilities to play the harder modes is a really cool idea.

Played this solo. Its complex enough to keep you at it - and brutal enough that it is hard to win. Rules are a bit scant - but after a few goes I think I am getting the hang of them. Tactics seem to be key - do you get more skills - and hence more dice or else get experience and move up a level... Or will you go for this and get killed before you acquire the experience you need!

I have two plays in and am just 'meh.' I will say that this game has helped me realize that I do not like so much randomness in the games I play and that I'm a Euro-gamer.

This is a good game, but not for me. I can see that there is the possibility to engine build with the skills but the randomness just shoots me in my behind.

What was I expecting with a dice game? I'm not sure. I do really enjoy the theme and the game play. The art is done really well also. All are done really well. It's just not for me. I wanted to rate it lower but I try and rate games on its mechanics and game play and try and not let my emotions rate games for me.

Initial Impression: I'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought this game but I'm happy to say that it delivers an experience that I didn't realize I was missing from my collection. This game is a puzzle in a box, with the pieces being the dice and the challenge being how to manipulate them to the best effect. The artwork is endearing and cute. The transparent dice are of high quality. For this game, the generic theme neither enhances nor detracts from the overall gameplay. I enjoy this game for what it is, a nice portable filler with a small footprint. Something about it gives me that "just one more game" urge to break it out and play it repeatedly.

FAVORITE FILLER SOLO GAME

1-2 Players (Best: 1) / 30-45 Min / Weight: 2.00
Type: Thematic / Co-op / Solo

+ Simple rule.
+ Highly portable. Also small footprint. Perfect game for travel.
+ Captures rogue-like game feeling very well.
+ Quite a lot of replayability in a small box: several choices for characters and dungeons
+ Has campaign mode

- Monster / peril deck feels a bit repetitive after a few plays. Anticipate expansions.

I hope there is a hunger mechanic. I wish it is added in an expansion.

e Dungeon crawler with cards.

The best thing here is that once you defeat a dungeon card you can decide how the card is used : as an extra item, as a skill, to level up through XP etc ...

Multi use of cards is always great but here it is rather underwhelming as luck is much too high.

Of course this game is not a Descent 2 competitor. Portability is its main feature.

After playing it 6 times I downgraded it again to around 5. A little let down as I think balance is a bit off. It is one of these much hyped small Kickstarter projects with lots of promisses but no meat to the bones.

Quick and too easy money grab for its designer(s).

Have already tried out with Tabletop Simulator. I guess it should be a must to own one. There are still some rooms of improvement but it is still good. You can play it alone without feeling bored, as it is roguelike every time you play. With the character list like we did in DnD, you can strengthen your hero. In long term, you are likely to beat the hardest dungeon by yourself.

Great solo game, the rule book is poorly done though.  All the rules are there, but not methodically.  ie; There's this thing you need to know, but let's show you this first, then not refer back to the actual thing.  The game supports 2-Players but not clearly detailed on how to play.  Again; good game, murky rulebook.

Ok, I am a sucker for solitaire games. I also tend to enjoy dungeon based games. So, One Deck Dungeon (or ODD as it will now be known) should be right up my alley. Well, it is! I played this 6 times in a row on Saturday, finishing 4-2. This game is so simple but does pack enough good decisions into a 30 minute game to really make it worthwhile. You pick a character, which are your normal standard fantasy tropes (Warrior, Mage, etc.) and then pick a dungeon. There is 1 easy, 2 medium and 2 hard dungeons in the box. The deck of dungeon cards is shuffled and you deal out 4 face down, representing doors. Spend 2 time (by discarding the top 2 cards of the deck) and flip up a door. There are combat and exploration encounters. The encounters revolve around rolling dice. You get starting dice based on your character. The cards have boxes which must be covered with dice to avoid taking health loss and/or losing more time. There are boxes (armor) that MUST be covered before any other boxes. There are also boxes that must be covered on the dungeon card which will get progressively harder each time you go through the deck. Once you finish a card, you get to either add it as an Item (giving you dice and/or health), a Skill (which gives you ways to mitigate die rolls or get more dice), Potions (spend a cube to heal or change dice) or XP which you need to level up. Leveling up lets you keep more Items and Skills and adds wild black dice to each encounter. After 3 runs through the deck, there is a Boss showdown. Essentially, this is a Combat encounter going more than 1 round. 

So, enough rules talk. This game is amazing! I love how you can run with different characters and different dungeons so there is quite a bit of replay ability. There is also a Campaign mode where you check off boxes for leveling up or finishing a level or beating a boss. As you check off boxes, you get access to cool abilities for your future adventures. And all of this is a small box! 

I was so pleased with this game that I went ahead and backed my first Kickstarter for the expansion. If you like solitaire gaming at all, you really must give this a try. It is that good. Ohhh, almost forgot, you can also play 2 player! The heroes are double sided and on the 2 player side the hero start with a few less starting dice and a different starting feat which usually helps your partner in some way. Easy Top 100 for me that will probably move up in the ratings as I play through and explore everything ODD has to offer.

As far as portable games I can sit down and play, this one is my current favorite. Not much setup time and I can churn out a play in about half an hour. I really like the dice mechanic and the ability to play encountered monster cards in large variety of ways. Not sure about the multiplayer aspect of it yet, only played it that way once thus far and it seemed tougher. It could be that we just didn't build right at the start.

...:::Approved for solitaire:::...

Mechanics are very good for a game so small. 
Dices, skills that allow you to modify your dices, or skills that add more dices to your encounters.
Minimalist RPG characters with standard skills (agility, strength, magic), nice encounters both traps and monsters.
All in all a neat game.

Solid little solo game that combines random dice chucking with some light decision making for a fast (15 min) satisfying diversion. There isn't enough variability to warrant tons of back-to-back plays, but it plays so quickly and is so compact I can easily see myself dashing off a quick game on a regular basis. The 2p however just doesn't work because there aren't really any decision points that warrant collaboration - stick to solo.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice compact, simple, lightweight card-based dice-driven co-op dungeon delve game with a really fun and engaging gameplay.
++ Good replayability coming from the several different combinaisons of the 5 different heroes and the 5 different dungeons/boss we can face off. Also, there is always the order the cards are drawn and the dice rolling of course!
++ Good generic fantasy theme that let players immerse themselves in this world thinking about their favorite IP (For me it's old school Final Fantasy on a Nintendo 8 bits).
++ I love the multi-use cards when we loot: Defeated monster or traps can be used as items, skills, potions or just plain XP.
++ I like the increase in difficulty as the game goes on, with the dungeons throwing more stuff at us as we level up (so the game is always challenging).
++ I also like that the game speed up as there is less and less cards in the dungeons deck (so you have less and less time to prepare for the boss fight).
++ Good graphic design of the multi-use cards, that is clean and clear.
++ Great price point for the good components and gameplay you have in this small and portable box.
++ Fun, easy to teach, fast to set-up and somewhat fast to play.
++ There is one expansion (soon) available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The game is a tiny bit more luck-based than I would like (but hey, there is card draw AND dice rolling in this game!), but with a few games played, you quickly learn how to mitigate this by keeping the best combinaison possible of items, skills, potions and XP. But yes, probably that if the dice really hate you, you will lose!
-- The rulebook is way too long for this game. It could have been streamlined more to explain everything in one format (instead of the 2 format is has right now, one being with illustration, and the other one being just text based). Also, a longer and more thorough FAQ could have been added to it with the pages saved from streamlining the rule book and this would have been useful as there is a lot of monsters/boss special abilities that could need some more explanation.
-- There is a lot of small rules that can be easily missed (for the first few games) or forgotten (if the game has not been played in a while) so a game can easily be not played correctly.
-- It's either a solo or a 2-players only co-op game, and for whatever reason, I don't like buying games with limited player count, even though I play a lot of my game just with my wife.
-- I prefer to play it solo than playing it at the 2-player count.
-- Being a co-op game, and having perfect knowledge of your partner character and dice roll, it is really prone to the Alpha Player Syndrome (where an experienced player can dictate other players everything to do to ensure a win).

I thought the solo game was enjoyable, but I prefer Dungeon Roll. ODD is a bit too heavy on the multiple layers of dice manipulation and placement--too many combos going on at once. I prefer the streamlined simplicity of Dungeon Roll.
On the other hand, it's just nice as a solo player to have a cheap game like this that is easily transported.

It might have been because I started late at night, but I had an inordinately difficult time getting comfortable with the game's system. The various symbols weren't always intuitive to me, and I found myself unsure about specific rules not addressed in the book. I suspect I'll enjoy the game more with time, however. I like the synergies of skills that helps mitigate the dice-based luck. There's also the promise of campaign play, which I've yet to delve into.

One thing I'm noticing is that the game doesn't play nearly as fast for me as you'd expect. I'm running into a lot of analysis paralysis: do I engage the encounter, how do I activate my skills, etc. For this game to rate higher, I'll need to play quicker.

This is everything I've ever wanted in a tabletop roguelike.  Simple pieces with complex behaviors, lots of opportunities to snatch victory from defeat, and several different playable characters and scenarios to change up the gameplay.  It's astonishing how much game fits in this tiny, tiny box.

This rating coming from a solo point of view:
A nice little push your luck game that is great to travel with. Although the game is a simple dice roller the theme of "hack-slash" through a dungeon is very much apparent. The loot after defeating (or attempting) is quite a good addition to the game to make it a little more than a dice roller.
I do find that playing 2 player is easier than solo as the three attempts of 2 player (on easy) have been successful while solo I have yet to finish the easy dungeon on solo without starting with extra skills.
The campaign thought is nice but it's little more than just a couple of extra skills which makes the harder dungeons easier to attempt.
Nice to fill in that 45 - 60 mins.
+ Simple rules to engage all ages
+ Dungeon theme shines through
+ Simple looting system that enhances the game

- Solo play different feel to 2 player (harder)
- Campaign system is poor

Overall - 6/10

Backed on Kickstarter -- After an initial awkward couple rounds and sorting through the booklet to determine what icon means what and making sure to burn "time" before each initial action, it became a quick streamlined dungeon romp that was a lot of fun throwing a ton of dice.  Pure co-op fun.  Lots of thought was put into the placement of skills, exp, equipment, and potions on each card so they stack to make the whole layout easy to read at a glance to see just what tools you have to work with.

Probably a top choice for one who prefers solo board/card games.  But I prefer multi-player games over solo games.  I was a little disappointed in this one.  Though not because it's a poor game.  On the contrary.  I probably had unrealistic expectations for it.  I wanted to get into solo games that could fill the desire to play games in general.  But as I stated, my heart lies in multi-player experiences.  So, if you're like me and have a couple of solo games that you already enjoy, you'll do just fine without this one.  But I imagine that it would be a solid hit for a "solo gamer."

I came home from work really wanting to play Darkest Dungeon with the new xpac (video game, great thematic dungeon crawler). My internet was down, so that was a no go. I decided to bust out One Deck Dungeon because I hadn't gotten around to playing it and figured it would kill some time.

I played it for four hours. Internet came back up and I didn't care. I was sucked into wanting to beat that dragon! The replay value is high, and I thought the campaign mode was a clever addition, as it gives you a chance to work towards improving your character even when you fail a dungeon run and have to start completely over (and you will fail...a lot).

Pretty fun time killer game. I wouldn't play it all the time, but if you're in the mood for some rogue-like dungeon crawling, it'll scratch that itch hard.

Printed the game before it released and it's the perfect "casual" dungeon crawler. There are enough choices to keep it interesting to casual players and enough replay for solo or co-op play.

Very cool idea and presentation. I love the small footprint it has on the table and the efficiency of the rules. Unfortunately for me the game is too luck dependent and repetitive.  

After a few plays it feels like a slog going through the same dungeon again. The dice manipulation abilities are nice in theory, but they don't do enough for me to be able to save a bad roll. I lost to a simple enemy because I rolled only 1s and 3s, which meant instant death.

I really wanted to like this game but it's just not for me.

My ten yr old agrees with me that the game mechanics here are amazing and well thought out. That the cards contain and track so much information so fluidly blows us away. Several times during the game we both said things like, "this is amazing." I am a long time tabletop game player and relatively new game designer, and my kid has made a couple games so far, so we both look for how games are put together and how they play. In addition to the cards, we love the puzzle and problem solving: should we use this card like this or like that, how should we group our dice? Some decisions were clear boons while others left us short. 
Rooms for improvement: The rules confused me at times and it was sometimes difficult to find the information we needed. Also, the easy dungeon was probably too easy, including the boss fight against the dragon. And, why is the dragon the boss of the easy dungeon? I can see an argument for a lich being more powerful than a dragon, but not a yeti or minotaur. 
We do have a question about campaign play. Do characters keep their skills and item cards from the previous dungeon when going to the next one or start from scratch? I can see possible reasons for both. 
Overall, we love this game (I played it solo before we played together) and eagerly await the expansion.
p.s. My kid is a boy and did not even notice the characters were all women. Thanks for being part of creating a world where your choice wouldn't be an issue.

EDIT: Ok, should've gone to bed, but I went to the forums and got answers to the question and saw a missed rule/misinterpretation or two that made game play easier. Thank you BGG Forum folks. I really should get more sleep...

After quite a few plays I've found the game to be heavily luck dependent and the puzzle of how to best allocate your dice to overcome an encounter to be not that interesting.

Played again - died at the same time the Boss died.  Better now that I know the rules well.  There is indeed a sense of progression as your character becomes stronger, but it gets too repetitive for my tastes.  Fun enough to keep in the collection, but I doubt I'll play it much more than a few times a year at most.

My enjoyment of this game went down quickly after just a few plays. It is a little repetitive and too brain burning for my taste. There are so many little calculations with dice values (which aren't particularly engaging) that I feel exhausted every time after a boss fight is over. The longer the game lasts the worse the feeling is. Very hard to win as well. I was only enjoying the campaign mode in hopes of upgrading my character enough to be able to defeat the first boss.

Cool little game! It feels almost too punishing at times, and the classes don't seem very well balanced (Rogue is too good). 
But it's a lot of fun with 1 or 2 people. I love how your characters level up, even if they do feel somewhat samey at the end of each game. Love the multi-purposing of the cards. Also love the female-only hero selection... it's a brave choice!

I have only played the two player version of this game and can imagine that it would be interesting as a solo game. The rules at first seemed a little quirky but once we got playing it smoothed out. Decent art and production value. Quite a bit of game with such a small footprint. The way the cards are used in the game is very clever and perhaps my favorite part of it. I think over time the cards may get a little boring, I think an expansion would really help with adding more variety.

This is exactly what I want in a solo game. 
1) One Minute Set Up time
2) Game play that does take up a whole night (can fit a game into my life easily).
3) Easy to understand and easy to include a wife or buddy
4) 3x3ft footprint on a table. (convenient)
5) A sheet to track character growth should you want to play it as an rpg. (compelling!)

Great Job.  The in-box characters and various ways to apply your loot (combined with the other positives ive listed) give me the experience I was hoping Arkham LCG would have been; a fast, varied experience where I spend more time playing then doing set up.  Should your delve go awry, you can try a different tactic and build your character in a totally different way in a matter of seconds. Seriously, can not sing this games praises enough.

2. It's overly complicated for what it offers. It's a "send your adventures into the dungeon game." There are lots of those. This one is purely co-op, but that's about all it has going for it over something like Boss Monster. 

So I'd play it again, but I don't expect my opinion to go in the "more positive" direction when I do.

This is a fairly simple and straightforward game. As a puzzle this is really good for a certain number of plays. Once you figure out the puzzle the game quickly becomes one dimensional. I found it to be , after just a few plays, to be a bit too easy for a coop game, even when I set the bar higher than the rulebook described.

One of the better co-op dice games available. 
It's a dice game with meaningful decisions. There's still a lot of randomness 
though. I wish there was some more ways to mitigate the randomness of the dice.
The game fit perfectly into the one hour light/medium weight co-op game category.
Thumbs up for the representation of women.

Had a blast playing a few games of 2 player tonight. Really captures the feel of rogue-like video games and translates well to cards & dice.

Good dice chucking game with very interesting mechanics. What makes my play interesting is that when you think you've strengthened yourself, you still struggling to defeat the next few foes! And when you eventually do, it's that much more satisfying.

Update on 18/12/17 - Sold as found this too much of a random dice chucking game. It's more dice placement rather than actual strategy gaming. Otherwise it's a fairly good solo BG.

Quick and easy to learn, and highly portable needing minimal space. Great game to carry around for yourself and 1 other person, or get two copies to play up to 4 people. Rouge like, but also has a campaign mode where you can build your characters up. For $20 it's a solid buy, and my only complaint is the dice are on the smaller side but that is to keep everything compact. Hopefully this gets some expansions.

Fast to set up and fun to play.  Lots of dice rolling which I enjoy.  Luck based but there is strategy in deciding which encounters to face.   Definitely NOT easy to beat.

Too difficult and dice reliant, which makes it unfun. Some of the characters are significantly better than others.

I enjoyed this one so much that after making a PNP version went off a bought a Gencon 15 beta copy. Nice component quality and fun little solo dungeon romp for myself. It's not bad with two players eithers but I got it mainly for days I want a quick solo fantasy game (normally I play Space Hulk Death Angel). Being a beta edition, it's missing a few mechanics that made into the final print (I think, I might be wrong), I'd be willing to trade for a newer copy (e.g. you have a spare but want something collectable).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Kickstarted; Enjoyable, fast play. The many ways you can take a card as loot (even if you fail the encounter) make for deceptively deep decision making. The scenarios are interesting and feel different enough, with the deeper levels of each scenario advancing the difficulty just enough to not let you feel entirely comfortable.

Rating could be higher, except for the game being very dependent on what cards you randomly flip over to face and for the dice at the beginning of the game. Bad rolls early on, before you've built up enough skills and potions to be able to mitigate bad rolls, can really sink you game quickly. In addition, having four enemies that you must choose from when you don't have a prayer of defeating any of them without severe consequences can be a bit annoying. It would be nice to be able to continue delving through until you find something you can beat, at the loss of the possibilities of some of the earlier doors that you opened.

Edit: The campaign mode is nice, though, for turning those frustrating runs into progress towards an upgrade. It would be nice to see a version of this game where you acquire gold and purchase items outside of the runs in order to achieve the same results, but the campaign mode as is provides some nice ways to tweak your character over time.

This is a print and play version of One Deck Dungeon. I enjoyed playing One Deck Dungeon. Each turn feels like a mini-puzzle trying to figure out the optimal placement of the dice. I really liked how when an encounter was completed, you would get multiple choices as to how to use that encounter to better your character or the party. Overall it is a fun game that I occasionally feel like playing.

Super digging this game.  Each turn is a fun little puzzle to solve.  The randomness of the dice is very manageable, which I like!  I love the female protagonists for progressive design AND that it makes a quick game of ODD very easy to sell to my wife and daughter, who don't feel locked into only the gender specific roles most games have.  

Love, love this game.  Can't wait for the expansion!!

Edit: just finished my ninth game with the daughter.  We are still so enamored with this game!  Challenging without being frustrating, exciting and full of variety.

Tried the PnP version.  First things first, the directions were horrendous.  I was never really sure if I was playing correctly or not.  The listed 10-30 minute play time must be a terrible joke or how long it takes to get through the 1st of the 3 floors.  I struggled through 2-3 hours before losing to hydra on turn 2.  I'm saddened I will never get the time back that I wasted on this boring game.  I was close to supporting them on kickstarter but thankfully they closed the campaign a few hours early and I missed out.  That was the best part of this game; not having to waste any money on it.  Dungeon crawlers are adventurous and fun but this game takes the enjoyment completely out of it.  Finally, I will end with the lack of replayability...it has none.  Oh, I'm sorry, you can play a different dungeon.  Whoopee!  The one deck aspect of it makes it a 2 or 3 time run through before you are bored out of your mind with the repetitive nature.  This game is for young adolescence at best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I like adventure games in theory, I don't care for the common mechanics of drawing a card, seeing what it is, and defeating it with modified dice rolls. This is the basic format for 4 out of 5 adventure games, it seems, and I usually need something a little more creative than that to keep me engaged. One Deck Dungeon is just such a game, but the dice management mechanics and the portability for travel makes this one a keeper for now. I don't have the patience for elaborate solo games, but I do like to keep some portable quickies and this is different enough from the others I own.

The 5 heroes to choose from have three stats - Fighting, Agiliy, and Magic. These stats determine the basic composition of your dice pool, which can be increased as you defeat creatures. Players pick a hero and work through the adventure deck 3 times and then must defeat the boss selected at the beginning of the game. Players must explore to get four doors face down in front of them and then each turn open a door and decide whether to face what is behind - which can be either a creature or a trap. Traps give you two options, each of which focus on using a single ability to defeat. Creatures always require multiple dice values of at least two abilities to defeat. If you manage to defeat a card, you can use it as an item to increase your dice pools, as a skill to give you a special ability, as experience towards increasing a level (which increases the number of items and skills you can have), or sometimes as a potion with powerful abilities but limited uses. This creates a nice, simple decision space for how to evolve your character in prep for the bigger challenges. Every trap and creature had multiple boxes of specific dice types and values. If you are not killed, you always get the benefit for facing a creature, but for every box you cannot assign dice to, you lose either life or time, which hastens you to the boss fight at the cost of development time. 

All of this makes for a straightforward game with decent enough amount of decisions. I've enjoyed my plays of it this month, but I have yet to win on the "easiest" dungeon. You can also play with two players and when you do, both characters chosen are inherently weaker to keep the game balanced. This is really a solo game, though. As a two-player co-op, I think it falls well short of other games on the market. Rated for solo play only.

Played twice and loved it both times! It's fun working together with someone to solve these little puzzles and work towards the final boss.

The theme is a matter of taste (I like it). But when you look at the game's mechanic/design, you can only take your hat off: Almost all of a dungeon crawler's aspects (exploring, descending, leveling, combat, traps, items, potions, experience etc.) are efficiently crammed on just playing cards. A full game with a small footprint. That said, you have to love dice - which I do - but it doesn't feel random or too luck based. What would make this game absolutely perfect would be a better manual and a playing mat.

Favorite game mechanics: When you defeat an encounter you choose to take its Item, EXP, or Skill by exposing that side of the card under your player mat. This adds interesting choices and character development. Also, the tear-off sheets are an elegantly simple way to add a legacy component to the game.

Least favorite game mechanic: 2 player mode is essentially the same thing as 1 player mode because the players' dice are a shared pool.

A small box game with plots of thinking and replayability. Heroes move through three levels of a dungeon, defeating monsters and traps to gain items, skills, and experience. This helps prepare the heroes for a big battle at the end of the game. The cards in this game have multiple uses, which forces players to make some difficult decisions. The game also includes campaign play.

The game presents you a little puzzle every level and you need to figure out the optimal way to beat it and then you decide which way the loot will help you more. People say the best move is obvious but I found it is not that clear and sometimes doing things in a different order makes for a better turn. Need more plays to make a better decision but I like this game after the first play.

This is a fantastic little game. Yes, it involves rolling dice and that means that there is some luck involved; especially early in the game, but once your heroes gather some items and skills there are many way to mitigate and work around the luck of the dice. There are so many things to like about this game and it captures the theme really well and does it with only one deck of cards, some tokens and a bunch of cool, little dice. The only downside is that I want more heroes, more monsters, more traps, more loot, more, more, more!

RATING: 3
KS'd - On the fence on this. Feel like it's closer to a 2-3 range. I *want* to like this game. Just kinda boring. Basically just getting defeated many times until you get lucky with rolls. Burning through the deck for 'time' is pretty ... dumb? Best word I can come up with. Feels like I'm missing most of the game and burning cards more than anything else. A different mechanic for this would have been better imo. Seems like maybe I'd be better to just shuffle the stairs into the bottom half of the deck or something, pretty much anything really. 

Really has me kinda upset how much I WANT to like this game. I KS'd it so I would really prefer a game I'd enjoy playing.

It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, thematically for sure, that you die so often in a single dungeon and then just start again but with more experience. You should be able to beat the beginning dungeons pretty easily but have a hard time as the campaign advances and the dungeons get harder. It should be difficult to complete a campaign with a single character, not a single dungeon. So what in a full campaign (from first dungeon to last dungeon) you die like 50 times? Yeah, that seems right. Once your character dies you should be starting a new character and starting at dungeon 1 again and trying to make your way through the dungeons again until you win or die. You could even have a 'resurrect' potion that is hard to get with the way you spend "time".  But it would cut you a break possibly if you got it. 

I really do like the item/skill/potion/exp mechanic here. This is by far the best part of the game, the art is great too though. I feel like this is sooo close to being a home run for me and I think that's what upsets me the most. I'm going to keep trying it hoping that something will click fro me and turn it into a 7-8 range game like many reviews here.

I've been doing the campaign to "build my hero up". Instead of making you need to do this and loose 6-7 games until you are stronger the game just should have been toned down a little. It just too random for me. I was hoping after a few weeks I could bump this to a 6 (at least) I just feel like now I should make it a 2 I'll settle for a 3. 

Really bummed out about this game, had high hopes for fun, instead its just a death factory and the "official" answer is to play a easier version of it by giving yourself experience you didn't actually earn to level up faster. My solution would have been to  make it on a "normal" setting (no rule changes) make it reasonable. To me the rules ARE the "normal" version of the game.

Only played this solo 

I enjoy this for a quick solo game.  Quick setup, relatively quick play-thru and doesn't require a tremendous amount of real estate to actually play a game (though you're not going to get a game played on the tray of a airline).

This one is soon to be an app, and honestly I do see myself playing that more when it comes out then the physical copy (barring the digital game being badly done), but enjoyable for what it is.

My favorite game EVER, having played 300+ games.

not for sale in europe yet and would like an expansion to boot. The problem with the game is that it takes at least 1.5-2 hours to descend down to and defeat the boss. The reason is that eventually you will be throwing 15 dice and there are so many combinations each encounter becomes a puzzle that takes some minutes to solve. You can't really save a state to play another day.

Also the campaign rules are a mystery to me - how to use

Cute art and game idea, but, it is too luck based.
If you roll crap, you will not reach the third dungeon level.
And that time effect was a bit annoying.

UPDATE: v1.5 Patch Notes
After the balance update to the cute game, i will give this game again a try.
And with the standalone expansion.
I hope i dont roll to crap, and if so i could adjust my dice better now.
From 4 to 6.0 at the moment.
Good luck

This game is good for about one hour of fun, ever.  The initial stages of the game, as you work your way down through the levels of the dungeon, are fun the first time you play.  After that, things fall apart rapidly.

After playing your way through three levels of dungeons, you get to the boss.  This is where the designers reveal that they have absolutely no understanding of probabilities, which is a fatal flaw when designing a dice-based game.  The odds of beating a boss and winning the game are astronomical.  At first I thought that I was just having bad luck, but then I did the math and realized that I would have had to make ridiculously good rolls to win.  Maybe it's different if you're playing with multiple players instead of solo, but in that case, the designers did a lousy job with the rules specifically designed for one player.

After my initial frustration, I tried a few different bosses, and discovered two things: first, it doesn't matter which boss you pick, beating the boss is about ten times harder than any other monster.  Second, I learned that the game rapidly gets boring and repetitive; the first time I played, I at least had fun until the boss, but subsequent play-throughs felt like chores from start to finish.

I really wanted to like this game: I love the idea of card-based adventure and RPG games.  Unfortunately, I was left entirely disappointed.  I can only recommend this game to you if you are a glutton for punishment.   My copy is going in the trash--it's so bad that I wouldn't even want to inflict it on a stranger for free.

Another excellent solo-able game that scratches my dungeon delving itch. It's easy to lose the order of which dice belong to which character (it's important to keep them separate) as you try to work out the perfect combo for your dice. That's definitely a fiddle, but otherwise I love it, and look forward to the imminent expansion.

Eeee! Really hooked me with the 2 player experience. Can't wait to play more.

Avoiding solo play to share the experience (pun intended?) with my partner, but I would totally recommend it for light solo. Lots of dice, fun progression, light challenges but not easy. A bit arithmetic heavy, if that's a thing with adding handfuls of d6s and essentially solving small addition problems each encounter.

Replayability is iffy... But the campaign and leveling features have me hooked and invested.

I found the game to be decent for what it is.  The two player mode feels more like an afterthought while the solo play is decent.

My only issue is there isn't that much decision making involved.  Most of the game is heavily reliant on the dice and the choices are very obvious on what you need to do.  Instead of a solo game that forces you to make tough decisions, like Warfighter, it's a game where you're just along for the ride.

I really like this game. I like so many things about it: the theme, the way it simulates a roguelike in card game form, the nods to D&D, the optimization puzzle, the use of randomness, the many ways to mitigate that randomness, the simplicity of setup and teardown, the quality of the components, the tiny box that takes up no space on my desk, the all-female cast, and just the overall vibe. What a great little game!

There's so much variety in the combination of characters, encounters, encounter order, loot choices, and bosses that running through the same deck three times per game doesn't seem like it will get old anytime soon. Rather, like a roguelike, I'll learn what works for each hero based on repeat exposure to what could be out there (in the deck).

Based on my first solo play, it strikes me as somehow managing to balance punishing difficulty (I lost in round one of the boss fight, and nearly lost twice before that) and a relaxed "play-feel." It's an unusual -- and deeply enjoyable -- mix.

---

Three plays in, still loving it. I've learned to be very careful about the cards, since they're all multipurpose and some apply differently in a solo vs. two-player game. I accidentally played my second game as the 2P warrior and lost badly (surprise!), and I've definitely mixed up the traps/combat column on the floor card when resolving encounters.

My third play was a win. I went into the boss fight with max health, full items, full skills, and roundly trounced the dragon. I'm curious to see if that game's approach (maximize dice rolled, then skills, and level if they're maxed) holds up for a level 2 dungeon.

RATING: 4
I mean it's OK.  I've played two dungeons and already feel like I've seen the same cards too much.  I would have given it a 6 except the dice are absolute crap- it really deserves more stars off for that  because a game that's core is dice that requires you to fiddle with all the dice should really have decent dice.  The pips on at least a third of my dice have plastic gobs in them but that wouldn't even matter because it doesn't affect game play.  What affects it is that the dice are highly rounded such that when you touch them or brush them you flop over.  Hell the greatest challenge in this game is probably remembering what all the dice your roll are because you can't move them without losing rolls.  It's really freaking maddening.

The rules are somewhat convoluted, I'm probably still playing slightly wrong but in any case it wasn't the amazing adventure I expected, not at all.  Going to save for co-op play to see if that improves anything.

RATING: 2
The game looks great.  Artwork is excellent and the component quality is very good.  But...every single hero picture is female.  Every single one.  

Not a single male representation.  In this industry full of self-appointed 'social justice warriors' clamoring for the gaming hobby to be 'inclusive', this smacks of blatant sexism; not to mention outright hypocrisy.  When every single depiction of a hero in a game is female...and it's an 'adventure game', and not a single male is depicted, this isn't a mistake or oversight.  It's an SJW political statement.

'Inclusive' means all-inclusive.  Read it again if you need to.

For this reason, the game will never be more than a 2, and won't be brought out to the table again, at least until the liberal designer corrects the inherent sexism in the artwork and redesigns the game to be truly inclusive.

As it stands now, the game should have been titled, "One Sex Dungeon".

SOLD:  I finally got rid of this garbage game.

This is one of the best games I have ever played and although it probably won't stay permanently in my top ten as i will obviously play it to death. It deserves an ovation.

The design is excellent the way you explore the deck is fresh, battle is simple but provides good choices, the multi use cards is a thing of genius and the build up to the boss is fantastioc.
+ the campaign is simple but hugely effective.

More plays in and have tried a couple of characters, I still find it very enjoyable!  Dice chucking, but with a puzzle twist.  Challenging, but workable if you think things through a little.  I like that the challenge is there from a start, but the game has little to no learning curve (I did ok on my first play by thinking things through, but because I was new made some bad decisions that were irrecoverable...won my second play through, but by the skin of my teeth).  Now I have a few more plays and only about 20% win percentage but know the decisions that cost me where I probably would have won if I didn't make the bad decisions or miss something that I didn't realize until later...and of course some rolls not ending up how they have to, but I still had a path to victory in most cases.

Customized PnP version. I like the art in this game and I enjoy chucking dice. The campaign mode definitely adds replayability to the game - even in losing, not all is lost.

It's not Mage knight, but overall, it's still a decent solo-player experience!

Only played this solo. Wonder if my rating would go up if I played it cooperatively like it's supposed to be played? I personally love all the separate bits this game is comprised of (dice rolling, dungeon theme, powerful female characters), but because all moves are predicated on the results of dice - and perhaps I didn't interpret the rules correctly - I found it very difficult to even get past the first floor of the first level. This game also makes it perilously easy and inviting to cheat during solo mode (Oh, lemme just re-roll that, shall I?) so although I really had high hopes for this, it's not currently on my must-play roster.

A pretty clever and fast design. Gives you a rewarding pacing - use the beaten card to level-up (so to increase your available slots), gain new skills, or gain new dice to roll. Cool.

It's a bit puzzl-y in the mix-and-match process, which is the heart of the game (aka "dice manipulation"), but it's so fast that it's ok.

Currently enjoying this little dice-rolling dungeon crawler as a solo game.  Not sure how it would play with 2 players, would be interesting to give it a go.  Obviously a lot of luck is required with the dice rolls and the card draws.  It's a nice, snappy game though so luck factor hurts less and once you get some skills/items you can (potentially) negate some of the bad rolls.

What a fun game!  I've played it solo and 2-player, and really enjoyed it.  It's sort of a cross between Steampunk Rally and Dungeon, in gameplay.  Everything is represented by a single deck of cards.  You use "time" to get things done, and this is represented by burning two cards at the start of every round.  Then you get one action - either placing doors or opening/encountering them.  You can flee a door with no consequences.  Encounters are resolved by rolling and placing dice.  When the deck is empty, the level is done, and you must descend to the next level or take a potential health hit for lingering.  After three levels, you fight the boss and if you kill him, you win.  It's about an hour to play, and has a campaign mode as well, where your character can improve between sessions - even if you don't happen to survive a dungeon!

Neat idea for a game. For being a gimmick, One Deck Dungeon really does feel like a dungeon in a single deck of cards. The game does have a few drawbacks that keep it from being rated higher though. One is that the rule book is awful. Seriously, Asmadi, get someone to write clearer rule books. This game would have made a much better first impression with a well-worded explanation in the box. Also, and this doesn't really affect my rating, but the fact that all the characters are female is a little odd to me. It feels like the designer was trying to make a political statement, which I'm not a fan of in games. I don't mind female characters, but at least give people the option of male characters also.

Anyway...One Deck Dungeon is a really good game. In fact, it's one of the best solo games I've played in awhile. It doesn't take up a ton of table space, it has the Roll For It mechanism that I enjoy, and the game utilizes multi-use cards in a way that works well. There are parts of it that are a little more fiddly than I'd like, but most of that could probably be explained away with the poor rules. Seriously...it's laughable that the rule book in the most recent version is twice as long JUST BECAUSE THEY REITERATED THE RULES AGAIN! Regardless, if you can muddle your way through the rules, this is a great solo game.

Solo game. Character travels through the dungeon opening doors and fighting monsters by throwing dice to determine the outcomes. Each character has different abilities but its a hard game to win.

Love it! While heavily dice-based, there are quite a lot of ways to allocate them. After defeating a trap or monster, there are decisions about whether to go for a skill, an item (an extra die), or experience points. Potions buy you time with healing or skills. Time is against you -- and every turn of a card represents passing time. Well-designed and -presented -- and amazingly deep for a small-box game.

Really enjoying this after a couple of solo playthroughs. Card/dice-based game that's easy to learn but not easy to beat. You encounter monsters and traps, and to defeat them you roll dice of various colors that represent stats (strength, agility, magic); the number of dice you get of each color depends on the hero class you pick. Skills can also give you black "heroic" dice that can be used as any color (and you can convert two colored dice to a single heroic die). Then you use the dice to fill various boxes on the monster/trap and the dungeon itself, trying to beat certain values in each box in order to avoid losing health or time. After the encounter, you gain the monster/trap as loot that you can use as either an item (to get more dice of a given color), a skill/potion that lets you modify rolls or do other effects, or XP to level up. There's even a campaign mode that lets you gain more starting skills over time. A lot of game in a little box.

I wrote a long comment here but it didn't save. In short, the game mechanics feel abstract but it still manages to capture the roguelike feeling. It's sometimes brutally hard and there's a lot of content in One Deck Dungeons box. 


Overall I enjoy the game but there's nothing extraordinary about it except its simplicity.

This is a great small box game! I love the growing character, and the increasing challenge. I have only won twice (dragon both times), but I am doing the campaign mode now, so hopefully I can stand a chance against the 2 dot and 3 dot bosses!

I'm having fun with this one so far.  I like that it's not always immediately obvious how to allocate your dice, especially after you have acquired more skills and potions.  It's really easy to set up and start playing.

Currently, this is very near my ideal for a game: tiny, heroic fantasy theme, solo or co-op play, packed with features, lots of character-building, persistent growth in a campaign mode...and affirming women in a really respectful way I think! What's not to love?

I love this game. My girlfriend loves it to. Anytime we try to deside what to play she leans twords this game. It is a great one player game and a better co-operative game. You pick characters with typical tropes like warrior, thief, or wizard. Each with unique skills and strengths. You work down three lvls, getting stronger with more die rolled and abilities, to finally face off against the boss. With a deck of monsters that you shuffle every lvl (and every game) and each monster give you different skills and abilities (even if its the same goblin monster) every game feels different.

My only negative is it only works for 1-2 players or 4 players with two games combined (i have never tied the 4 player mode).

I highly recommend this game. 
PS- hint of advice go for abilities that give an automatic 6 they are life savers!

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]Biggest surprise of the month for me by far. I keep trying different solo games and haven't found one that I not only enjoyed, but is relatively easy to set up. I am a fan of the Omniverse games, but set up can be a deterrent to my playing the game. And now on to One Deck Dungeon's highlights: 

- Quick, easy set up. You can be up and running in a couple of minutes.
- Mostly straightforward rules, there is a good FAQ on the publisher's website to help with some common rules questions.  
- There are a lot of decisions to be made in a relatively short game [i](probably around 30 minutes)[/i].
- The variety of characters and upgrades you can get throughout game play gives this game have some serious legs.
- The time mechanic forces you to keep moving and sets the tempo for the game, you always feel the time crunch in this game which forces you to gamble sometimes.
- The dice mechanics are clever and make solving each encounter  a puzzle where you have to figure out how to manipulate your dice to overcome monsters and traps without taking too much damage or wasting a lot of time.
- And finally, the desighner was able to capture the feeling of old school rogue likes in a card game!

*So far I've only played one off games, but I am looking forward to sticking with a character in the campaign mode and being able to level them up after each dungeon run.[/i]

"Tiny-box dungeon crawl for 1 or 2 players. The multi-use cards are brilliant, and the dice system works quite well. It is very random, but there are a surprising number of difficult decisions, and I can definitely see how one could improve their skill over time."

What I like:
- Choosing to gain loot as items, skills/potions, or XP
- Surprising number of interesting decisions
- Plays quickly
- Tiny box, with good quality components
- Female heroes

What I don't like:
- There are a couple rules that seem hard to remember
- With no rerolls, and the luck of the card draw, it's pretty random
- It's intended to be really hard to win
- Limited to 2 players (or 4 if you have 2 copies of the game)

In my first play, I managed to survive to face the final boss, which was satisfying. Until I realized the several rules errors I made in my favor, so I probably didn't really get that far. My second play (at normal difficulty) was a crushing defeat. But my third and fourth, on easy mode, were easy wins. 

I haven't tried the campaign mode yet.

Excellent, fun Dungeon bash for one or two players ...the 1.5 rule book has cleared up a lot of minor issues for us ...
It's hard even on easy level ...but that maybe because our first game was misplayed mea culpa as I didn't read the rule book well enough ...
Looking forward to our next adventure and would certainly buy any forth coming expansions ...
One negative  ...I hope they release a larger box with the expansion so it can all be stored together sleeved ...

Nice light solo player. Quick set up and take down and some very short games ( I once died on the first card) mean you will find yourself visiting this one time and again. Love adding beaten cards as items and skills and really looking forward to my next play of this. Not crazy on the artwork though...

RATING: 6
Addictive but so frustrating. There's so little you can do to influence outcomes, especially at the beginning. It's a game where you can easily die, or all but die, on the very first turn. Even as you acquire dice, you descend a floor, so the game stays one step ahead of you. The characters are not evenly balanced at all. The boss fights are seemingly impossible, requiring roll after roll of sixes, with very very few ways to reliably manipulate the dice. There's a simplicity of set-up that I like--shuffle up and go!--but the choices are so limited.

RATING: 7
I did the PnP, which worked out alright. The cards weren't perfectly lined up, so a lot of my cards have white borders on one edge and/or missing borders on a potentially different edge. It's not that big of a deal, though, and it's still quite playable (and I think it was more of a printer issue than the file not being properly laid out).

Gameplay is challenging, but I like it a lot. I like how the combat works and how your dice are used. The fact that beaten enemies can be used as an item, a skill/potion, or for EXP is quite nice and flexible.
I feel it goes by too quick somehow. For the beginner dungeon, almost half of the deck is already discarded before I even get to start. I suppose I could always try house-ruling that I only discard 1 card before exploring, but I could myself getting too powerful as a result.

I have lost a few times, but that is to be expected. I have also won, and it feels great when you do. I will start a campaign sometime in the near future.

A dungeon crawler simplified into a deck of cards and some dice? Interested. So after playing this a few times and finally getting the rules down, I'm actually enjoying this one quite a bit. Sure it has its flaws, but it's so quick (and deadly) that it doesn't really hurt the game in the end. The game is rather lucky with how the dice roll and the abilities and monsters you fight, but it really feels like a rogue-like dungeon crawler. You also have the tense decision to take a card for XP, as an Item or as the skill. All are great, but you also want all 3. Plays great with 2 (my preferred play count) and plays excellent solo.

Unfortunately for most Asmadi games, a newer edition fixes some of the errors as well as rebalances the cards. I wasn't as keen on the game as I am now, so I skipped on the upgrade kit during the kickstarter. If I can find that and the expansion together, I will purchase it, but I'm not sure I want to buy the base game all over.

Roguelike? Check.

Seemed perfect for me. 
In playing, it is a unique reversal that once you decide on an encounter, you are locked in and it is already done. But your choices involve not how much damage you do, but how much damage you want to mitigate.

1P is super hard - actual roguelike. Then, playing with 2P makes it seem almost too easy... Still have hard decisions, but I may be playing wrong. In roguelikes I expect to die most of the time.

I kickstarted this game and it's expansion. I enjoy ODD, the system is pretty well thought out for optimizing a small number of cards. The art is attractive and it is an interesting twist that all of the heroes are female. A nice bit of variety, not too difficult to learn, and relatively quick to play. For a fantasy quick fix, this is a good option.

Very enjoyable but ultimately unfulfilling game.  Light choices make for a pleasant time-passer with a little press your luck.  The use of so many dice precludes it replacing an Onirim style game as a traveler's 1P goto.  Desperately needs a "3rd dimension" component to add the illusion of choice for the player.  Immediate thoughts: damage types, actual puzzles instead of dice placement for traps (simple math problems), some sort of timed element, more press your luck elements.

I am looking forward to trying this. I've contemplated from time to time the idea of a solitaire card game that evokes the decision making and experience of RPG dungeon delving. Having played other Asmadi/Cieslik games that involve tucking cards under a player board, I can see how this mechanic could be used to accumulate experience, traits, equipment, and treasure as a character proceeds through a dungeon. Of course there are many other factors needed to reproduce the mystery and excitement of RPG dungeon delving, but this looks very promising. Can't wait!

surprising full of decisions and satisfying difficult as a solo or 2-player game

In general, I think this is how dice should be used in games -- as an input variable (roll then choose allocations/actions) rather than as an output variable (choose action then roll for success).  They still force you to deal with uncertainty and risk, but your interaction with that risk is about tactical reaction rather than probability calculations.

This game is all right. An interesting puzzle game based on dice rolling and manipulation. The concepts are easy enough to grasp but beyond the puzzles I don't feel like there is a ton of "game" there. In defense of the game I have not tried playing through a campaign yet so maybe there is more to it. This game also feels like to takes too long for the amount of content/fun there is. It's okay sometimes but certainly not my favorite game.

One of the most enjoyable solo games I have, and probably my favorite dungeon crawler at the moment. It's a lot of fun working out the puzzle of how to manipulate the dice on the encounters to beat the challenges, and when the dice don't go your way, what sort of damage I'm willing to accept. I also like how there are multiple dungeons with different effects and abilities, and the campaign mode looks interesting as well, where you play multiple times and, depending on how well you do, unlock new abilities. I also love that they managed to fit all this in, along with a bunch of dice, into a tiny box, so it's super portable.

Received via Amazon in February, 2017.

This is a nice, light solitaire game.  I'm not sure if it was worth the $20 I paid, but I'm probably going to get more hours out of this little game than most of my bigger, more expensive ones.  

There's a nice combination of randomness and decision-making to make the game feel fresh and interesting each time.   The resolution mechanic (of covering up targets with differently colored dice) is pretty darn satisfying and works well for a game of this nature.  While the theme is incredibly generic, I do appreciate that all the heroes are female, and I got some chuckles watching my Paladin die from failing to jump across a spiked pit. 

My issues:
1.  I do worry about replayability.  It has the potential to feel a little samey, esp. if you play multiple times in a row.  I suspect the best way to play this game will be 1-3x per month, and not to gorge on it too much in one sitting.
2.  Placing loot cards (esp items) underneath your hero in two directions gets a bit messy and finicky as you progress through the game.
3.  It's actually pretty easy, for such a light game, to miss some key rules or card effects that nullify a particular run-through.  Some of this, I suspect, has to do with the graphical design of the game, and some with a somewhat confusing rulebook.
4.  I'm not thrilled with some of the hero's special abilities, as printed.  Seems like some of these could have used some additional playtesting/tweaking.  I may need to house-rule a couple.

Five playthroughs now, 3 solo, 2 with my teenager. It's a fun puzzle solo but even more fun with a partner. I'm not sure how long this will last but I have a feeling it has decent legs. The rules could be clearer but the game is simple enough to grasp fairly quickly. This leaves all your energy for trying to puzzle out how you should apply those pesky dice. One quibble is it's easy to forget some of the rules (like certain skills only apply in combat, others only vs. traps).

Oct 2017 - Addendum: Still liking the game. Just noticed some other reviewers bothered by the fact that all the characters are female. So funny. My son and I didn't mind, we were too busy killing monsters. The things that make some poor sensitive men upset just amazes me. I'm manly enough (grunt grunt, belch) to not feel my manhood is threatened by playing a female character.

Not enough content to last very long.  You go through the same small deck of monsters over and over for each 'floor' of the dungeon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a small form factor dungeon crawler played with, as the name indicates, a single deck.  This is a pretty popular gimmick among board and card games lately, that is take a game design that might otherwise be a "big box" game and shrink it down to as small as you can while trying to still offer a decent amount of content and game depth.

In this case it is dungeon crawlers, typically long and sprawling games with lots of content but played with a single deck.  In this game you reveal cards and choose which challenges to take on and how to improve your characters when they are defeated.  Often you have choices between adding more dice to your repertoire, new abilities, potion types, or simply experience toward leveling up your party.

I don't mind the small form factor here.  There is still a decent amount of content here and number of decisions.  At least it feels that way after a single play.  This is, after all, a single deck of cards.  I think this game would get stale quite quickly, something that isn't typically a problem with most dungeon crawlers.  This was a fun game that I would play occasionally and it does fit in a nice 30-45 minute window.  I just prefer other small form factor games and if this is the kind of game I want to play I prefer something much meatier.

RATING: 5
There are not so many options for solo gaming. This one is "not bad". Too much luck, though, and the art is sub-par in my humble opinion, but there are still much worse options out there if you want to play a solo RPG... It's a detail, but I am not sure why there are no male characters. It sounds as weird to me as having only male characters...

Decently fun. Doesn't feel too much like a dungeon crawl, more like a puzzle. Figure out how whether to use successful encounters as items, abilities, or XP; how to divide up damage; and how to split up dice rolls all just leads to it feeling like a solo game split up between two people.

Good solo game, difficult, takes multiple efforts to beat a dungeon and is suitable for someone who likes challenges.

- very difficult, frustrating and with detrimental effect when you roll bad dice
+ has clever mechanics to ameliorate the above
+ choosing what to do the loot will require careful thinking and planning 

Little replay value with both the same character AND dungeon, ONCE you manage to beat that dungeon. Never played 2p version.

One Deck Dungeon is a small dice chucking game that didn't really work for me. Aesthetically, the illustrations look like a teenage Canadian version of anime, and the choice to have ALL characters female and of different ethnicities further hampers the old world feel with a modern, 2016 agenda. Additionally, the lightweight, rounded dice fly everywhere and from a tactile point of view, this feels like I'm throwing marbles rather than rolling dice.

I like the idea of turning over doors to see what is inside and then facing the monster or traps--and that thematic conceit is what makes this game slightly different than just mere accounting. But this idea is injured greatly by perhaps the worst/least thematic mechanic I've come across in a game like this: even if the monster or trap badly injures the heroine, the heroine claims the loot of that monster or trap in a "success". While one can intellectualize this as an abstraction of a back and forth combat, if my character gets whipped by a monster in battle, I don't want to gain that monster's treasure.  For the major part of this game, I am rolling dice or slotting dice into little boxes, and pretty soon, this starts to feel like more of an abacus than a game.  

I'd like a cool solo adventure game that does not take up the setup time, playing time, or space of Perdition's Mouth, Shadows of Brimstone, Runebound (3rd), or Mage Knight (all of which I enjoy and recommend), but One Deck Dungeon is not the one for me, nor is it even as enjoyable as the other small dice chuckers that I've played like Space Hulk or Tiny Epic Galaxies.

I often play this as a solitaire game, but I have played with a few other people.

The gameplay of One Deck Dungeon (ODD) comes the closest of any game I've played to capturing the feel of a dungeon crawl in a card game format.

There is a wonderful interplay been the encounters, character power-ups and "game clock" that are all represented as card in the deck.  Waste too much time fleeing from monsters and you will be unprepared for the lower level dungeons.

Be warned, total party kills are not uncommon in this game.

I don't play this every day, but I do like it a lot.

As a solo offering, One Deck Dungeon offers satisfying fidelity for very little overhead by replicating the best and worst of the roguelike genre. Belligerent randomness, the occasional burst of brilliance as you dodge death, and plenty of infuriating defeats, all wrapped together with persistent characters who grow more conniving and open the gates to ever-less-fair dungeons.

RATING: 6
An interesting little game... You can run it with a friend or in solitaire, it's cheap, it fits in a decent sizes pocket, not too hard to learn/teach, some decent variation, sufficiently complex/nerdy... a lot of love, really. That said, it has some issues too... It feels a little long, sometimes. You take most of your kickings early on, then are an unstoppable engine of destruction if you live past floor 2. At this point, all future fights are basically forgone conclusion/formality, but you HAVE to roll them out anyway because how FAST you clear them is still an important factor. The fun factor thus drops off hard late game. Ultimately, not a total waste, but this is a good travel/solitaire game in a pinch... if you're at home with your collection, hopefully you own something better?

RATING: 5
First play impression: Not bad. The gameplay itself is really puzzle-y as you figure out the best way to use your dice. The multi-use cards make for some nice decisions as there usually isn't a "best" way to use them, so you just make a decision and see how it pans out.

One issue is replayability. There are multiple characters and bosses and all of that stuff to add variety, but if the gameplay isn't compelling then replayability will always suffer. That's the case here as the game feels like it will become repetitive quickly. You play through the same deck a few times, you face the same types of monsters and traps, and you puzzle out the best way to use your dice over and over. While the game isn't very long, it still feels a little too long for what it is.

The luck of the dice can also be an issue. Sure there are several abilities that let you reroll, roll more dice, and exchange to get better dice, but if you roll all low numbers you're still at a disadvantage. A lot of modern games have incorporated ways to use both low and high value dice, but in this game you want to roll sixes at all times.

Still, I would play again if asked.

I changed my score.  I hated it before, but everyone loved it so much that I dug it out to give it another try.  Turns out when I played?  I missed a key rule that made the game make a LOT more sense (trading two dice for a hero die).  Now, okay.  The game is considerably better.  Still not a huge fan, I really really dislike the time mechanic.  I am going to play a few more rounds, see how I feel about it.  Maybe my score will change.

I've been wanting to play this for a while, and thus far I'm finding it interesting, if challenging - it took me ten games to win my first one, but I think I was unclear on several rules. 

I like the time mechanic but sometimes forget to flip the cards at the start of each turn, and I also keep forgetting that the dungeon card itself has boxes that need to be filled first (probably because it's not attached to the monster or peril card). I suspect this will improve with practice. 

A solitaire app that took care of the issues mentioned above automatically would make a great game and would be a definite buy for me.

One Deck Dungeon supplies a brutally challenging and fun filled delve into solo adventuring.  Do not let the weight rating fool you, one wrong move and your Hero will be just another skeleton littering the dusty warn dungeon flood.  But that's ok, set-up is easy and the gameplay is fast and furious so very soon you will be immersed in the adventure again!

A great little solo dungeon crawl. If you like rolling a lot of dice, then great! If you don't, well, you get a lot of ways to manipulate them. Lots of choices and options that only grow as you go deeper into the dungeon. There's a lot more going on in this game than you might expect, and multiple character types, a big deck of threats/loot, and a campaign mode give this game some serious longevity.

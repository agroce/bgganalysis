RATING: 6
Warband fits what I am looking for in my collection. It reminds me of a Martin Wallace design, Euro with theme. Also, it fits my interest in an army fighting together but generals battling each other for glory. 

It is easy to teach and can finish within an 60 to 90 minutes (3 players or less) which makes it a great Meetup game. The interaction is also very good as there is no way one person can do everything and everybody has to piggyback on every other players actions. In addition, I bought Darkmoon and Warbands and Warbands was far superior in quality compared to the professional company produced Darkmoon.

Downsides is the game can be mean (which I don't mind) but that can be reduced by a change of deck composition a bit and if one wants to optimize, AP can be a issue as you have to wait for your turn to maximize decision making due to the results of the other players actions. Thus this also means that at 5 players, the game can be overly long and reason why I prefer it at max 4 players. 

Overall to me I am happy with the purchase which is always a good thing.

RATING: 7
I like the feel of struggling and area control. 

My first play with elves aren't very successful...

Component: Instead of meeples, captain symbols should really be stars because it is less distracting/confusing and I'm ordering some right away.

RATING: 5
A fairly dull, low-complexity area majority-type euro. The dramatic fantasy scene on the game box is mostly absent in the game itself. The "battles" take place on an austere board that looks like a flow chart (look at the right side of the banner image at the top of this page) and are very abstract. The "enemies" you face are cards with symbols and no artwork. Rulebook was poor when it came to various rules ambiguities. If you're looking for an abstract euro, the mechanics are serviceable. If you're looking for a thematic game, look elsewhere.

Euro style game. Good reviews from dice tower and secret cabal. Area control using a central board to upgrade areas.

RATING: 8.4
Nice, tight army management game where you're training and placing units up a track to prepare for battles against a (sadly bland) Enemy force. Easy to use upgrade tracks for each player, variable races with powers and simple, intuitive rules for scoring. Clever stuff, I only wish the flavor of the 'Enemy' was present in something more than such generic Fight cards, a little more art, naming the encounters, whatever. It's not like the theme overall here is strong beyond a standard fantasy war setup, but the game does take on a dry aspect as a result. That said, the play itself is quite good.

RATING: 6
Solid but unexciting cube pusher/point salad. Theme would be more strongly expressed if there was more pressure to work together and failure to do so had a downside cost. Would play again, but not seek it out.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
I thought the maneuvering aspect within the "War Band" was really interesting.  Also, after I got use to the casualties, I thought that part of combat worked.  Not sure I liked how you can run out of enemy & intel cards.  I think the game works fine, and is fun, but there probably a little more polishing that could of been done to make it great.  I also wasn't a fan of the redress cards, as some of them did feel a bit unbalanced, but this was less of an issue than the other decks running out.  I do however think this game is worth checking out just for the "war band" area control aspect, and I do hope to play this one more.

Not bad, but too long with four players and I wonder a bit at how balanced the various roles are (although with one play I probably need more experience to know for sure). Some interesting decisions to be made.

Unique among Euros with a well-integrated theme. Really like how troops move up the hierarchy. We play with 2 and think it would be more interesting with 4, but most games are that way. Well-designed.

This game offers a very thematic experience that is mechanically sound. Its puzzle is quite interesting, both because of its multiple facets, its tight economy, its multiple ways of scoring points without becoming a point salad, and its possible meanness. Plus, it plays SO quick. Looking forward to more plays to cement my perception.

After a video review: It's an euroish semi-coop game where players build an army to defend against external threat. Players can take various roles in that army build up to follow various path to victory.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This game just made me angry. The longer I played it the more I got angrier and frustrated. I don't like giving really low ratings, particularly due to the touching story on the back page of the rule book but this one is a memory I wish to forget. 

What I did not like:

1. Rules describing how casualties from conflict worked were poorly written. Thankfully, the example given was very thorough and helped us work through that confusing aspect of conflict. (The rest of the game was relatively straightforward but casualties was a bit complicated). 

2. Powers of the races do NOT feel balanced. Part of this plays into which races are in play and may pile on well from another player's ability. My halfling's extra dollar when I taxed was about the weakest power in the game. My opponent's abilities saved them several dollars each turn in promotions or gave them free troops when someone promoted themselves which was a frequent occurrence. Ridiculous.

3. Starting player feels strong out of the gate. They get to attack relatively cheaply if the early players get out a lot of captains. Forces the rest of us later order players to pay more money to fight (and to rub it in, the money gets given to the opponents since they likely have a lot of captains out!).  When one sees the first two players only have to pay $1-2 early to go to war but then have to pay $6-7 when it is one's own first turn AND give that money to the opponents with the head start, my blood was boiling. 

4. The intel cards ran out. Guess when the ran out. They ran out after the first two players in turn order in the final round. Damn turn order. Intel cards can give a ton of points (12) if you can acquire 3-4 of them and place 3-4 scouts but it was pretty much luck of the draw. Sure, you draw 2 and keep 1 but I wasn't lucky in my draws while the two who tied for the win got more. 

Enough - I could probably rage on for a while, as I'm still frustrated with this one several hours later but I think I got some of my frustrations across. :-) I don't know if it is broken, but there is no way I will ever play this game again willingly.

[b]2015-11-07 6[/b] After 1x 4p Play:
Do like the relatively balanced paths to victory and top-notch production quality. The number of actions is just right, not too restrictive, not too loose. The training org chart is quite clear though the battle resolution is a bit iffy. For an area control game, the turn order should be variable to not let last player has too much power on final placement. An ok, but unfortunately not particularly memorable game.

Rec'd by Vasel and Secret Cabal. AP-prone though.

Very confused after a first play. It felt broken and I am rating it very low, but I think we played it "wrong." Not incorrectly, just "wrong." It deserves another play for a proper rating, but it may never get one.

The theme isn't something I'm super into but the gameplay itself was nice. A lot of opportunities for points and always feeling like you have something to do is a plus.

Nicely designed game, a bit of area control, special faction powers and innovative way to do tech advances. The game is short and strategic. Slight randomness in drawing the territory cards (or the cards which allow you to swap with another player).

Interesting game. It has a fighting theme, and it's not a co-op game, but you don't actually fight the other players. It's a euro game with multiple paths to victory.

I wish they could have somehow streamlined and used some different terminology for the Fight action. Overall the game is very simple, but this one action has 9 steps and each player gets a double-sided reference that just explains this one thing. After doing it a few times it starts to make sense, but it seems like it could have been handled better. For instance, there is a part during the fight where you can send cubes to the medic, and there is a separate part where you take casualties. Sending to the medic and taking casualties sound like the same thing but they're handled differently in the game.

There's also a valid criticism that the art and icons on the enemies could have been handled better. The cards all show the same few icons and don't show any actual enemies, so you never really feel like you're fighting. You just feel like you're counting up icons and comparing them. As a euro gamer this isn't really a problem, but nice art would help get more people into the game.

Other than that, the gameplay is pretty smooth and plays pretty quickly. I'll play again when asked, but I won't be grabbing for this because of the minor hiccups.

Okay hybrid style game. Multiple paths to victory. A few fiddly rules but overall easy to learn. Theme is great but not present enough to give the feel of feuding factions. More strategy then I expected. Some serious imbalances with some races.

The box has better artwork than the game which looks rather lack lustre and uninteresting. On the other hand the game plays really well and the board is functional.  Action selection, special powers, choose your upgrade each turn and fight in areas where you hopefully have scouts but more hopefully have few units.  Worth being killed off to get the regress cards. It's quick too.

RATING: N/A
Curious fantasy euro game of up to five races that viciously despise one another yet find themselves working together to save their home world from the coming darkness. But it isn't cooperative. Your race wants to be the best at it. Each race has unique strengths. Improvable player actions, upgradable worker cubes. Fight and defeat darkness enemy cards before they pillage regions. Place scouts for intel. Compete with other races for control of Captains. Force other races to take casualties. Also competing for area control of regions you have have majority of intel cards. A lot to manage. I love the tie breaker for installing a new Captain...the ousted Captain chooses.

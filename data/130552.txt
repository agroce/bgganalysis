Played it some years, had a blast to collect and paint all those wonderful miniatures. The games themselves were not as enjoyable, with so many rule addicts (a lot more than 40K), worse play, and so on. I finally quit the hobby (it's more than just a game, due to time and budget consumption), since the GW selling politics didn't please me anymore.

After not enjoying 6th or 7th Edition this is somewhat better. Broken spells and all.

This edition just didn't do it for me.  Magic is TOO strong, certain monsters are just TOO tough to kill with certain armies.  I want to like this, but I really just can't :(

I can't be bored with this game. 
Even if I forgot about my army for 10 years, I still coming back at this game eventually with the same feeling like the first time.

Love the background, the battle, the painting, the army, the rules. This game will always be in my heart :D

I only got into warhammer at this edition and I love it, more tactical than 40K and lots of theme in the armies. Lizardmen are my favourite because who doesnt love dinosaurs?

I just love this edition of the game. I previously owned 5th edition, and played several games of 6th and 7th editions. This one solves many of previous editions' drawbacks, balancing out how characters work (no more 5th edition crap like HeroHammer), scaling down cavalry so that it must be used strategically again, instead of using it like a mindless steamroller.
The magic system is simple and fun to play. The new miniatures are gorgeous. Save for a few bugs, this game is awesome.

Warhammer really has come on since i started playing on second edition! The complexity has increased but that is probably the attraction....always new items to get , army to improve, make larger, powerful , etc. This game is a lifestyle and not just a game - gets people into painting, modeling, clubs , etc. Brilliant!

I know this game had problems, and no one was buying it, but if there was one game I enjoyed playing above all else it would definitely be WFB.  I have played warhammer since, I believe, 5th edition when I was only 10 or so years old. I haven't touched the game since AoS came out and still do not know how to play that or if I ever will.  If I knew anyone else that was interested in playing the 8th edition rules I would play this as often as possible. I love the point system, creating armies, trying out different armies/strategies, painting the models, the crazy expansive rule book, hell it's complexity. All of that intrigues me, and makes this my favorite game of all time, that sadly is hidden away, on a shelf, in my closet, because it is dead.

Hardcover rules.  A little rules heavy for my taste but still decent fun.  A gift from Todd as well as the movement templates.

Painted partial high Elf Army.

bought the rules and painted some undead figs but I'm not sure I ever played a full game of this!

Tak samo jak WH40k, tylko koszt jeszcze wyższy, gra jeszcze dłuższa. Konieczność malowania przy braku czasu to duża wada.

I played editions 5-8. In the end I realized the designers are not trying to improve the game to make it more enjoyable, but are simply trying to make the most money out of it. I.e. they are trying everything to make people buy more/new models.

Therefor the development of the whole system is based on temporarily overpowering some armies/units to make the kids buy them, just to nerf those armies/units in the next edition and make others overpowered again. And so on ...

From warhammer 6:th edition it went downhill when it comes to balance & this version was imo the weakest one, only played it about of dozen times before moving on to Kings of War which is what warhammer should´ve been.

Some things I like, some things I don't.  The main thing that turns me away is the large number of models now needed.

One of the greatest graphics I have ever seen and at the same time very playable, what is usually not happening in this kind of games. I have played more than 6 times now, yesterday we managed to play twice (once per map) with 4 people. What I like the most in Warriors & Traders is the ability of discussing and 'convincing' each other why you should or should not attack someone, or why you 'should' trade with me using better exchange rate. Even though English is not my mother tongue I did not have any problems. What I like the most are Info Cards. My favorite one so far is Turn Structure card which is helpful in speeding up the game and better follow up on the specific phases. It took me a while to remember all the abilities on different levels, but again - cards are helpful to not get totally lost with this. As many times I played I managed to win only once, but no harm. None of the games I have played so far gave me so many options to plan and rethink my moves (besides chess of course) and try so many new strategies and still - have fun.

Warriors and Traders is an interesting game: it is a mix between an euro (with tech trees, resource management, negotiation) and a wargame (albeit diceless, and very deterministic).
The game has qualities: there is no luck, two beautiful maps, some though decisions, many different ways to score points.
There are also some flaws: the early game feels somewhat scripted (and I wonder if the increasing barbarian strenght won't lead to the same game everytime, with the need to unificate early...), the fixed turn order can hurt some positions more than others (but there's an optional rule for a variable turn order), the tokens are small and not easily readable (why don't use a larger playmat and keep track of the different resources with some indicators?).
Anyway, there's a good game under the surface, even if it probably needs a little polishing to emerge...

This is my first appearance on BGG, convinced by the guys from Warriors and Traders after buying the game... honestly don't know how I could have missed it so far...

I played twice this game, I gotta say it's quite a piece of art. In 3 it is ok, not the best (yeah, my girl who won would not agree). In 4 thou it rocks.

A bit slow to learn in the beginning - high complexity, but with some struggle it was ok. I won my second game. Played trader and did not get attacked by anyone, so my life was easy I would say. It was a bit strange to feel the feed first-get stuff later idea, also the stands are tigght. Did not affect the play signif.

Wanna go to some club and play with some real gamers, anyone around has an invitation in Brussels?

I would say that it reminds me of the old FFG release, Twilight Empire

Anyway, i'm planing to come back here with more info

My scoring is 5 points. Despite the age and the theme the game is a serious disappointment for me because of the geographical mistakes and faults you can find on both the maps. The art is stunning and the maps are beautiful but I think it would have been much better with focusing a little more attention on the historical and topographical details. The game is too expensive for such faults. I like authenticity.

Interesting, but flawed. Warriors & Traders fails mostly due to its large monofocus and the extreme severity of dealing with barbarians. There is little room for deviation and most games will turn out essentially the same.

RATING: 5
After three plays (last one with the new rules) I am not happy with the game: a lot of downtime and if you are attacked at the beginning or have a bad position of you home country on the board you will loose. The player who has success at the beginning will gain more and more power. The others ones develope very slowly. If you play the Trader path you will stay quite weak (compared to the other paths). It is hard to keep a good view over the map (too detailed, crowded).

The thinks I like about the game is - for a civ game - the short time to play and the innovative way the babarians get stronger.

I want to like this game, but I feel like there are a few things seriously wrong with it. 
1. I don't normally say this about a game...but it's too realistic. As a history nerd, I really appreciate that they convey how damned difficult it was for a Dark Ages lord to get shit done. It doesn't necessarily make for a fun gaming experience, however, as the first few turns are really same-y every playthrough.
2. The artwork is gorgeous, but it actually makes the map really hard to look at. Also, the map has an error; Scotland is not connected to the Orkneys, which is a territory it needs to unify. You can ignore it, but it's still confusing your first playthrough.
3. The game ends too damn soon. Part of the fun of building a dark ages state is seeing it succeed, but the game ends right around the time you can finally do stuff or seriously interact with the other players.
4. War isn't very fun in the non-alliance or team play. All too often, you're faced with a situation where you know somebody will get ahead of you and that going to war will stop them but cripple you in the process. Realistic, sure, but it's really easy to fall behind and not catch up, especially as a smaller state.
The only way war is a useful option is if you're a large state who has access to a large supply of weapons in provinces. You simply max out your military counters and nobody else can really stop you.

Civ and conquest game where combat is an option? Yes!
Quick and easy? Yes!
Lovely design? Yes!
It also has a top notch "How To..." PP presentation on a CD in the box to supplement the rulebook.

My first play was fun; I like the "draft" turn cycle (similar to Rise of Empires, but more open ended) and the dice-less combat is simple and efficent. The tech tree is easy to adopt too once you're used to the game terms.

A great new discovery at the start of 2012!

I was a little worried at first. There wasn't a lot of info on the box but it was big and gorgeous. Everything was good quality and pieces were double sided so no necessity to flip them over which is good because there is a LOT of pieces. The game turned out to be easier than expected and a lot of fun but you can tell there is a lot of strategy involved. Look forward to playing some more. A little foggy on some of the rules but overall, very well done.

RATING: N/A
The rules were atrocious! The rule provided a decent overview to the game, but missed explanation of so many details. It was if the rules were written down when someone listened to the designer describe it to his buddies and all the "Oh, and I forgot to say..." was left out. A few examples of the top of my head: Army, is that one counter or a group of counter. Movement, are APs used to move and battle with one, and only one, counter. one and only one group of counters in one area; or does every single counter get that number of APs. Placement, where do new people go; Unification, do you need the contested areas or not; Trading, with the name in the title why is it damn near impossible to do it.

Might be better if someone fixed the mess that is the rules.

As for the warrior portion, you can only really attack two of the six players. So if one of the players on the opposite side of the map is going hog wild there is zero possibility for you to stop him. 

The game should be called "Warriors that don't want to go far from home to attack & You can trade if you try really really really want to do so.

The player aids are on cards and there is only one copy of each. The player mats (tech tree) should have been made larger with that information on each player mat.

The art was nice, but is polish on a turd.

Zero luck other than the initial selection of turn order - the first several turns are a pure solo spreadsheet analysis of the most efficient allocation of the very limited resources available. Player interaction will come towards the end of the game as players start to encroach on each other's territory on the map but you could have saved a lot of time and just started from that point. The rules are very poorly written with a lot of ommissions - another of those instances where game play resides in the mind of the developer rather than in the written rules (being fixed with a net based revision but should have been done properly up front). Quite an expensive game - components are good but not outstanding and there are lots and lots of chits making the admin of the game very fiddly. Perhaps a 9 for the AP gamer, something a lot less for me.

There are a couple of things that I really like about 
Warriors&Traders and would like to share them.

The game requires patience, concentration and attention all the time.

The artwork is beautiful and not only the box, but everything else: map, tokens and cards. It is different from the other games I played which had a nice outside, but nothing special inside.

It tries to recreate a bit the reality of the European Middle Age during which food was scarce, maintaining a large army difficult if not impossible and moving large armies from one place to another a real nightmare caused by the low quality of the roads.

Another thing that I like it the combination between trade, diplomacy and military power. Depending on your personality and/or strategy one can be more important, but you still need the others as well.

Finally I really appreciate the differences between single player mode and team mode. You win together so you should have a common strategy.

In my one play, I felt like I was battling the game's rules much more than the other players. Reminiscent of Eclipse (and fares poorly in the comparison) in that your main goal is expansion, first against neutral forces then the other players, and the trick is balancing income of various resources and the need to produce units and upgrade tech with a limited number of actions, and like Eclipse the game feels more economic/logistic than warrish.

RATING: N/A
Played 4 turns of a demo game. Warriors & Traders is a welcome addition to the genre of multiplayer "empire-building" games with no element of chance. The technology tree is something that is seldom found outside of 4X and traditional civilisation games, so it is nice to find it applied here - albeit in simplified form - to a medieval theme. The game mechanics do not provide anything that gives a specifically medieval feeling to the game, but that would be difficult to do at this relatively moderate level of complexity. One small gripe - the use of modern names for countries and provinces detracts from the 'Dark Ages' theme.

Game that has some fun trading elements and area control, but overall, like many of these games, it gets stuck in the mid-phase where all you want to do is quickly build forts to finish the games.

The technology tree is unbalanced - left column (building) is much stronger.

Overall overview of the game is horrendous - it is incredibly hard to see where you are exactly, how many barbarians there are in the neighboring tiles, and generally the bland board makes it excruciatingly difficult to completely control/check what is going on (esp. For the middle of the map).

Battaglia e commercio, come da titolo, la fanno da padrone in questo gioco dove nulla è lasciato al caso. Materiali curati, dinamiche fluide e avvincenti, battaglie senza lanci di dadi e regolamento non troppo complesso. Il fato la fa da padrone solo nel setup iniziale, l'interazione aumenta con il crescente numero di giocatori e, anche se spesso ci si concentra solo sulle proprie linee del progresso, è indispensabile controllare gli avversari e offendere al momento opportuno. Non mi ha convinte l'ordine di gioco in ogni turno che non si modifica durante la partita. Ottimo prodotto e in offerta troviamo anche l'espansione Italia!

Having seen several uncomplimentary reviews about this game  I was somewhat loathed to buy it even for the cut price of £12 but I did and I must admit I was wrong to have my doubts. The game is brilliant. The rules maybe a little unclear and there are some holes here and there but overall with more that 2 players this game really shines. Definitely play the game with the additional turns variant however - otherwise the game may become a little static as the barbarians become superhuman!

Painful setup and hideous board and components start this game off on the wrong foot. It's got some meaningful strategy to it, but it plods along at such a glacial pace that you don't really care.

his game has a nice theme, the dark middle ages in Europe. I love historical maps in games and in this game the components look really nice.

Unfortunately I was not really impressed by the game play. In order to conquer territories you need to build up an army and maintaining that army is so hard because the needed resource is too scarse. We could have gotten some by trading but the initial trading rate with the bank, like 7 for 1, wouldn't have helped a lot anyway.
Player order was also too important as an earlier player could send hordes of barbarians to your borders.

It is a pity because I think it has the components of a very interesting game. It could be close but now it is not.

I wanted it in Essen, I chose Eclipse over it. My friend and I ordered it online then, ended up paying more than in Essen...

The game playes very well in 3 players or more, I am still impressed there is no luck, I like it almost as much as Eclipse.

Rating after 6 plays, I though of 9/10 but for the graphics and rules, i gave it ... well, not 10, it's not perfect or as good as Eclipse.

If it's the first game as I see, keep up the good work! And lower the price and find an Italian distributor!

RATING: 6
Interesting zero-luck wargame/euro hybrid with team play.

The biggest problem relates to action scarcity and its consequences. At the bottom of the tech tree, players get only two actions per turn. The key to further advancement is unification -- controlling all of the provinces in your starting country allows a one-off unification granting from two to [i]nine[/i] additional actions. This is more or less the only way to progress to the higher levels of the tech tree and thus represents a staggering advantage. Compounding the issue is that the increasing strength of barbarians strongly encourages early expansion (princesses serve no other purpose) and preferably early unification -- this very strongly scripts development in the early game.

The mid-to-late game is where things get interesting. The extreme benefits of specialization (notably on the trade and warrior tracks) makes teams substantially more efficient than free-for-all players -- e.g., scarcity of food and gold relative to other resources forces progress on the trade track, so the ideal alliance includes one warrior as muscle, one trader to provide food and gold, and one producer to feed in vast quantities of raw materials. There is genuine scope for different strategies here, and war becomes a real option.

Alas, some design decisions, such as the deterministic combat and the ability to trade only early in a turn, create an environment perfect for analysis paralysis. Early plays are also difficult because anyone who doesn't follow the expansion script correctly is going to end up a runaway loser. I can see it improving my leaps and bounds with more experience, but at the same time, the lack of variability makes me disinclined to try and get that experience.

I suspect that expert players could get a lot of mileage out of this one, but it's not worth keeping to play occasionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One 3 player game, so far. I thought this was excellent. The tightness of the limited number of actions and the management of resources within a framework of turns and phases flowed well.

The mechanism for the technology tree works very well. You can swap and change to pursue long term strategies, whilst retaining tactical flexibility for short term tech growth.

The rules are light enough that even our first game you felt that you were playing the game rather than the rules.

The game lasts 10 turns maximum and much like another favorite of mine, Agricola, the turns just seem to race by, just has you are starting to unify your country and start racking victory points, you suddenly realise it's the end of turn 8 and you've only got 2 to go.

The components are superb, the map does have one or two anomalies that needed a trip to this site to find the answer for. Although aesthetically it adds to the overall theme and period.

I felt it resembled in some ways a computer game called Europa Universalis. The map graphics and the way it dealt with technology, resources and native barbarians. The computer game is one of my all time greats, so it's a good comparison and why I rate the game an 8/10.

Extremly deterministic and in turn AP prone. Players can easily get stuck due to an opponent achieving unification and then rush boost their tech tree. End play also seems pretty anticlimactic. I strongly suggest three teams a two players to control similar developments. 

Not my cup.

Well designed game. Seemed to me like a simplified and shorter version of Twilight Imperium (you colonize, develop tech trees and fight).
The graphical design is nice but not functional enough for me. I felt it difficult to capture what was going on on the board.

A very easy to learn strategy game, with a very good longevity.

You can play and win with trader, with the warrior and even with the builder.

The map is fantastic, accurate, and full of interesting details. It is double sided, so you can play on both sides with different locations (Eastern OR Western Europe).

Many many many components.

A complaint? I have none. 

Great job guys!

Great game.  A wonderful combination of no luck and high confrontation.  This is one of those rare games that blends ameritrash dudes on a map with euro production maximization for a perfect blend, reminiscent of [gameid=3931] and [gameid=20551].  What's more, the theme comes out quite strongly, both through the beautifully evocative map and through the mechanics of maintaining a dark age kingdom.  Very, very impressive.

Make sure you play with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/76372/english-rule-book-v-2-1-updated-feb-2012]the updated official rules[/url] that strengthen the trader and warrior paths and alter the barbarian retreat rules.  They make the game much better balanced and take it to the next level.

Good game that has a lot of paths for victory. Very tight game that always feels like there is too much to do and not enough actions to do them

nice map and top quality components

Second and third plays made me increase my rating. If my group could speed up play a little I could see this game getting a lot more play.

The best thing about Warriors and Traders is that you have very different ways to get the victory points needed to win: the aggresive player can fight, the economical player can trade and the defensive player can build fortresses. Also, compared to other strategy games, the rules are a bit simpler and the playtime is lower, so I can play Warriors & Traders with friends that would not typically play strategy games.

There is a high amount of player interaction and games can be very different depending on players specialisations (one game with 2-3 traders plays completly different compared to a game with only one trader and 2-3 military).

Each country is different because of position, neighbours and resources available and different strategies are better for each country - so a player that enjoys the game can have many different challenges in trying to win at least once with each country.

A game with a few nice ideas but that seems to follow the recent trend of small companies releasing games that haven't had really professional development.  Would have benefited from a lot more play testing.

A no luck (except for country and thus turn order) so it is more euro than wargame. Battles are handled with ease but they are very bloody. Seems like the early rounds are somewhat scripted for each country. The tech tree is good and works but I have no way of knowing if the paths are equal. Declaring war on another player is tough. As long as you are not first player, if you do it on your 1st action you will get one more before your opponent. Then he will get 2 more before you get 2 more. Seems like a death spiral for bot of you.

After the 3rd edition rules made foot and armor move as one, amoung other issues cleaned up, I'll bump this to a solid 7. Great fun this series

Wonderful counters, especially the Kiwis. The ugly, barren maps kill the gameplay. Attackers can't move and fire at the same time, so they get shredded as they try to move in for close combat. All the scenarios feel the same because of it. Perhaps that is just life in the desert...

The PzG series engenders some highly polarized comments from gamers -- at least in my travels.  I'll throw my rating on the "uninspired" end of the bell curve.

The "Fire or Move" armored combat, combined with turns that represent 15 minutes of combat make AFV battles feel like counterbattery fire on treads.  Also found armored combat painfully non-lethal -- ninety minutes of an armored exchange with little or no effect?

Plus, map depictions of elevation conjure up thoughts of a Red Bull spill rather than hilly terrain. 

Sold it back to my FLGS for credit.

For someone who hates this series of games, I seem to have bought a number of them!  This entry seemed marginally less tedious than a number of the others;  I like the "industrial carpeting" style map, and the counters are, as always, great.

RATING: 7
Beautiful bits.  Series rules a bit too simple, which leaves gaps and casues confusion.  The nice thing about this module is the lack of terrain, which is PG's biggest problem.

My second favorite of the Panzer Grenedier Series.  I especially like the sandy terrain and no mountains, when tanks are involved.  Like the other games in this series, the Leaders will make or break you.  The higher the rank, the better the leader, and you will need good leaders if you expect to win the game.  Oh, lots of tanks will help too.

I really wanted to like this game system.  Great counters, a neat sounding, relatively easy set of rules, and tons of scenarios.  Instead, the game feels more like 'work' than play.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind detailed, challenging games, but the fitful nature of small groups of units moving/firing, and then the other side moving a small group, and then back, made it feel less like an operation than it should have.

Acquired Jan 2009 - Good standard PG fare.  Only two maps but lots of counters (4 sheets of units).  British, Maori, Italians, Germans, Indians.  Will need to play more to get a better idea on scenarios as first few are quite basic.  Others look quite good though.

I have several games of the Panzer Grenadier Series. While they are excellent for solitaire play I don't play them any more because of the counter stacks. Again and again collapsing stacks like the World Trade Center towers with 10 and more counters. And always scanning through stacks. This is not my thing. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Replayability/Fun: 1 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

As with other titles in the series it is much better with the 3rd edition rules and the maps are still a sticking point for me.

RATING: N/A
A box with thin counters, paper maps with big creases, no dice included, and a confusing rulebook. Welcome to the world of cheaply produced yet overpriced war games, I guess. Picked it up on clearance for 75% off at least. Played solo a few times. Still a little confused as to what's going on, but I'm starting to understand how these games work. Maybe one day I can also find someone else with enough of an attention span to put up with this thing.

RATING: 9
It has British, New Zealand, Indian, Gurkhas, German, Italian, Italian Colonial troops. The scenarios selection looks great and there are a lot of shorter ones, it will be hard to decide which scenario to play first. I always liked this time period, which includes Operation Crusader, lots of movement. I checked out Scenario #46, Ariete Attacked. It looked better then Bir el Gubi. There must be about 65-70 armor units in that scenario with the highest eliminated steps being the victor. I’ll break my rule of only playing 50 turn or shorter scenarios to play that one, which is 60 turns. The counters are excellent as usual. There are a few counters that I could not find used in any of the scenarios. The Italian M26, Semovente 90/53 and the British Bishop, they are for those do it yourself or hypothetical scenarios. That is cool for me, someday I’ll switch them out in a scenario and see what could of happened. The designer notes at the end of the scenario book are a nice finishing touch. But again, this looks like a very good product in the Panzer Grenadier Series and I very happy to have purchased it.

RATING: 3
Bland, boring, ahistorical, exploitative in the usual Avalanche way, in its use of a very narrow slice of the forces in the theatre so you have to buy more modules, and also with the standard avalanche of crap scenarios.  Several opponents developed permanent antipathy to PzG within a scenario or two.   John Mundie's analysis bears repeating.

"Now with 15 minute turns and putting the units 400 meters (2 hexes) away from each other in clear and flat desert, its would take the IIIf, on average, 1.5 hours to destroy the Crusaders (with armour efficiency.) The Crusaders would take an unbelievable 6 hours to destroy the IIIf."

Aside from the clunky, overcooked morale rules this is an easy to learn and play system. Desert Rats looks okay - so-so maps and the usual nice counters, but the game is just plain dull.  Tried to like it, wanted to like it, but as it is this game is pretty dreadful.

RATING: 6
Very much ASL-superlite, with an impulse system, rather than IGO-UGO. Counters are very good, lots of scenarios, maps are plain, but well done (it is the desert after all). The overall play is simpler than the rules at first appear, but not as enjoyable as more complex tactical games (yes, I know ATS, ASL,and LnL aren't the same scale). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game has to be broken. Desert battles where tanks and AT guns duel away, and accomplish next to nothing? Yep, that has got to be right.

Do the math. Just look at the counter values and the combat charts. Take a Panzer IIIf versus a Crusader I. First of all, the IIIf has a 16.6% of killing one of two steps with one roll, this being 100% better (???) than the Crusader's 8.3% chance of killing one step.

Now with 15 minute turns and putting the units 400 meters (2 hexes) away from each other in clear and flat desert, its would take the IIIf, on average, 1.5 hours to destroy the Crusaders (with armour efficiency.) The Crusaders would take an unbelievable 6 hours to destroy the IIIf.

That makes perfect sense. Suffice to say, no other tactical or grand tactical game I know of produces these results (in ASL those tanks would be gone in minutes, with a little bit of luck.)

This game is broken.

(You know, this makes me wonder why there isn't some desert combat effect [a special rule of some sort] that could be easily applied to correct this and make the game more reasonable ... wait, this is Avalanche Press. Oh, yeah.)

I love it! From the curious Italian colonial forces (lovingly depicted - and just part of a general pro-Italian element in these games, whatever some say) to the buckets of armoured vehicles, Ghurkas and Maoris etc etc etc. Playable and insightful and wonderful.

WWII Tactical combat at the platoon level. PanzerBlitz for the 21st century. Great looking graphics on colorful oversize counters depicting the troops, tanks, artillery, and aircraft in the fight. Beautifully rendered terrain maps - most games have a set of geomorphic maps, some have full size map sheets. The rules go PB one or two better; overall they are simpler - it's a different kind of combat system - and it adds leaders and morale factors absent in the older game. Tons of scenarios in every game - this game focusing on the later war in North Africa.

Good quality counters and some very good scenarios amongst the 50 included. Maps are bland but of course functional (can desert have exciting maps?). Useful addition to the series.

Bought on sale as they prepare to retire it.  Great game with tons of counters, and by adding the half-sheet from South Africas War, I needed to put 2 counter trays in the box to hold everything.  Great scenarios, very promising play potential.

I enjoy the desert games a lot - wide open spaces and low unit density with lots of tanks works really well in this system.

It's nice to see the British using armour with a snowball's chance in hell of hitting German tanks, and the Maoris are a fun bunch to use

The game is fun, and has a high replayability (lots of scenarios and different armies).Rules are simple yet the game manages to get the flavour of desert combats.Unit artwork is excellent, although maps could be better IMHO.

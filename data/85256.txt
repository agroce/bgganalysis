Muy divertido e ideal para jugar en familia. Las ilustraciones de gran calidad al igual que el material de las cartas. No obstante, venían combadas y con fundas no caben bien en los insertos que trae (que están chulísimos y es una pena).

This game more than most offers great learning value, in a fun game. The replayability is good for learning however can create situations where one person can have a strong advantage. There are ways to handicap this so I still would like to play more of this. I still like this better than standard trivia games because you don't have to know the answer exactly, however the more you know the better you can do.

Choose an invention card from the five in front of you and place it in the appropriate place in the apparent timeline in the middle of the table. If you're wrong draw a replacement, if you're right you're down to just four that you need to place.
First to place their last card wins.
After a few games it might be possible to remember details of particular cards, but to start with at least it's going to be an element of deduction to determine where cards should be placed.

A very interesting game, but I can tell it could be a bit short-lived, not due to players actually memorizing all the dates, but to the cool innovative feeling of it wearing out fast.

A good, fun, filler trivia game. Hurdles effortlessly over most of the usual problems with trivia games by not asking you to name specific years from memory, but rather intuit which of an increasingly-narrowing set of date ranges particular events fall into.

Fails miserably at useful-packaging-design, however, with a tin which is not only far too large for the contents but also has an embossed lid and therefore cannot be easily stacked!

Perfect game when waiting for another player. Takes seconds to explain the rules and length can be adapted as wished.
We sometimes continue placing cards even after ending the game, because it's interesting to see all those dates and to compare events with eachother.

Replayability is not so good if you play with people who remember all the dates from previous games.

Borrowed from library. 1 playthrough (all cards). Played with 2 players. Its an interesting game, by which i mean its interesting to find out the date when certain every day items were invented.

Nice little game where you have to put cards with different inventions on the right place in the timeline. When cards get added the timeline gets longer and it becomes more challenging to place the cards in the right spot. When you get it right you are one step closer to losing all of your card which is the objective of the game. When you place the card in the wrong spot you discard it and take a new card. Nice illustrations and good card quality. The game even has some strategical decision when selecting to cards to play. Do you keep the easy cards for later or do you play the difficult ones first when the time windows are larger.

Expansion after expansion, Timeline has switched its focus from core history to a random trivia contest about debatable dates you would ignore anyways, which may or may not be fun depending on how obscure the events on the cards you got are: whatever your attitude towards the series’ new flavor, «Inventions» is undoubtedly one of the best sets in the line, way better than, say, «Discoveries».

Like any other title in the Timeline series, «Inventions» and the events it includes (mostly everyday items whose creative inventors’ names are ignored by the same people who are used to include them in their daily routines) are a fast and moderately fun way to show your friends your ignorance on several subjects: I’m unsure whether it still can be considered a game or an idle pastime, anyhow it’s fun to see your friends struggle with even the most basic historical events or dates and miserably fail.

That is one of the rare moments in today’s barbaric age when you can openly take pride in your (usually scorned) Humanities background and crush your opponents, see them driven before you and hear their womanly lamentations.

A different take on the whole trivia knowledge genre. It's much quicker and also feels less satisfying, but it's pretty funny to see when some inventions were made and you can really be surprised by some of the cards!

I haven't played the different versions to see any subtle differences, but I like the focus on inventions and technology. For now, this is a go-to option for family gaming and a quick and easy filler.

RATING: 7
Very quick filler game that requires a little knowledge. With over 100 cards we were able to play 3 games without going through the deck more than once. Definitely don't think it is one we can play too often though as we both thought repeated plays would lead to learning at least some of the cards each game which could provide an advantage.

I hate small cards for shuffling...

I suppose it works alright for what it seeks out to do...but I just don't enjoy trivia games. This one has a safety valve where the game continues even if no one knows anything. It seems like playing a couple times you'd start to have an unfair advantage on players who haven't.

It's basically a trivia game. But you don't have to know the exact date - a rough estimate can sometimes be enough.

Played a couple times (one of the other sets). Everyone had fun but on the second play, people who had played the first time had a huge advantage over first-time players -- it was too easy to remember the dates (approximate or exact) of the events. That's great from an education perspective, but I wonder about long-term replayability.

RATING: 7
Very simple gameplay that is easily taught. The concept is that you have a few cards that have an event or invention or something like that on both sides but only one side has the date on it (year). A card is flipped over to show the year in front of everyone, say 1914 for the start of World War I, and then you have to place one of your cards either before or after that date depending on when you think your event occurred. If you get it correct, the turn passes to the next person. If you are incorrect, you draw a replacement card. As people get correct answers, the timeline grows and the gaps get smaller and smaller as events are placed closer to each other (maybe someone else plays a card for 1910 and you know your card is around that same period - it can definitely mess you up). First person to place all their cards wins. The game is the same with each Timeline set, they just have different themes. You can also mix them together which is a nice plus. This game could definitely be used in an educational setting, but I still find it enjoyable to play just for fun.

How I never played this before is beyond me. Maybe I just didn't think a little tin of cards about history could be so much fun?

But it is - a very simple concept with a nice amount of tension built in. I do see how this could get a bit old over time (and players could start to memorize the cards), but for the occasional filler this is a great choice. And accommodating a large number of players is a bonus.

Good game to play sporadically with my non-gaming family members and friends.  Proved to be a hit for Christmas 2015 and 2016.  

We play with 6 sets mixed in together (Discoveries, Diversity/General Interest, Historical Events, Inventions, Music & Cinema and British History) and even then you start getting the same cards again fairly quickly.  However, none of us have particularly good memories so it doesn't matter too much!  If you're playing with people who have good memories then I'd recommend mixing at least 2-3 sets together.

RATING: 5
Easy game. You have a hand full of cards with an invention on the front and the date that it was invented on the back. You start with a card in the middle and you try to guess whether the invention in your hand was invented before or after the one on the table. If you're right your card stays on the table. If you are wrong you discard it and draw a new card. It's neat to learn when things were invented...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not all the cards are in fact to do with inventions (they have added in some "bonus" cards), and at least one is verifiably false (they identified the typewriter with a date at least 100 years too early!) Still, on the whole a fun game if you don't take it too seriously.

This game can be really fun, and really frustrating when you realize you aren't quite as knowledgeable of your historical inventions as you think you might be. The upside of this game is that it's a great filler game that helps you learn something new with out realizing you are learning something. It's also a game that almost anyone can play. My only hesitation is that it can very quickly loses it's replayability as you begin to remember the dates of certain ones and it will become less challenging over time. It would also hinder your play against newbies to the game. This might be alleviated with the addition of other Timeline expansions as they are mashable with one another.

It looks like the game play was stolen from Chronology and Harold Johnson is not getting royalties.  Not cool.  I rate all stolen games a "1".

--- EDIT ---
There seems to be a legitimate debate about whether this is a stolen idea, or whether this idea has been in the public domain for eons and cropped up at two different times and places.  I think that's fair.  If someone publishes a public domain idea, they have to be prepared for others to do the same.

So I am giving this game a real rating,and quite high, as I like this version even better than Chronology.

RATING: 8
Players take turns to add one of their invention cards to the timeline - a row of inventions, along with their associated date, in the centre of the board. The played card is then flipped to reveal its date, and if correct its added to the timeline.  If incorrect, it's discarded from the game and replaced with another card from the deck. Object is the first to play all their cards correctly into the timeline.  Brilliantly executed, yet very simple game. Quite subtle too, as you try to get the coarse guesses out there early, while the timeline is more forgiving.  As it lengthens, the gaps get narrower and the game becomes much more difficult.  Designed with expansions in mind, which are a must, but they buck the trend of most expansions and will only improve the game by diluting the card mix to prevent memorization.  Wonderful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very popular with my casual gaming friends, but I'm not as taken with it for some reason. I guess I would like more cards for more replayability. I can see how a large group could go through the whole deck in only a couple of games. After that, you have to rely on players' poor memory to keep it fresh (which may not be that hard in my group). I wonder if a bidding mechanism would add little spice to the game.

Timeline is a quick and easy game to play.  Doesn't require a lot of setup or break down time.  Just deal and place the cards in the proper order on the timeline.  Easy to play, hard to get it right.

It's somewhat challenging and fun in the beginning, but it starts to get easier as time goes on and you start to remember when things were invented.  Some of the challenge is lost after that.

It's okay.  Wouldn't write home about it, but I'll play it once in a while.

This game is really fun to play and the artwork is beautiful. But sadly the cards are tiny and those of us who are short sighted have a bad time playing it. 
Another problem are the back of the cards. They are exactly the same as the front, except for the date. So you have to be really careful when shuffling the deck. It is easy to end up with a lot of cards exposing the date. The backs should have a black border or something quite different from the front side.

This is a pretty simple, educational trivia game of sorts.  The rules could hardly be more straightforward.  Try to be the first one to get rid of all of your cards, each of which depicts an invention, with the side that you're not supposed to look at stating the date the thing was invented.  On your turn, place one of your cards somewhere in a single pre-existing line of cards according to where you think it fits in the timeline: before an invention that came after it, and after an invention that came before it.  If the placement is invalid, you have to take a new card, otherwise your hand size was just decreased by one. It comes with over 100 tiny cards. The box cover may lead one to believe it's more exciting than it is.  The concept is executed just fine, but there's just not that much too it and obviously it's not as replayable as most games.

"Timeline" et toutes ses extensions, c'est d'abord une excellente idée, un succès qui, rétrospectivement, semble évident. C'est tout à fait le genre de jeu dont on se demande lors de la première partie comment il est possible que ça n'ait pas été fait avant, tant l'idée semble couler de source et manquer d'originalité... On est sûrs d'avoir déjà joué un moment ou un autre, sans vrai boîte mais de façon plus artisanale.

C'est là tout le talent de l'auteur, à savoir cristalliser ces idées simplissimes autour d'un jeu qui peut être commercialisé sous son nom. Il y a sans doute aussi un gros travail pour savoir quels évènements insérer, trouver comment rendre la chose simple mais avec quand même un peu de challenge. Tout l'intérêt de la chose est dans la relativité, c'est ce qui le rend plus accessible que les jeux de culture générale trop précis. Ici, on peut jouer en proposant des fourchettes, qui se réduisent petit à petit, mais nul besoin d'être une encyclopédie vivante, il y a une grande part d'intuition qui en explique là aussi le succès. Je suis toujours épaté par ce genre de créations, qui s'installe dans le paysage ludique et qui semble d'une évidence sans pareille. Et en plus, les illustrations sont en général très réussies et apportent une cohérence à la gamme.

Pourquoi une telle note, alors ? Justement parce que, selon moi et malgré toutes les louanges que j'ai pu faire sur la création d'un tel jeu, le résultat me déçoit un peu. Le mécanisme, même s'il est très bien pensé et colle tout à fait à l'idée de reconstituer une chronologie, est presque trop simple et un peu lassant, manque de subtilité (même si je vois mal où on pourrait l'inclue dans un jeu de ce format). La rejouabilité elle-aussi est assez limitée, quelques parties sont suffisantes pour cerner une fourchette d'un évènement, et pour apporter un peu de renouveau les extensions semblent nécessaires. Et puis surtout, en jouant à ce jeu et en dépit de tous les avantages pédagogiques qu'on peut en tirer et le large public que le jeu peut toucher, je ne m'amuse pas vraiment en jouant. On attend son tour (pas trop, ça va), on pose la carte, et puis voilà. Alors que d'autres objets ludiques touchant le même public ont souvent un petit quelque chose qui les rend amusants, à défaut d'une infinie richesse. Là, on se trouve face à ce qui pourrait être un jeu d'ambiance, mais sans réelle ambiance. Autre écueil, jouer avec quelqu'un qui connaît à peu près toutes les réponses de par sa formation ou sa culture générale. Ayant fait des études d'Histoire, je trouve le jeu en général assez facile et ça peut rebuter les autres joueurs.

"Timeline" est donc un jeu dont la présence sur le marché ludique semble évidente et qui mérite amplement son succès, mais qui moi, ne m'a pas convaincu plus que cela, malgré l'admiration que j'ai pour le travail de création d'un tel objet ludique. Ce qui ne m'empêchera pas de le sortir à certaines occasions si le public s'y prête, tant il est fluide, simple à expliquer et à comprendre.

Timeline er en serie af spil, hvor der på engelsk endnu kun er udgivet denne version, Timeline: Inventions, hvor der som titlen angiver er lagt vægt på opdagelser. Hver spiller modtager et antal kort, hvor der på forsiden er afbilledet en opdagelse (eks. kork-proppen, vindmøllen, varmtluftballon etc.) eller i mindre omfang historiske begivenheder, monumenter eller lignende. Det går så ud på, at man i sin tur skal forsøge at slippe af med et af disse kort ved at placere det på en tidslinje på bordet, der dannes af tidligere spillede kort. Når kortet forsøges placeret ind på tidslinjen vendes det om og på bagsiden er der udover de informationer, der var angivet på forsiden, også angivet det år, hvor opdagelsen blev gjort. Er kortet placeret korrekt på tidslinjen bliver det liggende, og man har nu et kort mindre på hånden og da vinderkriteriet er, at man ikke længere har kort på hånden er man således et skridt tættere på sejren. Er kortet ikke placeret korrekt på tidslinjen lægges det bort og man modtager et nyt kort med en anden opdagelse.

I Timeline: Inventions er det ofte muligt at foretage et kvalificeret gæt på hvornår opdagelsen blev gjort. Strukturen i spillet er samtidig så simpel, at det kun fordrer få øjeblikkes introduktion inden man er i gang at spille spillet ligegyldigt om man spiller med nogle der aldrig har spillet noget, der er mere kompliceret end Ludo. Timeline: Inventions er oplagt et spil, vi vil hive frem igen og igen og som vil komme til at ligge i tasken, da det opbevares i en lille metaldåse. Det eneste alvorlige minus jeg kan finde ved spillet er, at nogle mennesker vil være i stand til at huske årstallene på begivenhederne, når de har set dem en enkelt gang. Og for mig er det sjove i denne type spil ikke at teste folks hukommelse men deres evne til at kunne deducere sig frem til nogenlunde hvornår tingene skete. Dette minus sætter desværre en grænse for spillets levetid og smitter også af på min bedømmelse af et spil, jeg ellers har meget sympati til overs for og som vi nok skal få slidt godt på.

A fun little filler game. You are trying to guess when inventions occured in history relative to other inventions. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The one problem I see is that you couldn't really play it frequently because you would learn all the dates and the game would suffer.

I like this game and the idea of this game very much, but it gets a 6 from me because I like it when in trivia games they give little extra information on the back about the event, invention, ect. - even if it is just a short sentence (Wits and Wagers does this pretty well)  It would be especially fitting in this one because the backside is basically empty.  This would aid me in learning (the fun part of trivia games) more so than it does in its current form.  Nonetheless, I still like it a lot as a filler.

Joc de cartes molt sencill, on només es tracta d'ordenar cronològicament una serie de succesos i/o invents. Es juga molt ràpid i, a vegades, depén massa de la sort que tinguis en les cartes que et toquen.
S'ha de jugar amb la baralla de cartes tapada, de forma que no es pugui veure la primera carta, per evitar que els jugadors sapiguen quina sería la carta que els hi tocaría si fallen.
Es crema molt ràpid, ja que si t'aprens o recordes les dates, ja ho tens fet...

it worked surprisingly well when I played this with some friends. None of us was competitive nor knowledgeable about inventions.

Not sure if this is one of the sets I played or not, but this appears to be the earliest entry so I will rate it.  Fun game that was surprisingly difficult, even with a good knowledge of history.  I would like to have one additional layer of interaction (take-that possibly) to prevent the sweep victory but overall I thought it was very pleasant and certainly expect to play again.

I played this game 3 times in one sitting with a few people and I am now hesitant to play again. I feel that I have seen most of the cards and, if not certain about the exact dates, still have a good enough ballpark to know where the cards I saw with pretty reliable accuracy.

It feels that I have to keep adding additions to keep this game fresh.

This is the hard mode of Timeline. Over 100 inventions, most of which happened in a span of 150 years! I added this to Timeline Diversity and I think the combo works well. The game is super easy to learn and teach, there is virtually no setup and you can take it everywhere and play it anywhere.

Timeline is a solid filler game that's quick to learn and fun to play. There are some balance issues (some cards are harder to place than others). There is also some danger in limiting replay value by memorizing the dates of events, using multiple Timeline sets helps alleviate this... and besides, learning the dates is a good thing... it's educational!

The Inventions set is particularly challenging and informative. It will surprise many players exactly when certain everyday object were actually invented. This set is really good for upping the overall difficulty of the game.

A nice party game, extremely simple to teach and fun for everyone. It sidesteps the usual problem of trivia games, which that they are often too easy or too difficult. Since you place your card in the timeline, you can use your intuition or vague memories. 

One big flaw is the very low replayability. There are only a hundred or so cards in a set, and you quickly go through them and learn them. I have no doubt the game would really shine with a much bigger pool of cards, especially of different themes. But each box is pretty costly, and overpriced already, so getting 2-3 of them just as a starter is not very enticing.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (2012 December)

Great trivia game. Easy to teach, scales well, offers loads of fun and it has a short playtime. I really like that Timeline plays so quick so I don´t have issues with the luck factor. This game can be a powerful educational tool.  The art is so well done you don’t need to read the card to know what it depicts, great for players who doesn’t know English (or French as I have this edition).

On the bad side, if you play the game enough times you will encounter the replayability factor begins to go down as it is easy to memorize the dates, so I will buy expansions to compensate for this, but this is a game that cannot be played constantly. Also the initial player has a huge advantage but I try to not let this bug me that much.

Current Rating: 8.0

This game have been a success every time I have played it in a game night. It has a lot more plays in it that I initially thought, it is not as easy to memorize all the dates. However I already bought the Events expansion :D.

As I never read the rules (my copy is in French) it appears the first player has not a big advantage as I thought. I believe all the players have to have the same amount of rounds (I wasn’t playing it like this). Still the first player has an advantage as there are fewer cards on the timeline.

A great game.

As I’m trying to correct/unify all my ratings, I cannot continue to give this an 8.0. I still think this is a good game and I plan to play it a lot it more (now I have all the expansions), however, I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings with BGG recommendation rating system. 

One of 2010 favorites.

RATING: 9
Put the cards depicting various items you have into the right spots on the developing time line based on their year of creation: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears them all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but you will be getting taught by the game as to a bunch of dates you did not know. HARDEST of the sets and still very fun, educational, quick and easy to learn. The only downside is that you'll eventually know the cards and have to mix in other sets.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, fun & educational - with strong involvement by all players!
BIG MINUS: size of the cards

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating before playing. Knowing the nature of the game I can safely say it is not a heavy hitter by any means, rather a fun party game for changing groups (although also a single group can have many plays with it without getting too repetitive).

It WILL get repetitive in the end, given the nature of the gameplay (eventually you will be able to correctly align the given cards, as you learn the years of the inventions), but until then it can provide a fast 15-minute relaxed experience with a bit of a history lesson...

A neat idea for a game that is super easy to teach and fun to play.  The game length feels just about right, though it can run a touch long if it bogs down at the end.  I can see that happening too, since it gets pretty tricky at the end.

I can see that replayability could potentially be a problem, but in all honesty I will not be playing this consistently enough to memorize the cards.  Plus, it looks like there are already a few expansions already released or in the pipeline.

Does a great job of rescuing the most boring pub quiz question - "In what exact year did X happen?" - by turning it into a series of comparisons which can have a bit of reasoning applied if you don't know the answer offhand. Doesn't seem massively replayable, or to work if some players have played before and know the surprising answers, but fine as an occasional quiz.

This barely has any gameplay decisions. It's mostly just straight-up historical date recall. Those were the worst kinds of quizzes in history class (recall without understanding).

Timeline: Inventions is a card game played using 109 cards. Each card depicts an invention on both sides, with the year in which that invention was created on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.

Очень простая и интересная игра на знание истории человечества. Правила можно объяснить за 1 минуту. Средняя партия длиться минут 5-10. Абсолютно лучший филлер, который мне пока попадался. Недостаток - быстро запоминаешь карты, поэтому ждем дополнения. Маленькая коробочка позволяет легко брать игру с собой куда угодно. Еще это отличная развивающая настолка для детей где-то от 7 лет. Рекомендую!

Quickly exposes your ignorance but unlike games such as Trivial Pursuit where the same experience is a long, boring and painful this is fast and in many cases with very surprising results.

To compare it further with Trivial Pursuit which is mostly a game where you watch opponents jump between grey spaces and then see them deliberate for minutes before coming up with a guess of Duran Duran; Timeline Inventions is quick, accessible and each move has meaning to the game.

The only similarity to Trivial Pursuit which is the black hole of games sucking all of the fun in the room into its empty centre is that you are always bound to be certain of your opponents cards but uncertain about your own.

Highly recommended for a game in this genre but it does expose ignorance so some players might react badly and repeated play can make you familiar with some cards.  Therefore, get the game but maybe only play in small doses.

One of the better of its kind for the first games, but not so interesting after that. Still nice from time to time (I have a terrible memory so theorically I can really pley a lot with the same card). 

Easy to play with everyone, from little children (I was really surprise to see that 6 year-olds could have a not so bad idea of chronology) to grandma, but also with expert players, their partner, your collegues or students...

Not really fun for people really good in history and inventions and dates who won't have to guess as much.

Simple game with an event on one side an a date on the other.  You are dealt five cards and players take turns trying to put them in the correct location in the timeline.  It gets harder later in the game as you add to the timeline.  If you make a mistake you take another card.  

Fast, simple filler game that teaches you some dates in history.

An ultra short game best suitable while waiting for some other players.

This is such a simple game, I can't believe no one's thought of it yet. In fact, it's so simple, it almost borders on not being a game IMO. It's literally just a deck full of cards with the dates on one side, and you're supposed to create a "timeline" of the dates. Pretty simple. Takes about 10 (ok, maybe 20) seconds to teach. Great for literally anyone to play. The reason this doesn't get a higher rating is the fact that some of these dates are wrong. In a game that's literally a deck of cards with dates on them, getting the dates right seems to be about the only job you had in creating the game. This game gets much better the more expansions you add in too.

Timeline is a game that can be really fun and accessible for people outside of the gaming hobby. Considering that it can be taught and played in under 15 minutes, it is definitely light. It also requires some outside knowledge in order to be played successfully.

This is a very light game of trying to place key dates within the chronology of an ever growing timeline. 

It is a game but is heavily knowledge based and over-familiarity can reduce the fun to be had and competitive nature of the game.

Production wise the games in the series are just gorgeous to look at and many a collector will buy them for that reason alone. 

This is something very differnet for a person's collection and is also perfect for families and school's as an educational resource.

The series is also great for dinner parties as conversation starters.

Timeline is a great game for those moments where you just want to play a quick game, without having to learn rules. The mechanic is brilliantly simple - stick events on to the timeline. If you're right, great. If not, less great. What I quite like is that when you flip the card to reveal the answer, it gives you the date and the name of the person they're crediting with the invention/event - so geeks like me get their extra reading sorted. It's also quite fun to try and talk through your answers, and some of them really will surprise you. The biggest flaw of the game is replayability. It's not huge; once you've played a few times and learnt the dates, you get better and better. It does take a while for this to happen though. This is why there are so many variations of the game (Sports, Inventions, Discoveries, Star Wars... etc.). Add two points to the rating if you're a history buff.

Harder than expected but in a good way. Customizable with the different focus means that it can be tuned to your groups' knowledge and even within one pack there are a variety of types of ways to know where a card goes. Decent re-playability when you have more than one deck.

If you are looking for a quick warm up game, this probably isn't it (try Love Letter) but as a fun break in game night this is a fine change of pace.

This rating stands for all the Timeline games unless that changes with some radical new mechanics. I like this game a lot. It seems like a great intro/filler/light/casual game for non gamers (still enjoyable by all) and educational and good for families too. The educational factor for adults and children should not be underrated. Also, this is far and above better than other trivia games because there's room for logic, speculation and clever thinking, it's not MERELY that you either know it or you don't (though this is still a part of it being a trivia game ultimately)

The game consists of approximately 100 cards, each with a well drawn picture (and name) of an invention. The back of the card is the same, plus the date the item was invented. Players have four cards each. Two more are face up on the table. Without looking at the back of their cards, players in turn have to add one of their cards to the "timeline" on the table. Correct placements stay (making it harder for the players that follow), while incorrect guesses are discarded and the player draws a replacement. First to get four right (and run out of cards) wins. Very simple, and quite engrossing (probably because there were lots of know-it-alls at the table).

The cards are very nicely illustrated, and there are several "expansions" (famous people, events etc).

I enjoyed Timeline quite a bit, although it probably has limited replay value; eventually people will learn the cards.

The only problem is that the cards don't fit in the box if you sleeve them, so you have to take off the insert.

規則:
*牌日期面朝下洗勻成為牌庫，照人數發予對應張數的牌並置於桌面上
2-3名玩家：6張 / 4-5名玩家：5張 / 6-8名玩家：4張(有經驗的玩家亦可自訂張數)
*從牌庫抽1張牌，將日期面朝上置於桌面中央成為起始卡，年紀最小的玩家成為起始玩家
*遊戲輪流行動，輪你時必須將面前持有的1張牌，放置到已揭露牌的時間線中，當決定好位置後，將卡片翻至有日期的那面，確認位置是否吻合
>若位置吻合就換人。
>若無法吻合，棄掉該卡，該玩家從牌庫補1張牌置於面前
*若年代相同則無論是置於左右側皆正確
*當牌庫耗盡時，該局遊戲不分勝負，並重開新局，否則當該輪僅有一名玩家將持有的牌出完時，該玩家即為獲勝玩家，若該輪有2名以上玩家將持有的牌出完時，則未出完的玩家們立刻淘汰，出完牌的玩家們補1張牌，遊戲持續進行直到僅有一名玩家勝出為止

Same rating/comment as the other Timeline decks. Basically the same game as Chronology, except that you have a common timeline rather than each player having a timeline. It's a simple and enjoyable mechanic. Choose one of your cards and place it in the right spot in timeline order (from earliest to latest) amidst the previously placed cards. Fail and you draw another. First one to get rid of their cards wins. It can only really be played with people of the same age and background to be enjoyed by all, but it comes in at the right length, and can be an nice way to pass the time with friends. A bit educational as well, providing a bonus.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Can be taught in about 20 seconds
- Plays quickly (10 minutes with 2-3p)
- Educational, in a fun way
- Small box

What I don't like:
- More education gives you a pretty strong advantage
- Seems like it could go quite long with 5p.
- High randomness, but that's fine in a short filler like this
- You will start to memorize dates, so after 5-10 games within a short time, it will lose replayability

I really enjoy this, but I'm afraid it might not work well when different players have different levels of historical knowledge. I can see it being quite frustrating for some people.

Very basic game of trying to guess where chronologically in the current string of played events does one of you events fit. If you are right, you place it in the spot and it adds to the difficulty for others, if you are wrong, you discard and take another card. Cute, but there isn't really much of a game here.

This simple card game asks players to date important inventions in history by placing the card for that event between other events people have played. As play progresses, the board builds up, and you have to be more specific with your date range guesses. It's a fun concept, but I have to wonder about replayability as eventually players will start to remember the dates.

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per play

This is an educational game that is tough on the brain! They have a lot of things right next to each other and it is hard to get rid of the last card or two, but it is fun never the less. I can see this game last for 6 sessions, which meets the $1 per game goal for me. Got this on a deal from Amazon Xmas 2013.

---- Update ----
Played this game with 5 players and the game slows down tremendously and almost out-stayed its welcome. Recommended for 2-4 players.

---- Update ----
Played with my house-rule to reduce 1 card per player compared to the official rule. This made the game easier to finish and not drag out its welcome.

I was hoping this game had a cool introductory plot text with the story of that girl on the tin, but it was just rules. This game didn't work for my group because we had trouble with the difference between the date things were discovered and the date things were invented and the date things were published, all of which are mashed into this game willy nilly, sort of forcing you to be wrong even when you and wikipedia know you are right.

Simple yet elegant trivia game. Select a card from your hand and place it relative to a timeline of inventions. Correct placement adds to the timeline, incorrect it is discarded and you need to draw a new card. 
First one to play all their cards wins. 
As the game progresses the timeline gets more dense and you must be more exact in placing in your year estimate. The subtle strategy is to play the cards you are less certain about when the timeline is more forgiving. To keep the game fresh it will need expansions to have fresh cards in the deck.

Over and under produced version of [gameid=13223].

Overproduced because each card is individually and lavishly illustrated.

Underproduced because the game comes with only 109 cards. You're eventually expected to purchase the 6+ expansions (which fortunately can be played individually) for $20 each.

Bonus points for having the dates on the opposite side of the invention in question on each card.

Good with 2-6.  Anymore than that and the timeline gets so granular that only a "wiz" can win and the rest of the people will just clutter things.

This is a good filler game to play for 10-15 minutes while everyone settles at the table for a bigger game.

The only problem I've seen is that people who've played before may have an advantage because they'll remember approximate (or exact) dates.  I haven't run into this yet...but it's coming.

Basically a test of knowledge, although there is some very minor "strategy" (play the ones you're least certain about first, before the board gets more clogged up and things get harder to place). This is really not at all interesting in terms of game mechanics, and clearly you can't play any one Timeline set particularly often - yet it's actually quite entertaining as a once-every-few-weeks filler. (And that's actually a lot more often than we pay most of our heavy strategy games.)

In my opinion, this game is a great way to learn a little of History, especially to remember those YEARS which are very difficult to memorize. I confess I was a little disappointed when I saw its cards size (VERY small), since it´s difficult to appreciate the quality of its illustrations. However, once you start playing, you realize that they´ve the appropriate size, avoiding to ocupy too much space on the table. It´s a portable game, and very easy to take anywhere. Its rules are veeery easy and plays are fun, quick, and short. My main concern is about its replay value, because once you learn the YEARS you´ll win almost all the play but... What the hell!! You learn history!! That´s great!!!!

Basically the same as Anno Domini, with the same limited topic in a set. This one has only one third of the cards though, albeit prettier cards. To make a decent game of it you need to mix the other topics of Timeline into the one game - which makes it a pricey game - or buy the 220 card mixed version.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Certainly the topic specific deck drags the rating down on this one as a stand alone game.

RATING: 7
This game really is great. It is simple to learn, very easy to teach and fun to play. the best thing about it is how easy it is to get people to play it. On Christmas Day, I had my 60 year old mother-in-law and her 84 year old parents playing it...and having a blast. They never want to play games. You can have a house full of people and not be able to find anyone to play Ticket to Ride or Pandemic, nevermind Through the Ages. If you sit down and start playing this game by yourself, you will have people coming over to play with you in no time! That is a great game attribute.

The bad. Replayability. I have played 15 games now, and I really can't play anymore. There are only 109 cards, or something close to that. When you get the ones that really shock you, the tricky ones, you will tend not to forget them. This will give you a huge advantage. Even if you don't remember the year, you will probably remember the decade.

Bottom line, it is a very fun game that is easy to learn. It is a true appetizer. it is like a gateway to gateway games and that is awesome! Unfortunately, it would have been nice if there were a thousand cards or if all six sets had been released at once. Still, I haven't played it with one person who didn't like it and want to play it again. Several people I played with ordered their own copies! If it had 5000 cards, I would give it a 9.

Una idea tan tonta y simple como efectiva, Timeline es un juego que se tarda 30 segundos en explicar y montar y 10 minutos en jugar. Se puede jugar con cualquier persona y tiene variedad de temas.

Como pegas, se puede alargar un poco si somos un poco zoquetes y cada caja tiene rejugabilidad finita, porque al final van sonando las fechas.

Tricky, tricky. 

Fun party game BUT low replayablity. 

This is one for those like me who can spend hours on wikipedia. The whole idea of the game is trying to organize the dates of various inventions in order - you start with cards you need to get rid of, but you don't know the dates (these are hidden on the back of the cards). So you play them in the middle row with revealed dates. That's it. Unfortunately this would use many more cards to have replayability beyond the first evening. Something in Time's up category would be needed. 

Problem: I have a very good short memory. Fourth game of this (in a row) when we had to re-shufle the deck for the first time, I remembered a lot of these dates allready. After 10 games I wouldn't have anything to play anymore. Now similar game Anno Domini (german) has no illustrations but comes with 250% the cards this one has and has more expansions. And I would say that while illustrations are neat, they are not really needed, more cards however is. 

Rating - first game = 7
For occasional gaming with couple of months hiatus - 5.5
Great idea, but until there's a box with 1000+ cards, don't bother.

A fun little group game. Place your cards inbetween other cards based on the time you believe the invention was well... invented. 

First to run out of cards wins. The only problem is that after a while you remember the years and that gives you a distinct advantage. 

Still, a fun game with 4 or more people.

Great "trivia" game. Very simple, but still playable even if you don't know the exact dates because you can try to figure out when things happen relative to each other. In fact, that's a big part of the fun, and then revealing to see how accurate you were.

Thought this was going to be too simple at first glance but I am really enjoying it so far.

Probably about what you expect, if you do not know dates, not going to work out well for you. The rules are very simple, but this causes some problems, the game will start with just one event on the board, so the first player just has to know before or after that one date for one of their events, so less dependent on date knowledge than you might think, but after a few turns you start having to get closer, so you can win without knowing any dates, but you do have to get within a few years ...

RATING: 7.5
We played this at a pub in the evening. It is a very clever game. I'm not a person with good memory, so I don't know years of inventions. But I can guess where probably that one comes. And you can be surprised by some inventions. I loved it the first time I played it, it was interesting, there were lots of facts that could surprise or were very very interesting to find out. Sadly if you play it a lot, there is not much replayability, you start to remember stuff. It's a great teaching tool though and for playing it from time to time a great thing to do. When you have to "guess" where that invention in the timeline goes? That's a feeling like nothing else. A good idea for a game. Like it.

All of the Timeline series have the same premise:
Play the cards to the table so that the card you're playing fits in chronological order. If you can do that then the card remains in play. If not then it's discarded and you draw a new card.
The downside to this set is that inventions are usually harder to pin down to a date than historical events are, so the expansion tends to be more difficult than others.
The game makes an excellent learning tool for children.

Good theme, and great concept, but not much of a game. Lay a card down, check it, if you are right play continues. Otherwise pick up a card to replace your wrong answer. When you play with people who know inventions, it can be over in as many turns as there are starting cards in your hand. Could be fun in the right group, but heavily group dependent. Not to mention the fact that once you have played at least one game, you have memorized all of the years making this an even simpler game. I just wish there was more game here.. Fortunately I picked it up at a garage sale for a quarter and was able to trade it away. Hard pass.

Timeline is more of a trivia challenge than a game. After the first plays it degenerated into a contest to see if my daughter or I could memorize the deck first. At which point the game ceased to be fun. It is a neat way to sneak in some education.

RATING: 5
[thing=85256][/thing] is as simple as a game can get. First you put a card in the table, with the side with the date up. After this, the players receive a hand of cards (6, for two players, for instance) and each player, in turn, must put a card in the row, either in the left (before) or in the right (after), in comparison with the cards already in the row. So, let's say the first card put in the table is the invention of the printing press (1450), and the first player want to use the card of the invention of the telephone. He puts this card on the right (after) of the printing press card, then reveals the date on the back of the card, which reads "1860", so he is right, the invention of the telephone happened after the invention of the printing press. The turn passes to the next player. When the player is wrong, he discards the card used from the row and take another from the deck. The winner will be the first player without cards in the hand (but everyone must have the same amount of turns, so, if one or more players empty their hands in the same round, these players will, each in turn, take one card from the draw deck and try to put it in the correct spot - this will go until someone makes a mistake).

Of course, in the early game, things will be easy, since you can choose which card to add to the row, and the guesses can be quite wide in range (you might don't know if something was discovered in 1400 or 1500, but you are sure as hell that if was before 1900). But once the number of cards in the row rises, so does the difficulty - because now you know that something was discovered in 1800, but it was after 1855? And if it was, it was before 1878? So things get a good deal tougher and, because of this, it is also more fun.

The problem with the game you might have already guessed: once you have played it some times (and this can happen fast, since the games last around 10-15 minutes), and you (or others) have a good memory, you will get much greater grasp of the years things have occurred, and this will also translate in you having a major advantage over people playing for the first time (unless, you know, they are history geeks). Therefore you will have to add more cards, and the game already have several, in similar topics: discoveries, historical events, music & cinema.

Anyway, is a super light game, that plays fast, you can teach easily for anyone, and is also a fun way to learn something.

I liked it, but really won't crave for more plays.

Play one of your invention cards into what you think is its proper place in a growing timeline and then flip it over to see if you were right.  Were you?  Then leave it there.  If you weren't, you discard it and draw another card.  Play until at least one player runs out of cards.  It doesn't sound like much, and folks with a good history background have an advantage, while its replayability will be affected by how good your memory is over time, but it's actually a neat little game with a nice narrative and some tactics to use over the course of the game.  You might even learn something as you play!  I do recommend drawing off of the bottom of the stack, though, so you don't get to see what your next card is going to be.

History in a box! There was a lot of discussion with this one, and we often ended up helping each other to place cards.  I enjoyed this one a lot, but I'm not sure how much replayability it will have in the long run.

I'd like to try playing with the [thing=3137]Anno Domini[/thing] rules, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I play with the rules from 
"Anno Domini: Lifestyle" :

At the start of the game every player receives 9 cards with the event side up.
During the game the players add card after card to a growing row of cards while trying to maintain a correct chronological ordering. Instead of adding a card a player can challenge the last player. If this happens all the cards in the row on the table are turned date side up. If the cards are ordered correctly the challenger must take two new cards as penalty. Otherwise the player that placed the last card receives three additional cards.
The aim of the game is to be the first player who adds their last card to the row of cards on the table giving a correct chronological ordering.

Best filler game out there. Mechanics so simple takes 20 seconds to explain. A game takes about 5 mins.

If it was just trivia it would be boring but since you only need to take an educated guess as to if say the toothbrush was invented before or after the steam engine its lots of fun.

Only thing that can be said about this game is you need to either play one of the other versions or take a break between too many games as you start to learn the dates on the cards

I love this "simple" games, very easy to learn, very short, with "emotion". I would like to play some of the variants.

There's like a dozen of these, and my crew tends to mix sets, so I'll track most plays as being the base game, unless it's a solo set.

Timeline is a good...time! Easy to play, and doesn't look like a "board game" to scare your friends away with. Doubles as school work! Yuck, learning!

Timeline in a game works pretty well. Good filler, and easy to combine with other editions.

Un juego que gustará a todo el mundo, que funciona tanto a 2 como a 8 jugadores. Se trata de adivinar qué inventos fueron antes o después de los que ya hay en la línea de tiempo. A pesar de lo que pueda parecer es muy rejugable, puesto que existen multitud de inventos en el siglo XIX y resulta difícil precisar el año exacto.

This is a very light cardgame, but it is fun. We played the Inventions edition (which is the 1st one that’s published in this series). The artwork on the cards is very nice done. The most fun in this game, is the fact that your amazed from time to time. “Is this that old?” or the other way around “Is this invented only a couple of decades ago?”. People could say that the cards could be memorized. That’s true, but why should you. If you’re really interested in how old something is, you would have paid attention in school, and you could place most of the cards in the right order. No, just kidding. The fact that the cards are memorable is true, but we played this one a couple of time after eachother, and none of the players (5p-game) could remember the exact year that was on the card. This is just a very nice filler game.

Guess where an invention fits in the timeline of previously played invention cards.  Gets more and more difficult as the timeline gets more crowded.

Ingeniously simple game design.  But it's probably only good for a few plays before you start to memorize the cards.

Quick filler with an educational bent as well as some deduction.  (The pictures of the items often give you a clue as to when they were invented.)  Surprising re-playability given the limited number of cards.  Worth the price and probably good for children.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play.
A fun little adventure game.  Complexity is a bit of a challenge for non-gamers.
The end seemed like an anti-climax, but probably wasn't helped by us taking a huge meal break 2/3rds the way through the game.

RATING: 8
very fun game with aspects of RPG, co-op, dungeon-crawl, and economics.  The van Took character in the base game is probably imbalanced, but can be house-ruled.  The build up of player's equipment versus the strengthening of the monster creates nice tension, as does the ability of other players to intervene in the monster battle.

RATING: 6
The production quality is far superior to the quality of the actual game. I love the board & the minis, the art, everything really (the cd is awesome) it's totally packed with flavor & theme. I really should just develop rules I actually enjoy.

RATING: 4
This game is around the same fun level as Talisman and shares more than a few of the mechanics. But it lacks the charm of old school games. Basically, you move about the board at the whim of a single die roll, collect things that beef you up, and then roll dice for combat (without any nonsense about how and what to attack with) until you're beefy enough to beat the bad guy. For me, it's just meh and I'm not likely to willingly play it again unless I'm completely out voted.

Fun game, Arkham Lite (but in a good way!). Can easily play this within two hours as opposed to the 3-5 required for AH.

RATING: 5
I can't get over how ugly Nosferatu looks on the box, I like flying frog and this has a solid theme but you do find yourself roaming in the different locations with no purpose (thoroughly distracted by the beautiful and haunting map), you end up forgetting what you are trying to achieve at times and in the beginning you literally have no clue what to do. The story reveals itself slowly and it is a lot like reading a book rather than playing a game. It might appeal to some.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed this more than I thought I would. A fairly fast pace and no evil player make this go smoothly and interestingly (more than LNoE which I didn't like at all). I particularly like the "secrets" mechanic which adds a lot of flavour.
Still quite random but thematic and fun anyway!!

a much lighter version of arkham horror in my opinion. good for gamers not wanting to play games 4 hours or longer (AH can take that long if you don't make good decisions). not bad but not as good as AH.

RATING: 7
It's going to draw the inevitable comparison to [thing=15987][/thing], and I'm in the minority, but I like this one more.  For me, it has the perfect mixture of simplicity in play, learning curve, and difficulty to win, and length of play.  

I also like how instead of trying to keep the big boss from appearing, you have to confront and defeat him (meaning he's tough, but not over-the-top touch like AH), and if you get bad dice in the fight, the game is not over, because you can get another shot at him.
 
I played it with the [thing=42047]Something Wicked expansion[/thing].

A great game that gets better with expansions. Ejoyable theme, great components. Plays competitively and cooperatively. Really enjoy this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A shorter, lighter (mostly in terms of game complexity), more streamlined Arkham Horror.  All (or almost all) of the punch but in a shorter timeframe and with a bit less clutter.

Options for gameplay include: basic or advanced; individuals or teams or group (for coop), cooperative or competitive.  Plays up to 8, but recommended with 4-6 or so, with 4 probably being the sweet spot.

So far I've played basic-individual-competitive and advanced-group-cooperative.  Definitely enjoyed the a-g-coop more than the b-i-comp.

The i-comp felt too fickle and uncontrolled.  I'm not a huge fan of high levels of screwage, and the i-comp just didn't feel like it had many counters or more options.  The other players blew their screwage cards on me, meaning the next person in line walked away with it.  Just didn't feel very balanced around an individual-competitive mode.

But the coop, oh the coop.  Felt very tight, could be tough.  Good choices to make and plenty of fights to be fought.  Strongly recommend coop or teams.

The enemies are well done.  The game is *very* thematic.  The production quality is excellent.  Well worth checking out.

Additional Comments (6/26/09):  Teaching this game is tricky.  There's a lot to it and it's real easy for people's eyes to glaze over.  I think I recommend hitting the big points (game turn, movement, combat, actions, tests, items, enemy's abilities) and handling (in detail) a lot (all?) of the smaller, more nuanced ones (mystery phase & mystery cards, minion chart) as they come up.  Not sure if that will work, though, since some of the smaller points can be very important/key.

It's a very good idea to check out the rules questions, FAQs and errata (as one might do for Arkham Horror).  The rulebook is [i]mostly[/i] complete, but leaves a good number of unanswered questions.  (E.g., For what-ifs and rare scenarios.)  I'm contemplating putting together my own "complete" FAQ as I really don't see one yet.  (Which is kind of surprising.)  I expect this to get worse with the release of further supplements and expansions.

More comments (6/29/09):  I played a few (4) solo player games.  Werewolf is a problem since becoming a werewolf does nothing.  Otherwise solo play seems to work.  The difficulty is a bit weird.  Often feels too easy, but then I got absolutely chewed up in one game so maybe not?  I'd love to see the official solo player rules that are due out with the first expansion.

[With Allies, Madness, Delion Dryad, Hero Pack I, and Something Wicked]

Fun, entertaining, not as repetitive seeming as Arkham.  With 2 co-op doesn't seem a cakewalk, so far.

Too bad about the card art.  The rest is graphically very nice.  The expansions are useful to add variety, but do raise the probability of the randomness handing you a rather un-fun game.

A refreshing lighter version of zombies and Arkham merger. Nice storyline and very simple game play. A session can be done in an evening even with full compliment of gamers.

However, I still prefer Arkham Horror.

What is it with this game? Sure, it's got high quality bits, awesome figs and a nice theme, but the mechanics are fiddly and the game has more card decks than other games have cards. You roll buckets of dice, the rules are everything but elegant, and the whole process can sometimes feel very repetitive. Yet, I can't get enough of it! The mystery, the narrative, the cards, everything is just fun! Drawing Location Cards is always thrilling and suspenseful, and seeing the villain become more powerful by the minute is quite cool and stressful. My favorite solo game. For now, anyway.

Really enjoy the game love the expansions and the support FF have provided to keep the game fresh. the mechanics work well for a Horror theme, probably madness would be another theme to add in to a character, they either bleed or creep ever closer to insanity. The card play for clues and finding the lair of the villain is fun. the town elders and their secrets  are good, perhaps  need a bit more. One day I'll do a 1920's version to use with all my figures ....

I had heard many folks here at BGG say this was "Arkham Horror Lite". They are right and in my opinion it's a good thing since I like Arkham Horror but don't always have the desire to think that hard. Great theme that once again cements me as a Flying Frog fanboy. 
1st game was with wife - second was with 3 buddies... all fun and games till we start making our move for the villian and then the cut throat tactics I am used to come out. Had a blast 2nd time through

RATING: 9
Arkham Horror lite indeed. I desperately need to reevaluate this game. I liked it the times that I played, but finally set it aside when I decided the game was not as good as Arkham Horror. It was only just recently when I realized that, while Arkham Horror's event cards merge their flavor text with their mechanics text, A Touch of Evil's cards always make their flavor text separate. I never, not even once, read any of that flavor text. No wonder I didn't find the game as compelling. Now as part of its revival I have also started painting the miniatures. This game may have the biggest comeback in the history of my collection.

Essentially a roll and move game.  There are very few decisions at all.  You wander around the board and collect cards that you mostly draw randomly and hope you don't draw bad cards until you've gotten enough to take on the monster.

Are there any choices?  I made very few.  Theoretically you can choose where you move -- if you roll high enough.  But even then the differences between locations aren't that compelling.

Most cards you draw randomly, but there are a few that you can purchase.  So there's a potential choice there.  I identified a card that would work well with my character and tried to save up for it.  Unfortunately another character bought it first.

This was one of the most miserable gaming experiences I've had in a long time.  There's also little player interaction.  You just wait while other players roll and draw cards.  Thankfully, this part worked out well for me as I was able to excuse myself from the game without negatively affecting the game for the other players.

Thought the theme was pretty well done, but didn't find it to be a very enjoyable game.  Started out at a decent pace, but just took too long towards the end, and the game is just pretty dull at that point.  Good components, but not much to get excited about.

Pros -- fine production values, thematic in appearance...

Cons -- rulebook needs work (no index, nearly all text, few examples, few illustrations), somewhat fiddly gameplay, randomness and luck abound, dull mapboard with very small print, non-immersive gameplay, odd rulings (like how many items you are allowed to carry?, etc.), numerous items that can "break" certain game rules (like how many items you can carry, etc.), lots of "bookkeeping" activities, roll and move, and some "swingy" cards that can randomly appear...

Just misses being a decent RPG.  :(

RATING: 8.9
Took me a spell to get used to the photographed art style (friends, models, etc) but it really gives A Touch of Evil some personality, as with the other Flying Frog games. But what really puts this over the top is just how fun it is, 'Living in Salem, Mass, the Board Game', which sparks up nostalgia for my wife and I, who met in and used to live there. Anyway, lot of variability here with the core box villains and downloadable add-ons, plus there are a number of xpacs to look forward to...we enjoy this! Gothic horror circa Sleepy Hollow, Poe, and classic black & white era horror film and folklore monsters.

First Impressions: The best aspect of this game is that it's VERY thematic. It tells a different story every time it's played. With a wealth of cards and final bosses, the game certainly has alot of variety. However cooperative games are not among my favorites and in the end I always feel as if I haven't accomplished anything.

A great co-op game that can also be played competitively. Excellent imagery to make for an in-depth gothic horror themed game. A lighter version of Arkham horror, essentially, but definitely on par with it, if not better. If you're into thematic games, A Touch of Evil is probably for you!

A game that seems like it should tick all of my boxes (cool "Sleepy Hollow" theme, cards with lots of flavour text, a big bag of dice, published by the makers of Last Night on Earth) but which fell really flat. Where Last Night on Earth feels like an exciting zombie movie unfolding on your table, A Touch of Evil has no narrative flow, and is just a succession of unrelated event cards flipped over until someone decides to take on the bad guy, and then they either win or they don't while the other players look on. Dullsville.

My wife and I are huge co-op fans. Pandemic and Ghost Stories are 2 of our favorites. Sadly this one did not work for me. There just aren't many meaningful choices. The balance is also very hit and miss when you play the game as a co-op. When you want to play a co-op it is probably better to stick with a dedicated co-op. Games that try and do multiple modes rarely excel.

I really wish I had liked this game. From the delightfully corny nature of the art to the theme of warding off classic monsters and having an adventure to boot.

But this didn't really have any sense of impending doom to me. No real tension. The doom tracker moved way too slow and inconsistently. The cards didn't really tell much of the story that I was lead on to believe. Some games you get no monsters at all on the board for a  whiiiiiile while others you'll start off with a nice bang and suddenly the momentum will just stop cold. 

Also roll to move in this game doesn't feel quite right.

It's a shame. Sold a while ago.

Easy, thematic and random: I really couldn’t ask more of a game.

Yet A Touch of Evil goes even further, as it features light rules, fosters heavy interaction among the players, comes with first-rate components and on the whole it also makes for that deep experience I always enjoy in a game: all of this without vexing the players with complex or pointless mechanics.

Seems to be a lite version of Arkham Horror with simplified options at board locations and a the typical long dice-battle with the big-bad at the end.  I like the variety/replayability... choice of villains, co-op versus competitive, basic versus advanced rules, etc.  

So far I have played the co-op version twice.  Both games were long (but we had 7-8 players and several newbies in each game).  

RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT.  After my 2nd game, I feel like there is a lack of a sense of urgency in the BASIC CO-OP game (the game timer moves too slow if you're not triggering extra Mystery cards)... you can just daudle for a while until you get almost as many weapons as you want before attacking the villain... this takes a long time and the game overstays it's welcome.  I think part of the problem was that we just didn't end up with many minions on the board from lingering... so we didn't have blocked paths... and there's no good reason to go to the Marsh or other Event/Mystery card draw spaces (and risk the advance of evil) unless you are blocked.

RATING: 5
I wanted to like this game so badly. I love the theme even if it is derivative of a minor Tim Burton film. I really enjoy Last Night on Earth. A Touch of Evil just doesn't come together, though. The game consists of stocking up and then facing the baddie. There is little sense of pace or urgency, though, because, going to more locations provides a significant danger of losing the cards you've carefully acquired. That means more time retracing steps (you don't want to face the baddie defenseless) hoping again not to lose your advantages. It feels much like trying to create a house of cards again and again on a breezy day. The Town Elder mechanic is clever and you find yourself wanting it to work, but it shares its own level of randomness which laughs at your attempts to keep the interest in the game narrative foremost in your mind instead of simple frustration. This is too bad; there are neat elements here that could have been a part of a better game experience.

This game OOZES WITH THEME!

Seeing as how Sleepy Hollow is my favorite movie, you can bet your ass I love the theme!

Mechanically it's like a lighter Arkham Horror.
I love that it can be played either co-op or competitive.
I'm a big fan of the art style (of both the cards and the map. In fact it's my favorite board for any boardgame ever!).

I should state that I've never actually played the base game by itself (without any expansions). It seems like it would get old fairly quickly. That being said, just having one of the two main expansions (or even better, both) adds a TON to the game.

Nice game but I didn't warm up to it my first go... will have to see if I like it any better the next time.  My other games eclipsed my interest in it.  I keep it thinking we'll give it another shot when the time is right.

RATING: 3
THis is just a knock-off of Arkham Horror without FFG's stellar component quality and LOvecraftian theme. But that aside, there are a couple of problem here. First, I don't see much value in being the first person take on the bad guy. I made that mistake and paid for it dearly; my opponents unloaded all of their "take that" cards against me that forced me to lose. My character spent the rest of the game completely crippled and another player won the game. It seems like it's far better to wait in the wings; I hate that in a game. Second, the wording on the cards is horribly unclear; the game really needs some sort of consistent terminology to avoid misudnerstandings. Finally, I didn't care for the components, such as the weirdly lacquered cards and the ugly board with microscopic script.

I don't think I'll be playing this again...

Played a 4 player game and it was a blast.
We didn't play to the end, but it oozes theme and horror.

It is a bit like Arkham Horror but only on the light end. Some mechanics are quite similar, but it doesn't disturb the game.
A good evil game with a load of replayability with all the different villians and heroes.

It's a fun game, but the journey is more fun then the winning or losing.  Whoever gets the best card draws will win, but the story that unfolds is more entertaining then trying to win.  I think it get's a little long and am happy when it's over.

RATING: 6
Good theme. Horror game other than zombies or Chtulhu. Love the setting in the 17th (18th?) century in the small village where the citizens all have their little secrets..
Typical Flying Frog design with actors portraying the characters on the cards, wich I like. The map is beautiful. No minis for the monsters and the doublesided counters make it sometimes hard to find things.
Gameplay is a ton of dice roling...sometimes you role on tables that bring you to other tables to roll again on the first table and so on. Can be hard to keep track of things. As in many FF games, rules are often confusing and poorly organized with a lot of details but in the end the atmosphere is a great pay off. There´s also no real need to visit the expansion boards, so you might need some houserules there. 
Seems in many ways like Arkham Horror light, but doesn´t even come close to it.

A nicely thematic and very pretty game which doesn't overstay its welcome, like (for instance) Arkham Horror. The ending, however, is massively anticlimactic; once you're tooled up, defeating the villain is pretty much a foregone conclusion.

With the exception of a 2-hour play of "Heroes of Graxia" this was the worst gaming experience I ever had. We had one of the expansions and 7 players, and it was sheer torture for 3 or 4 hours before I gave my spot to another guy to end the misery. This is one of the worst games I've ever played; there are no meaningful decisions and everything you do takes all this fiddly die rolling, chart consulting, card shuffling, etc. It's horrid, and I will never play another game by this company because of it. And the so-called 'artwork' is just plain horrendous. I rate this game a 1, and mean it.

Not a perfect game but excellent if you just want to become part of an adventure for an evening. Not as slick as games like Arkjam Horror the LCG, but to a certain extent it's a lot simpler.

Played the game for the first time last weekend with people not familiar with the whole character building RPGlite concept. It took a bit but they were remarkably into the game by the time we were facing the main bad guy. I suspect the game will hit the table again. I give it a solid seven. It's much easier to teach than Arkham Horror and can be played in a much shorter time, but there is still a good story element to the fun. It seems that the cooperative game may be a bit too easy with only one Mystery card being drawn every full game turn. Next time we'll try competitive and see if that get's a bit tighter.

RATING: 6
It is basically Talisman with a horror theme instead of fantasy.  Move around the board beating challenges (using the combat system ripped straight from FFG's Arkham Horror) to get loot to improve your character and eventually challenge the bad guy to win.  I like Talisman and I like Arkham Horror - this game is a hybrid of the two that I do not like as much.

RATING: 8
I really like this one, and I'm eager to play it again.  The theme appeals to me a lot more than Arkham Horror's Cthulhu mythos.  Does everything that Arkham Horror does in two hours or less.  Touch of Evil can also be played copetitively or co-op, which is a big bonus.

A streamlined Arkham Horror.  Love the atmosphere and speed of play.  Also really like how the table looks with all three boards laid out (if you own the expansions).

RATING: 4
This is only for the cooperative game. During the whole game the optimal play is to just sit in the town where the events are almost all good, let the monsters come to you, and increase the attribute you'll use to fight the big boss (and buy items that you'll use to fight the big boss). And then as time starts to run out, go and kill the big boss. This is quite dull.

Hopefully the competitive game is good and it is the cooperative game that is tacked on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on the cooperative game:

The co-op game feels like Last Night on Earth meets Arkham Horror. The theme and flavor are top-notch. The gameplay is a pretty run of the mill co-op affair (town is infested with monsters, roll some dice to fight them, collect some form of currency, roll some dice to fight The Big Bad before time runs out.)

There are a good amount of rules ambiguities here. Some really basic stuff isn't even stated for the Horseman scenario in particular.

I don't know why the rulebook stresses that you should really play the Basic game before the Advanced version... there's only like two extra rules in Advanced. The game isn't more complex in Advanced so much as more difficult. The game felt a lot more unbalanced (in favor of the heroes) during the one Basic game we played.

I'm not sure how I feel about the way the Shadow Track works. I think the overall pacing of the game would have been better had it been a set number of turns. As it is, I foresee it making the game feel like it's either dragging out or being cut short since it's controlled by random factors. It also affects how tense the game feels - it's hard to gauge how "bad" things are if the track is moving at a variety of speeds.

It's going to take me a few more plays to get the hang of the timing - I'm not quite sure when to end the "running around gathering items and preparing" phase and when it's best to really start fighting the Villain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very much a game like Arkham Horror (AH) with a few game play differences here and there. Game length is about the same. Can be played in competitive or co-op mode which is a plus for me. Also really like the "secrets" mechanism for town elders. 

The "standard game" feels a bit slow and is a bit to repetitive for my taste. If I have to choose between a game of AtoE or AH, AH wins for me.

It's "Arkham Horror-Lite." Similar feel, different theme/time period. Also, it's a Vs. game (while there is a co-op variant).

RATING: 7.8
A Touch of Evil has a nice premise and theme. It has great quality components.

However, its luck factor and the massive amount of book-keeping it requires, make it hard to enjoy at times: the main aspects of the game are card-drawing and dice-rolling. There is little tactic involved. (The Something Wicked expansion includes a second game board, which contains locations with encounters that change this and increase controlability.)
As for book-keeping: about one in three Mystery (bad) cards remains in play and has to be taken into account in every subsequent turn. This can really add up as the game progresses and the use of tactical card placement (Mystery or Event card related Remains-in-play cards can e.g. be put face-up on top of the deck it relates to) and unconventional use of tokens (e.g. wound tokens on the board) can be required to keep proper track of everything.

Mystery cards tend to be overpowered, sometimes ruining the game early on.

The consequences of death can range from trivial to downright ending the game for you: if you have lots of investigation or if you happen to be lucky when rolling the die, you are on your merry way in no time; if not, you may lose everything that offered you some chance of winning at all.

The use of charts to roll on in addition to the Mysery cards reduce the flavour of the game. Fortunately, most chart use is optional.

It is possible to lose the game without any showdown with the villain. Worse yet: there is even a card ("Evil is on the move") that actively tries to PREVENT all showdowns. The entire game is about preventing the villain to get too powerful for anyone to be able to beat him, yet instead of ending with a very unbalanced, near-impossible forced showdown, your characters are just supposed to leave town or something once word reaches them that the villain is too powerful. I find it illogical, unthematic, anticlimatic and just no fun at all for a game to end this way.

On the other side, this game can be played both competitively, co-operatively and solo, which is quite an achievement! The fact that every villain and every hero (and their combinations) really alter the game, makes for great diversity and replayability. Since it is not too hard to come up with your own custom heroes and villains, you can add content and diversity yourself quite easily, especially for solo play (since you need not worry about overpowered heroes spoiling other players' fun).

I had to LEARN how to enjoy this game and I found there are precious few villains I ENJOY fighting. Some just keep the game dragging along while others tend to make me lose the game without a showdown every time. However, I just play with the heroes and villains that work for ME, and I keep in mind that luck is very influential and that a game won or lost is not necessarily won or lost because of my (lack of) skill. It just has to be one big adventure where your character just HAPPENS to be in the right spot at the right time to find an item rather than an assaillant. Accepting that made me enjoy this game a lot. When I feel like having quite a bit of control over what is going on in my game world, I play something else, though.

That was in July 2011. Now, almost 5 years later, I find I do not like this game as much as I want to. Rolling on an event chart is flavourless and not doing it makes the game quite easy. I think the element of luck is way too much of a determining factor. This has rarely made it to my table and I never introduced anyone to it as I do not know anyone who would enjoy it.

Its a similar set of mechanics to Last Night on Earth, but not as good a game. The plot follows a monster outbreak in 17th century New England, and the players are the monster hunters. Think along the lines of Sleepy Hollow and you have it.

Played it once as the competitive simple version, did nothing for me as it really was just "multiplayer solitaire" there was very little a person could do to influence the actions of another player (I was limited to following the leader, so that when I got attacked maybe they would too). It is probably better as a co-op game, but then why not break out Arkahm Horror. The artwork was really snazzy, though.

A Touch Of Evil is fine. The Coast expansion is fine. The Madness & The Allies supplements seem cool.

But the set I got in a trade is less notable than Arkham Horror, less adventurous and streamlined than Eldritch Horror, and less satisfying as a dice roller than Elder Sign.

As a player of all three of those already I don't imagine this will get any play time whatsoever. To be traded.

Top thematic horror coop (or competitive) that takes 2h when over the steep learning cliff. The game is simple, but its situational combinations create lots of corner cases that need research or freestyle interpretation. The components and artwork are top notch, and the gameplay evocative and quasi-RPG. Expansions are a must as they give more location cards, heroes, villains and the like. 

However, I just cannot be bothered anymore with FAQs and fiddliness and I am also not fond anymore of bucket-o-dice end boss fights, so I likely won't keep this and its expansions. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is fun so far. It sits somewhere between Arkham and Eldritch on the rule overload scale, but closer to Arkham.

I absolutely love the theme and how it comes through. I just feel sometimes it has too much overhead. I look forward to more plays, either way, as it will most likely be played instead of Arkham when I feel like this type of game.

RATING: 9
A really good game.  I did feel something was missing, but that tiny void was filled with the expansions.

Really only one board expansion is needed to do this.  Now, I just can't get enough of this great game.

Some have compared it to Arkham Horror as a lite version.
Initially, I had thought this, but really they are 2 different types of games with different themes.

My rating is based on the Coop aspect.  Although it can be played competitively, I have enough competitive games, and am tired of the same old thing.

Cooperative is how I like to play this.  How well can you work together?

 Bring it out every year in the fall and play it through December. In December I play vs. The Nutcracker and Krampus.
Need at least 1 expansion to make this game work because the base game board is too small for a good play through. Recommend both big box and the 2nd small box expansions for the best gaming. Anything else is flavor. You may need to take out some cards sometimes unless you don't mind a case of extremely bad luck. For instance I take out the Mystery card that makes you roll for each book in the game with a chance of taking them out of the game if a player is playing the character whose power it is to get additional dice through books.

RATING: 8
Preliminary rating after just 2 plays... First time: 4 players vs. Horseman (basic game, competitive); second time: 4 players vs. the Scarecrow, using the advanced rules & optional showdown chart. The basic game seemed pretty dull to everyone involved... the shadow track progressed slowly, not much happened and the "big bad" went down without much of a fight. It took a bit of coaxing to get the game to the table a second time. But so much of what I'd read about AToE convinced me that this game HAD to be a good time, I persisted & my friends acceded. Fortunately, the SECOND game was a rousing success! Events unfolded quickly, the shadow track progressed at a much faster rate, the "big bad" was much, much tougher and the game ended in a breakneck, breathless showdown with all 4 battered and bloodied heroes pulling off a seemingly impossible win in the absolute nick of time. We were all VERY glad we'd given the game a second chance.

Update: After dropping my rating a bit (the game had started to feel old and predictable), I've bumped it back up now that the Something Wicked expansion has renewed my group's interest (and mine).

Update: Added "The Coast" and one of the Hero Packs. It's now a big, sprawling monster with all the bells and whistles you could want... and it's a great, fun time!

I think with 3-4 players this will be a winner for me.

It's Arkham Horror light after undergoing the Flying Frog treatment.

This game makes you understand why Arkham Horror has turns broken down into rounds, so everyone moves, then everyone has an encounter etc.  This really suffers when one player has a massive turn, moving, searching, fighting and so on - and then the next player rolls 2 and gets to stand on a road and then wait 10 minutes to roll the dice again.  Theme, components - fantastic, but can go a bit wonky and I've reduced my rating and would pick Arkham Horror over this these days, for the same trick only done better - and more crazy.

RATING: 7
A solid game that unfortunately requires the Something Wicked expansion to up its status (and fun factor).

Colonial monster hunters descend on the hamlet of Shadowbrook.  The town, plagued by one of the handful of villains available to the game, is in peril.  It is up to the monster hunters to eradicate the vile creature in a bloody final showdown before the villain's corrupting influence envelops the town and surrounding countrysides.  

But beware of the town elders in your final hunting party, for one of them may be aligned with the evil that terrorizes the more noble townsfolk.

Fun, but not enough meat on its bare bones to inspire devotion.  With that said, A Touch of Evil is greatly enhanced by its next two expansions.  Something Wicked, in particular, seems to complete the game.

Es pot jugar com a Coop o Comp.
En mode Competitiu, és com una carrera per equipar-te i enfrontar-te al monstre abans que els altres.
La sensació és que estàs tota la partida entotxant-te a vegades per res, pq arriba un abans que tu i pela al monstre. Però si no t'entotxes prou, saps que no tens garanties... així que el mode competitiu està xulo però és una mica coitus-interruptus.
L'haurem de provar un dia en Coop.

It is really unfortuate. Such a great production value, such a beautiful thematic 19th century map and they're going with the stills from some B-movie? It is cheesy and annoying. But the game itself is great fun. A light wight mystery solving experience with battle and co-operative play. Not bad at all.

This is what Talisman should have been.  Campy horror theme, but a real sense of discovery beyond just roll & move.  I enjoyed this more than I expected to, definitely more than Last Night On Earth which is better than the average zombie game, but didn't really make me want to run out and try it again.  This one I could see playing a lot, both competitively and cooperatively.

Light hearted D&D game that's pretty chaotic really. Movement is random, cards are random and combat (and other actions) are all dice based. So, you can only kind-sorta formulate a plan, and the rest is out of your control.

I love how thematic the game is, however after five plays it doesn't feel like there is much to the game besides the theme. I don't even have Arkham Horror but really want to try it since it seems like this is a stripped version.

Note: Not much of a stickler for boxes but seriously this is "almost" the same size as other games ex. Cosmic Encounter/Formula D/Aquaretto/etc, however it is just slightly bigger. Its hard to tell by just looking at it but it will not fit two side by side on my shelves because of this. This wouldn't bother me, IF they had given ample room in the box for all the pieces, I was barely able to fit everything in, why not just make the box bigger for an easy fit seriously.

I guess I should say more now, I really feel like the shadow track does not go down nearly fast enough. In coop you just sit there with everyone else making yourselves unstoppable, while in competative, you just grab afew good items and save up for a lair card and kill the boss. Usually we finish up really fast which kills the "thematic" experience the game is supposed to have, and which is all the game really has going for it.

I really like the look of the board, and wish they'd done all the art in that style.  The game itself is just ok - we found the scarecrow too easy and didn't really break a sweat in murderizing it.  Would have been more appropriate to call it A Touch of Ennui.

I label this as 'Arkham Horror Light'.  It has a very similar gameplay but it doesn't take nearly as long.  In some ways, it's not as in-depth, but that isn't bad.

Very nice artwork, as FFP use to do. Mechanics is absolutely simple. In case you like dice -> it's for you. (CD) Music is very thematic - however very short. Good quality components (cards, figures, board) - if you like to hunt the vilaian instead of fighting with with the ancient one - go for it :) Do not expect that the game will be friendly with you. It uses every single opportunity to smack you.

RATING: 4
I had mostly dismissed A Touch of Evil as "Arkham Lite" in the past. While I think my initial impression of it is still relatively solid, A Touch of Evil brings one item to the table that I think is worth exploring: a competitive monster hunting game. The single play I had of it was interesting in this respect, and it seemed that there was plenty of interesting stress points that are worth exploring to see how the game ticks. I half expect that the game will end up either being broken or influenced enough by randomness that playing it as a true competitive game will not be worthwhile. And if it is not, I will happily never play it again and return to Arkham.

RATING: 5
Players wander around town, investigating and ultimately trying to defeat the evil infecting it.  Similar presentation to Flying Frog's other game, Last Night On Earth, with quality components, and actor/models featured everywhere.  However, the game is more in the Talisman mould - roll a die, wander around town getting stronger, and ultimately taking on the big bad during a climactic finale. Interesting sub-game where you are investigating the town elders, to see if they are good or evil, and whether they will help you in the final battle.  Players have to keep the pace up as there is a ticking clock - a track that counts down before evil takes over the town.  Initial impressions are favorable, but need to play more.  Perhaps the game seems a bit easy, so we need to try the advanced game, and plug in the optional rules.

So having played this a couple more times, I feel the difficulty decreases the more characters you have, at least if you're doing co-op.  Maybe teams would be better?  It's definitely fun, but I think I need some more plays to really get the feel of this.  The expansion looks good, too.

Arkham Lite?  Meh. Sure it has some similarities, but the game itself is a *completely* different experience.  The biggest similarity it has to Arkham Horror is that it requires you have a functioning imagination to truly enjoy it; if you do not have one of these, consider yourself warned.

Mechanics-wise, the Town Elders is what makes this game truly stand out.  Components-wise, as with all FFP games, it needs absolutely no help in standing out.

Gets bonus points for having cooperative and competitive play modes.

Also gets bonus points for having solitaire rules (in the expansion).

2nd Play: 3-player co-op w/ [thing=42047][/thing].  Finished in 2 hrs. vs. The Werewolf.  Ouch!  The Werewolf was tough.  We had 2 showdowns w/ the villain & lost.  I see gameplay/game-feel similarities w/ [thing=29368][/thing].  Strictly my opinion, when either of these games are good, they are really really good (edge of my seat to the end).  Otherwise, you can forsee the outcome.

Very fun thematic gothic horror game set around 1802. Reminds me of Talisman and Arkham Horror and its own thing blended together. 

The characters you choose at start are quite fun and varied. Depending on the various villains, the game changes its flavor and feel based on the one selected at start. Very good game for what it is! 

Adventure Game.

This is arguably better than either Talisman or Arkham Horror. The two games its most similar two. Mostly because it shouldn't last longer than 3 hours tops, the other two games i've mentioned can both seriously drag. Its classic AT, the fun comes from flipping event cards and seeing what horrors or rewards await. It has a few more decisions than talisman, but is lighter than Arkham and with a coop and multiplayer setup. The coop isn't as strong as other coop games. Components are top quality and personally i like the art. Worth a look if you like light roll and move adventures.

Played once, five-player competitive game.
While I'm a big fan of LNOE, I found this game session lacking. LNOE does a better job of building a theme, and Touch of Evil seemed more abstract. 
The limiting factor in our session seemed to be the economy, there just wasn't enough money flowing around to purchase Lair cards. 
Why do you have to a) Purchase a Lair card and then b) Pay to enter the Lair? It's a terrible time/money sink!
I'm sure it plays faster with fewer people, but I can't recommend a competitive game with based on our experience. Everyone ended up helping the first player to attack the Villain, just to make the game end after 3+ hours.

Played with 8 people, and all I wanted to do was find the fastest way for us to lose. The game starts by rolling dice to find the start player... and never develops beyond that. All you do is mindlessly roll dice to beat other dice rolls. So Pointless. Why remake Talisman?!

The use of the staged photos for card art is a new twist.

RATING: 6
One thing is clear -- the designers and Flying Frog know gamers and how to put together a game.  From the haunting CD background music to the handful of unnecessary dice so that people needn't pass all the time, this is a beautifully and very well organized game.  The game itself, though, is very derivative of Arkham Horror.  There is a shadow/terror track, there are location decks, there is a Mythos/Mystery deck, and, of course, there is a super villian with lots of minions.  Is it Arkham Horror lite?  I guess.  But Arkham horror isn't really all that heavy, and there is much more going on in that game.  In ToE players are generally just running around trying pick up  weapons/items so as to be the first one able to beat up the baddy.  It's enjoyable, but it is hard not to shake the feeling that you would really rather be playing Arkham Horror.

I tried this as a competitive team game and it fell completely flat. I knew it was a Flying Frog, light, dice rolling game but it just went off the rails in terms of balance and tension. The other team was so stocked up on cards they had a counter for everything. No tension as a result. We all just wanted it to end.

But the next day, a friend came over and we tried it 2P competitively with some new rules I either made up myself or cobbled together from the BGG variants forum. Usually trying to fix a game is a waste of time, but I'm happy to report that tension was created and balance well enough for us. 

[i]Movement 
1) Either 3 minus your wounds or 
2) the roll of a die. If you choose to roll, you must accept the results. A 1 gives you an Event card as a bonus.

Lair Cards
May only be purchased when the Shadow Track crosses into a new section or is in the final section 

Hand Size
You can hold seven cards of any configuration total. The four cards that allow you to hold extra cards are removed. If you draw an eighth card, you may discard one that you have to keep it. 

Knockouts
You must lose a card.

Mystery Phase
Roll a die and consult the chart:
1= the Shadow Track moves 2 to the right
2= the Shadow Track moves 1 to the right
3,4,5= resolve a Mystery card
6= place two investigation randomly

Secrets
The elders are placed randomly at the start of the game. You must travel to them to investigate them. Place no more than one per space. For 1 investigation, you can discard an elder's Secret card. 

Victory Conditions
Add: If 4 of the elders are ever killed, the Shadow forces win. 

Collecting Investigation
You may either interact with the space you're in OR collect all the investigation chits in the space.

I eventually got rid of the game, but I see it’s fairly popular on the Solitaire Games on Your Table monthly geeklist which tells me that perhaps the game’s best implementation is as a thematic solo adventure.

Many people, including the guy who convinced me to play this game, describe it as a streamlined Arkham Horror. After my first (and probably only) play, I would call it a variation on Talisman: you roll a die, move up to that many spaces, and more often than not draw a card. Repeat for an awful number of hours. There are no real choices in this game: it's random stuff on top on random stuff. The combat mechanics are particularly bad: both you and the monster/minion roll your dice and score hits independently, which means that it doesn't really matter how strong you are: a weak monster can STILL take you down. And then there are the Banshee's shade minions, who inflict an extra hit every time you roll a 1, effectively making large dice pools a DISADVANTAGE. Horrible.

Overall, I feel like this is one of the worst games I've ever played: long, boring and unsatisfying. Won't likely play this again.

This coop game has a unique historical setting around the turn of the 18th-19th centuries, which sets it up for a variety of classic evil bad guys for you to work together to fight! Great characters. Great cards. Great game mechanics. Great mood. And almost anyone can play it. Could be the highlight of a small Halloween party! All that said, it is a really long game and needs at least some of the expansions to reach its full potential. The variety of the expansions makes this a family favorite.

RATING: 4
Roll and move game where you just sort of end up milling around the board amassing stuff for no real reason taking repetitive turn after repetitive turn.
The game practically plays itself  and you make no meaningful decisions.

The cards that you draw can be good, bad or very very mediocre and there is no way to predict, plan or even mitigate what type of random card you happen to draw each turn, and there are a lot of the mediocre cards in the decks.

When you feel your character is tooled up enough you can go and take on the big bad. The villains do all have a very different flavour but ultimately this does NOT come through in game play where they all play in an almost identical way, with maybe a villain specific quirk thrown in. 

In the co-operative game at least the villain is very very lacklustre as you chuck as many dice as you can at it and it chucks them right back until only one of you is standing. In theory this could be a tense, interesting push your luck sort of mechanic however heroes heal between rounds and can swap in/out equipment and the villain cant so they lose EVERYTIME!
If the villains are no threat, what is the point in playing?

Sold in 2015.

too much dice rolling for my taste. Sometimes during play you have teh feeling that you have to roll dice for every thought of an action and after you did your actions there are some bad events but instead of just let them happen you roll dice to check if they happen then you roll dice to check what event happens then you roll again to determine the outcome of the event...

Random x random. Perhaps the best immersion I have seen for a horror game, but the ability to feel like a story is developing is thwarted by each event randomy occuring so the connective story line and sleuthing has to be imagined. 

Still, it's lots of silly fun with the right group, it's just not quite the creepy game I want it to be due to the randomly generated story that is generic for all the evil characters.

Between the setting, the many ways to play it (cooperative, competitive, team) plus the great support from Flying Frog on giving more variety with free villains on their site just makes this game great. Love the modularity to the board where you can connect many of the expansion boards to fill in the world more while not overshadowing the main board. 

Highly recommended for horror game fans, cooperative/story game players!

Only real flaw I have to the game is that with the high gloss on the cards & tokens, they sometimes will stick together & would definitely recommend sleeving the cards. Plus the wound tokens match the icon on the hero boards/cards which just blend together at quick glance to see if someone is wounded or not.

10/13/08--It's an Arkham Lite.  I like it, it's pretty fun.  Nice production quality, and unlike some I think the photos and music CD are all part of the charm.

Instead of being cookie cutter, they're going for their own vibe which is cool.

There's some flaky little rules in there (like some of the villain AI/encounter rolls) and there could be more variety in the encounter decks (roll X, get clues for each Y+).

Still, rating might actually go up after more plays.  I don't think the Spectral Horseman is the most interesting villain, and he was the one featured in our first game.

I've played the basic cooperative (solo) game with 4 heroes. It was a lot of fun but seems like your more or less hanging out building up some strength and then going in for the kill. It was fun though. I'll need to play a few more rounds with some expansions and/or play the advanced game to get a better feel for it. 

It almost seems this game appears to be some deep neat game with a lot of fiddly, but doesn't appear to actually be that way. There's lot of random drawing of cards and it can be interesting to see what surfaces. The game might not hold up in the long run for replay value, but I'd need to play it more to make and accurate judgement.

Classic Ameritrash - you roll a lot of dice and then nothing very exciting happens. The bits are absolutely gorgeous, and if you like this sort of game you'll love this one. If you're looking for the board game version of the movies Sleepy Hollow or The Village, this is for you. Just don't ask me to play with you.

RATING: 6
This took the mantle place from Arkham Horror for me.  It provides a lot of the same feel, but with a lot less set-up time and smoother game play - plus the ability to play both competitively and cooperatively is a  huge bonus.  The town elder mechanism is unique and very cool adding mystery to player's potential allies in the hunt for the uber evil.  A Touch of Evil offers a lot of flavor in a fairly quick play time.

UPDATE:  I think my first comment was based on the set and setting.  Much like Tim Leary noted the two are very important to one's enjoyment of an experience.  Further playings have reduced my favor, and it's definitely no Arkham Horror.

I think the idea behind this game is great but I find that the rulebook was poorly arranged and therefore made it very hard to understand initially.

Everyone who has played this has liked it a lot, including my non-gamer girlfriend. That being said, there's a lot of luck here and little strategy/choice. The stuff that happens is less thematic than Arkham Horror, and more blah mechanic kind of stuff. Combat is fairly boring at times, except for the showdown which can be fun. And I'm sure not every hero or villain is created equal.
With all those caveats aside, the game is pretty quick, lots of fun, and very competitive. It's not the best thing out there, but it certainly provides an enjoyable time.

This use to be our top game. It is still pretty great, but I feel like we own better games now. I'm sure it will still get some love, especially around October because the theme is so fantastic.  There are elements that I'm not too crazy about in this game, and the amount of 'stuff' is verging on ridiculous.  I feel like for a 2 player game, the whole town elder mechanic really falters, and we often just ignore the whole town elder secret part of the game.

Found the game play surprisingly disappointing.  As a fan of Arkham Horror, I found this game too light to be at all satisfying.

I enjoyed playing this, but it is so close to Arkham Horror that you don't really get much by choosing to play the apprentice rather than the master.

Now Witches of Salem is light enough that you get a huge time reduction and yet scratch the same Great Old One fighting itch as Arkham. 

The jury is still out for me on this game. I really wanted to like it more because I love the Last Night on Earth game so much by the same designers. Like I said, the game works and is fun, I just wonder what it has that the truly awesome Arkham Horror doesn't have.

The Flying Frogs do Runebound, with buckled shoes and tricorn hats replacing greaves and helmets. This game firmly resides in the Talisman-Prophecy-Runebound axis, with all the weaknesses of the form -- it can run long, it is relentlessly random, and it is basically a resource/race game that kind of accidentally constructs an adventure game narrative as it unfolds. But there are some welcome improvements -- a very handsome production overall, multiple modes of play, variable enemies, the intriguing Town Elders who may be allies or enemies, nicely executed theme, and a wonderfully cheesy CD soundtrack. I like it, but I wouldn't play with more than three. And I take it about as seriously as Last Night On Earth, which is to say not at all.

RATING: 8
Take away the horror theme and ATOE is far from an original idea. Simply put, move around the board to gather items and advance a character's abilities so you can eventually fight an ultimate evil; Sounds like Talisman (with dragons), Return of the Heroes, and Runebound. 
ATOE does contain quality components, similar to other Flying Frog products. Nice artwork on cards, board, counters, etc. Simple rules and quick game rounds keep the game fast and fun.
When compared to LNOE, a player does not take the role of the evil entity, and ATOE is more abstract than LNOE. Thus, player interaction is decreased, the evil entity loses character, and the overall horror theme/feel is diminished. In the end, the game feels like the aforementioned fantasy games (in the competitive version). 
My rating is for the competative version with the advanced rules;  Otherwise, the game is way to easy for any experienced gaming group.  Almost all of my coop games have been anti-climactic. The characters have been too over-powering for the creature to stand a chance. Thus, the game does not retain the feel of imminent danger or foreboding menace. It's more like going through the paces. The advanced competative version, on the other hand, can be challenging.

The art is pretty good and the rules are simpler than Arkham Horror.  But, I don't like the theme as much, and the gameplay seems significantly more repetitive, and I don't like Arkham Horror all that much to begin with.  The game is waaaayyyy too long for what you get.

I really want to like this Arkham Horror-lite game. The theme works well, the components look terrific and the mechanics of the tried-and-true kind.
However, AToE comes off as somewhat less than the sum of its parts. The gameplay seems a bit too repetitive (despite the loads of cards etc. offering variation), and I simply don't find the game intense or dynamic enough. Still, it's certainly enjoyable enough and with the right group, should provide extra fun.

It's not as good as Last Night on Earth, which is what it will inevitably be compared to. There's less control and tactics here. The theme is great and every bit as immersive though.

This seems to be one of those games I like more than other people, so it may be tough to get to the table.

This is another tremendous game from Flying Frog. 

It definitely has the feeling of an old supernatural movie where a villain terrorizes a small town and a band of heroes must fight to save it. 

The pieces, cards, and other components are of the high quality that I have come to expect from FFP.

The game can play competitively, cooperatively, with competitive teams, or solo. And it plays well in all of them, showing that the design was well-conceived. 

If you like experiencing movies like Sleepy Hollow, and like immersive board games, this is the game for you.

After playing the basic game, I like how easily the game is to play and understand without taking multiple hours upon hours to play. It's deep enough to have multiple strategies and completely envelopes the theme. I like the re-inactment type art and the matted parchment sketch map. It reminds me slightly of Runebound. 

And, any game that comes with its own soundtrack looks promising.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The main reason I bought AToE was because the theme absolutely hooked me (yes - I'm shallow); I'm a complete sucker for that whole 18th century horror vibe.  I'd also heard it described as an "Arkham Horror lite", so a purchase was pretty inevitable.

This has only hit the table once as it sort of outstayed its welcome by about 30 minutes.  The first 75% of the game proved a complete hit with all of the players - brilliant fun.  The flow of the game reached a point where we all felt we'd played long enough and were ready to take on the Villain. Unfortunately we weren't.  The next half hour then became a bit of a slog as we all attempted to gain the necessary extra few items etc. required to go toe-to-toe with the Headless Horseman.  At the finish I had a suicidal rush at him in a desperate attempt to bring play to a close.  Freakish dice rolls ensured that game ended and even the losing players were relieved.

The component quality is excellent and do a great job of evoking the "headless Hollow" theme.  It even inspired my to attempt to paint minis for the first time: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/751493/a-touch-of-evil-the-supernatural-game?size=large

I'm looking forward to playing this again but need to check out some variants to make the game either slightly shorter, or add more purpose to the run up to the Showdown.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Overall, AToE gives me some of the same buzz as Prophecy, Arkham Horror, and even Betrayal at House on the Hill. That's not to say that it's derivative, just that at certain points we've said, "Wow! this feels like 'such-n-such'!" Since I like all of those games, this aspect is not a negative.

Our first game (Basic, competitive) crapped out about 30 minutes into it. The other players grew increasingly bored and called a halt! I played again solitaire later that same night and had a pretty good time. Considering how badly it flopped with my group I suspect I'll only be playing it solitaire from now on. Sad really.

Like Last Night on Earth's musical 'offering' the less said about the CD soundtrack the better. It's an intriguing idea, but...

LATER: Convinced some other players to try this. Although enjoyable, those mid-game doldrums which kick in about 30 minutes into the game are a killer!

The weird turn order sequence doesn't help. Being the First player in one turn, then Last player in the next turn makes people yawn!

MUCH LATER: We are trying some variant rules where turns proceed around the table normally; and at the end of each Hero turn the player reads a Mystery card and rolls on the Co-op table!

This is necessary to increase the difficulty of the game to the point where it makes sense to play. See, we've never seen a Villain victory. In fact, because of the "I Say..." and "Reassuring Speech" cards, we cannot imagine a Villain victory with the co-op rules as written! This utter lack of threat coming from the Villain makes the co-operative game lack any tension whatsoever! If you cannot lose the co-operative game, why waste 90 minutes of your precious life playing it?!

One wag even quipped, "Wanna play the short version of the co-op game? We sit around and congratulate ourselves on a fine win!"

So, for us, only the competitive version has any value -- and that just barely.

We're also considering introducing the concept of Hero death just to make this game seem less like a Disney movie!

I simply like games where it's possible to lose! My rating has gone from a 9 to a 7 to a 4 as the realization sunk in that ATOE co-op mode is broken and comp mode is so much easier than Prophecy, Runebound, or even Return of the Heroes that there's little reason to play it other than the theme.

This is all really sad. The components are top-notch, especially the mapboard which I consider a work of art. The whole package just oozes period flavor, like something written by Nathaniel Hawthorne or Washington Irving. Yet the co-operative game seems nothing more than an afterthought and the competitive version suffers from lack of development and playtesting. So much potential, so little delivery. I'd rate our heavily house-ruled version of ATOE a 6. Out of the box, it's a 4.

Wander round town, fight monsters, tool up, smackdown on the big bad guy. It's a familiar story, but one that plays in 90 minutes so it's a good substitute for Arkham Horror if you don't have the time for that. Doesn't have the quite same atmosphere as Arkham but it's still a fun ride.

RATING: 8
Often dismissed as "Arkham Horror Lite," this game still is able to bring it's own personality to the game table. Like AH, your 'investigator' is moving between creepy locations searching for 'clues' which you use as a form of currency to find items and improve die rolls.  All players are playing against the game it's self rather than each other, so cooperation is encouraged.  As time goes on, the sinister forces become more and more powerful until eventually there is a final show-down between the investigators and the ultimate evil.  Unlike AH, you can also use your acquired clues to learn secrets from the town elders (some of which my be in league with the forces of evil) and search for the lair of the evil creature that haunts the town.  This leads to an actual sense of mystery and investigation that Arkham Horror fails to provide.  It also sets-up and plays much faster than AH. 
AToE is definitely simpler and faster than AH and comparisons are inevitable, but it is unfair to dismiss it as a 'lite' version of another game.  AToE is more than capable of standing on it's own among game heavy-weights.

Played a 4-player cooperative and a 2-player team game (we each had a team of 2 heroes). A Touch of Evil is am improvement on Jason Hill's previous zombie-themed effort - both in terms of theme and mechanics. The competitive aspect, in particular, works well and elevates the game above it predecessor. Nevertheless, it is still a game of die-rolling, moving and picking cards from decks; most player decisions are relatively trivial. Thus it is worth playing if you can finish a game in an hour, but cannot justify a longer session.

Total dice fest that's too long for its own good.  I enjoyed the session but the table turns into a mess of chips, chits, cards, and dice.  The art is weird, moving from decent horror paintings to real actors in goofy rennfair clothing.  For the kind of game it is (build up your character pseudo-RPG), I'd rather play something else.

RATING: 5.2
I can see how it's easier and lighter than Arkham Horror but still, I was checking the rulebook almost every single turn. Maybe I was just tired or something, I'm going to reread the rulebook to make sure I got everything right and then give it another try. There also appeared to be a number of holes in the ruleset.  Maybe a reread of the rules will resolve some of that but I'm not sure since LNoE had similar issues.

My main attractions to this game are the theme and the fact that while I loved Arkham Horror, my game group did not...not at all.  Mostly that was due to the game length and complex rules. I'm hoping this gets better as it seems it could be a good fix to those issues.

RATING: 9
I enjoy this but not as much as Flying Frog's previous masterwork "Last Night on Earth."

The theme is great, but the art could have been much better.  The game looks almost the same as LNOE in many areas, instead of doing anything to stand on its own visually.  Cheesy horror movie photos worked well for the zombie game, but not as well for this Sleepy Hollow like tale.

Gameplay is fun and ties into the theme quite well.

I probably like this game more that it deserves.  Roll and move, collect cards, collect enough to beat the bad guys.  I just really get a kick out of playing it in co-op and that's why I've given it the 8.  It's not for everyone, no great depth, but bloody good fun.

2013-08-13

Initial rating: 5.0 (August 2013)

An average game with gorgeous art and components. It was actually better than I expected it to be. The soundtrack has not improved since I heard the one that came with LNOE. When my friend was explaining the game, it seemed like a great game, however, the downtime is excessive for what it offers (and downtime is the worst a boardgame can do in my book). I think this is best played with 3, 4 player max. I will play it again to re asses my opinions in this regard. It is only exciting at the beginning, but after many turns you are willing to sacrifice yourself if only that will end the game.

The game components are great, the minis and map are really detailed, it is somewhat reminiscent of Arkham Horror, but I feel this is a very inferior and lighter game. 

The competitive facet of the game have no appeal to me as you win if you threw better dice than your opponents, perhaps I would like more the Cooperative version (which I have not played). Also being first to attack the bad guy is, generally, a bad idea, so than makes the game a lot longer than it should be.

I expected more flavor text in the cards, most of them are boring to play as they only depict the event/item with little backstory. What I’m saying is that the game has not enough theme or narrative (another point in which Arkham Horror wins over this one).

I won’t actively pursue more plays of A Touch of Evil: The Supernatural Game, however as many friends like it, I’m willing to give it another chance (preferably with the CoOp version).  

Current Rating: 5.0
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I'm just too used to cooperative games that kick the players' asses.  The tension in our Werewolf battle was almost nonexistent, as we ended up wasting multiple turns near the end of the game on power-ups.  Wolvie was toast in just a couple turns thanks to the schoolteacher with two books, a pistol, and silver shot.  I think she inflicted 17 of the 26 total damage.

Mechanically it's not bad, and corrects some of the mistakes Talisman made as far as lack of control over movement.  But it definitely got boring about a half hour in, and I'm not sure I'm interested in investing another session to work out the kinks.  Maybe on Halloween.

As for the competitive game, from what I've seen it would likely be more "take-that" then I'm willing to endure, so I'm not taking that into account for this rating.

Updated 12/2010:  Played the competitve game.  There is indeed too much take-that for me, but the game approaches strategic when playing competitively.  I think to the extent I'm willing to play this game in the future it will be the competitive version.  I don't see a reason not to play Arkham Horror instead of the coop of this game.

Uprating from 5 to 6.

RATING: 7.5
Preliminary rating based on just a couple of plays. This game oozes theme, has more game to it than Betrayal at House on the Hill, and it's quicker and easier to get to the table than Arkham Horror. All in all, seems to fit a needed nitch in my collection.

I've only played coop so far, and it seems a bit too easy.  I'll have to try competitive sometime to see if my rating goes up.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy the time frame. The theme is great, find an evil presence in or around the town. Gather weapons, items and clues to find the villian. Interview town leaders, even bring them into the final battle. The pieces are heavy duty, quality and eye pleasing. Can be played solo. Almost a mini Arkham Horror feel. Flying Frog standards are beyond all other compnaies.

--original comment--Easily the most eye popping game I have. Before I had finished my first play I had already committed myself to any and all expansions. I love the time period, the theme is well done and it runs smoothly. Buy it, so I can get the company to make more high quality games.

RATING: 7
Random cards, random dice rolls, random supporting
characters. All balanced by the fact that when
you die, you don't really die, you just pay
money to get resurrected. Somehow this passes for
'fun'.
At least this is shorter than "Munchkin Quest"
or "Arkham Horror".

Flying Frog expands to other non-zombie horror genres and does so successfully: a small village is plagued by something evil and you (competitively or cooperatively) must stop it, arming yourself along the way through smaller challenges. Success checks make the game exciting and the increased difficulty for cooperative play works. What doesn't work (and doesn't get it a full 10) is that some villains aren't as hard as others, and some players feel down time during the proceedings.

BIG PLUS: theme, original mechanics, effective challenging, quality of production
MINUS: uneven villains, minor down times for players

One play in...  not my cup of tea.  The mechanics feel dated and the photo art is, well,... ummm... ugly.  There, I said it.  

A shame, because I do like the notion of the game, as well as the location-specific decks.  All in all, though, this doesn't need another play from me.

Great game.  A lighter Arkham Horror that does the theme better. How so?  Each big baddie you go after has minions roaming the board that compliment them, unlike AH.  It is also streamlined/simpler, making for an easier/shorter game.  People complain about less decision making, which may be true, but I got too many headaches trying to play AH correctly.  If you liked Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, you will like this game.

This was my first Flying Frog game play and I really enjoyed my first play.  I like the variety and abilities of the different heroes and enjoy the diverse card decks for each location.  The game length is just right and allows you to power up you hero before going against the bad guy.  The various bad guys and special events that come with them also keep the game interesting.  The board is not my favorite but it doesn't detract from the game.

RATING: 8
Rated after a few plays.    It's good.  Quite good at accomplishing a similar enough feel to Arkham Horror...but with a much shorter play length, and less complexity/volume of rules. The "feel" of the game is cool, too.
That being said, it doesn't replace Arkham, the true master in this field/genre.
I do like it a lot, however, and look forward to seeing where add-ons may take it...

Upped the rating a tad recently.  It is a lot of fun; great feel/theme and has relatively fast play-time.

Personally I like it better as a competative game, but the co-op works really well.
I am eager to try out the "teams" official variant, with 6 players.
That sounds very cool!

I thought this was going to be a poor man's Arkham Horror, but I ended up really liking it. My only complaint is that the theme is kind of tacked on. I wish it were more like Arkham in that every single card had some kind of flavor text that helped draw you into the theme.

Roll the dice, take a card, roll the dice, take a card etc... not very fun. But the game does look really good.

RATING: 6
I think this game could be comparable to Arkham Horror, this is why I will make a lot of comparison in this comment. Many people said it was a combination of AH and talisman.

A touch of evil is a more simple arkham horror. Some simplified elements are more interesting than AH. For example, characters does not have variable stats which removes something to think about.

There is also only 4 locations to explore bu the exploration decks contains item cards which can be kept by player so no need to search through item deck to get equipments on events.

There is the elder investigation mechanic which is also nice. It adds a bit of "clue" to the game.

The components of the game are good in quality of the material and artwork (which are actually pictures).

Now the game is not perfect and lots of improvement could be done.

First, the board layout is bad and combined with the fact that you roll a die to move it's even worst. The board has a shape of 8. So you always need to go back to the middle of the board to reach the other side. Also not all squares you can land on are useful, so a bad die roll you lead you no where. I prever the AH board because it's easier to move from locations to location and in 2 turns, you can probably cross the whole board.

Another thing is that there is no much creatures and investigation tokens to pick on the board. I would have made sure that almost everymystery card would add tokens on the board. 

There is also the problem that monsters does not prevent players to move through them. So if a monters does not occupy a location with an event, players would simply ignore it, unless it want to fight it for tokens.

I also don't like the fact that investigation tokens also act as money. I would have preferred two separate resources.

So in overall there are some improvement, but the game is missing a lot to actually replace AH. Since I already own AH, I won't get this one.

This game is just fun.  Very random, but with a little strategy.  No stress if you play co-op.  The villains and heroes are fun and different.  The stores and encounters are fun and have fun items.  Just a fun non-stress game.  The sountrack is pretty good too!

This is a theme-heavy, luck-dependent, horror co-op game.

A Touch of Evil is kind of a weird coop/competitive mix.  It's also pretty fiddly to set up and takes up a lot more space than you would expect considering the small board.  It felt somewhat similar to [thing=8170][/thing]---you each control a character that travels around the board and battles monsters to gain items and experience.  The first player to become strong enough to defeat the Evil One is the winner.  However, [thing=35815]A Touch of Evil[/thing] didn't do it for us---in [thing=8170][/thing], you have quests that take you across the board and give you some direction.  In [thing=35815]A Touch of Evil[/thing], most of the fights are just one-offs.  For a thematic game, it didn't actually feel that thematic or interesting.  It really didn't give us the feeling of adventuring---we ended up just going to the same locations repeatedly to get items, stopping back at home to heal.  And once we got some items, the fights became a chore of looking up all of your modifiers after each dice roll, which really broke up the gameplay.  We had to interrupt the gameplay over and over again to check cards and events---it's here that I suspect that the game might be better with more players.  Drawing an event card after every two turns feels repetitive and even boring, since many of the events feel similar.  

Still, the components are nice and the music soundtrack was a nice touch, but this wasn't the thematic game for us.  Maybe these types of games go over better with more players...

This game feels mechanically very much like Arkham Horror Lite. It's possibly a little too long for its own good, but then I only have our first game (which will of course be slow) and a game with 8 players to judge by. Kudos, though, for allowing up to 8.

RATING: 7.5
A fun, thematic game that plays easily and relatively quickly. The setting is top notch, and the production quality is high. My major quibble is that the game is too complicated to teach quickly (in contrast to Betrayal), but not complicated enough to be massively strategic (a Euro) or ridiculously high content (Arkham Horror).

edit: Rating increased over repeated plays. Play the game more quickly and it's a great time, but if the players start dragging their feet the game will bog down.

RATING: N/A
First Impression:

Before reading the rules I thought this might be one of those games where the rulebook would be a slog. However, I was happily surprised, and I guess considering it's an older game from FFP, I should have realized that it was a fairly straight forward, light, thematic game.

I was up and running quickly and played 2 solo games back to back. One with just the base game against one of my favourite classical movie monsters, the Werewolf, and the second game with the Something Wicked expansion included against the Spectral Horseman.

I found the base game's map to be too small. It was easy enough to move around and I was able to gather quite a few Event cards and Items. My trio of heroes got powerful quick and beat the Villain in the first Showdown. Overall, I was a little disappointed with the difficulty level. Not overly so to make it a great concern after one play but I don't like to win on a first play. I used the Advanced Rules and Advanced Co-op Chart from Something Wicked. The only thing I didn't use was the optional Showdown Chart (I simply forgot) and the Growing Darkness variant.

So for my second game, again with a randomly selected trio of heroes I added the Something Wicked map and the Growing Darkness variant. This game ended up being one of those where anytime I started to make any progress gathering some equipment and Event cards I would get knocked out. The Advanced Co-op Chart was especially unforgiving, providing two surprise Showdowns, with the second KOing all my heroes. At one point, with the Growing Darkness variant in play, all the Minions were on the board and the Darkness track quickly jumped up. Three Elder were killed and two became evil so everything was conspiring against me. I enjoyed this game much more even if I lost badly!

The board seemed much more interesting with the added map and I liked the extra difficulty variants. One of my queries is whether there's any great incentive to searching out specific corner locations. Other than investigation tokens on them or sometimes being the only place you can reach, I don't see the reason to move around much. In this second play, I barely made it onto the Something Wicked map, maybe because they were always getting knocked out or because the minions ended up on that side often. Something to investigate in my next plays.

One thing I think the game is missing is with the Mystery cards. In both my plays, these cards provided obstacles and generally bad things happened but I didn't feel it brought the world alive like the Mythos cards in Arkham Horror bring Arkham alive. Maybe they're still in the deck for me to discover, but it would have been great to have things like "A lynch mob gathers at the Town Hall and marches to the Abandoned Keep. Any heroes the mob crosses must move with them along the path to the Abandoned Keep. Remove any minions they cross on a 4+ fight roll", etc. 

Overall, I enjoyed the game. I'll need to play it a few more times to understand if it has staying power. I know it doesn't dethrone Arkham Horror in my collection. I still find AH to be a far superior horror exploration, monster fighting game that will never leave my collection. With aToE, I like the classic monsters and am interested in exploring them in further plays.

Played this coop for the first time and got a lot of rules wrong...lost horribly!  It was very fun despite the loss and I am eager to give it another go now that issues have been clarified.
Finally played this one again and we won!  Definately more fun when you get the rules right.

RATING: 5
You are attempting to thwart evil from taking over an American colonial town in the 18th century.  You move around the board to various locations to gain items to help you in that fight and fight minor monsters and prepare for the "big bad".

I find the game somewhat boring as it seems a bit repetitive and overstays its welcome.  I tend to not like most Flying Frog games and am not keen on zombies.  

A little too heavy for families although teenagers might like it.

I describe this as Arkham Horror meets Runebound, but not quite as good as either one.  It's got the same kind of turn construction as AH, but it's more about building a powerful character than anything else.  The game-play can kind of drag on in this game, and the dice-rolling becomes pretty tedious, but the setting, theme and art-style of the game keeps me coming back for more.  A great game to pull out around Halloween.

I also own "Something Wicked" expansion, but it's not really a must-have.

I've heard people compare this to Arkham Horror and I see mechanical similarities but this one is definitely much lighter.

I think this game really benefits if you narrate it as you play - create a story to match what's going on. This is probably because mechanically it's a tad repetitive.

I'm rating this a 7 for the time being...

You have so little to do as a player the game is mind numbingly boring.

I love games filled with theme, especially if they are in the fantasy genre, mystery solving or those in the settings of 'Sleepy Hollow'. 'A Touch of Evil' fills up all 3 areas, and is filled with theme. Even the map looks amazing (mimics an old hand-drawn map). Even though it says you can play competitively, the game is best suited for co-operative gamplay with players who are into that kind of theme. You will also have to tweak the last boss' stats with more players. Otherwise, he is too easy to be beaten, making the climax rather anti-climatic. I believe this game shines when played solo or with a partner.

This game is just fun! Imagine the movies Van Helsing and Sleepy Hollow being combined and made into a boardgame! This game has players take on the roles of eccentric monster hunters trying to eradicate loads of supernatural minions in an attempt to locate the lair of and destroy the evil Monster Boss; all located in and around the community of a sleepy New England Town, complete with a cabal of town elders helping/hindering players. Sounds cool, right? Well, it is!
I've played with basic and advanced rules; as cooperative, competitive and team competitive and had a great time EVERY time I play it. In this game, theme STRONGLY outweighs strategy. So, if you're looking for a Puerto Rico-like game where you have a strategy going into the game and and will crush all players who are foolish (albeit, naive) enough to let you have your way throughout the game, and consequently get their behinds handed to them after you've finished kicking it... This game is NOT for you. However, if you are looking for an unpredictable, "dripping with theme" game with lots of player interaction and amazing game components, then check this one out! My rating = 7.6: good game, great components and theme, usually willing to play, but I realize this type of game is not for everyone and it can run a little longer than I generally like.

Thanks to tenmaya for trading this at the BGG.CON 2009 math trade.

This is rated after one solo play and several two-player cooperative plays. In one co-op game, it took two showdowns to defeat the big baddy, and all the town elders got killed before the second showdown. Others have resulted in very close games.

I find that this has moved up from a 6 to a 7 and now to an 8, because I still want to play it.

As a solo game, it grows on you. However, I can't say that I recommend all of the advanced rules: rolling to collect investigations makes it pretty hard. Maybe I was just a bit unlucky. 

Playing solo is a pretty good way to learn how the game works, though, and I got a good feel for the mechanics by doing so.

I grew fond of the small map, I like how the corner locations have different themes, I really like the town elders and how their secrets affect the game. This is very much an Arkham Horror lite, not so much in length but thematically and in number and complexity of fiddly rules. Also, it's an "experience" game, in that it can generate a fun narrative that you will talk about later. 

I love how thoughtfully it was set up for expansion. Just add a few cards and tokens, and voila! And with the small base game board, it was easy to add another with more locations on it. The publisher did not disappoint: Something Wicked and Hero Pack 1 were well worth it for me.

This is an easy game to teach, as well, which is great. Many of the "experience" games are difficult to explain due to their fiddliness. Not so with AToE.

I saw a recent thread in which someone wanted to make this one more Euroish. To which I say: "Holy fish sticks, Batman! Are you mental?" This is near-perfect the way it is, and the last thing any sane person should do to this is make it some resource management math puzzle with worker placement and set collection. There are 10 million boring Euros that you can't tell apart because they are the same game with identically meaningless, pointless, unthematic themes. Go play one of those and pretend it's fun. Leave this one alone.

With a little care, the large expansion and the hero pack will all fit into the base game's box. Barely.

This game continues to get better with each play, and I recommend it highly.

I've come to notice that I don't seem to like this company's games; this LNoE, and Fortune and Glory, while I have yet to play, after seeing it...

Anyway, about this game: much like LNoE, I dislike the art; I really don't care for real people photographed to be the art of a game, or at least the way they do it. I ASSUME they're going for a B movie feeling with that, but even if that's it, I don't appreciate it. 
The CD the game comes with, I feel in a similar manner: it is cool and innovative as a concept, but it doesn't add so much at the experience, they music needed to be better (again, unless they were going for the B movie ambientation...).

The game can be played both as a competitive game and as a co-op, but the former is much more fun... and even in that way it doesn't shine (at least for me). It has some cool cards you can play to screw others, but all in all it feels long and sort of generic.

One play so far, an eight player Team play.  Some fuzzy rules when it comes to ironing out the details of meshing the coop vs. competitive for team use.  Overall though, not bad.  I could see where a 2-4 player competitive game would be appealing especially if it clocked in under 90 minutes.  Still, both LNoE and Arkham Horror are superior games so I'm not sure if this will hold its spot in my collection.

Flying frogs seem to hit the theme nail smack bang on the head. You can't fail to get drawn into such a well crafted world. Granted, It's cheese (hammer meets burton) but damn tasty cheese. We have always have fun playing touch of evil. Don't take it to seriously as it's gameplay is pretty run of the mill but it's theme and the story which is made by the players as they poke their nose around shadowbrook really make up for it. Very good family/light hearted gaming group game.

Like all Flying Frog products this one has great production values. However, the actual gameplay (we played with the werewolf) just did not excite any of the six players. Those who had tried it agreed that it lacked the tension of Last Night on Earth.

Would only play again under some form of duress or if it could be demonstrated that my initial play of this was atypical. The CD was fine though and quite evocative of the genre.

A real shame as the theme is fun.

No play after a year and no real desire to play either.

RATING: 6
A strong theme with relatively simple play makes for a good game.

Although aToE has a few game concepts that are similar to those of Arkham Horror, the two are different enough in their own rights to not be compared to each other. 

However, the coop game seems a little too easy and isn't clear on one or two points. The competitive and coop competitive game styles seem to be the ways that aToE should be played. This game is also far too long- 2-3 hours for 3 players?! This game is not deep enough to merit the kind of time it takes to play. The darkness track just doesn't progress enough!

Sadly this games rules for coop and coop team play just don't meld properly with the rules, leading to up hill struggles, unfair scenarios and generally broken play. 

Regardless of how much I thought about playing it (and still think about it) and how fun I imagined it would be the reality just never matched the idea.

Loved the Sleepy Hollow theme.

Has a generic "roll, move & draw card" mechanic which can get boring quickly. Strategy is always the same -- buff up quickly (& earlier than opponents in non-coop games) to beat the big bad. Nice milieu.

Our new October (Halloween) tradition.  I picked up this game on a trade, and after having it sit for months on the shelf, I finally set the game up, read the rules, and started playing a solo co-op game using two heroes.  My 8-year old daughter checked it out and I asked her if she wanted to play one turn to check it out.  One turn led to another and the next thing I know, she was in the game!  We had a great time and it got us in the Halloween spirit (we played this on 10/24/10) as we battled the headless horseman and his minions. We plan to play it again this week and I hope to bring my wife into it.  Now I'm in the mood to see Sleepy Hollow.  Great theme, and a fun spooky time!

RATING: 3
Ugh, this was bad. In many ways, it feels like Flying Frog's attempt to create a less fiddly version of Arkham Horror. The problem is, the game doesn't really give you any direction. You roll a die, move around the board, encounter whatever you encounter, and EVENTUALLY you'll be able to challenge the Big Bad. In AH, you always know what the objective is going to be, and how to accomplish it. With A Touch of Evil, you know what the objective is, but you don't know if or when you'll get the cards needed to complete it. That's the one thing keeping A Touch of Evil from being a good game.

Have only played the cooperative version.
Arkham Horror light.  We even call the investigation tokens clue tokens instead.  The games seem to swing wildly from "wow this is way too easy how can you ever loose" to "wow I feel screwed, how can you ever win" with really nothing in between.  I generally don't mind randomness, but there might actually be a bit too much in this game.

This game is soooo awesome.  An elegantly re-themed and simplified Arkham Horror that plays easily and brilliantly either cooperatively or competitively.  I'm glad that it brought my attention to this theme and would love to see what FFP could do with a fantasy themed game with similar design choices.

Really put FFP on the radar for me, highly recommend this to anyone, it always tells a really fun story too.  Recommended with ALL expansions.

I played this game four times: a two-person and six-person game at GenCon, and a two-person and three-person game at home.  I never could quite get over the feeling that is a re-themed, drier, and simplified version of of Arkham Horror.  I'd have no problem with the first and third adjectives.  It's the middle adjective - "drier" - that's the big problem.  There's just not much tension.  Roll, draw card, collect tokens.  The six-person game took way too long, and there is considerable down time while others are moving about, so that my daughters (in the home games) were bored.  Happily traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Less luck heavy then it feels at first; lots of atmosphere (sound track and lovely components and flavor text help), lots of room for role play, great feel of tension until the end, great feel of mystery (even if actual mysteries to solve are fairly limited), works both competitively and cooperatively, has a great feel of climax--which I think is important for any board game especially a themed one, feels stream-lined and fast paced.

A game that I know is good because rather than getting bored with it, I appreciate it more and more, the more I play.

This game gets a huge bonus because of it's fun factor, roleplay element, streamlined mechanics, and fast/urgent gameplay. There's actually nothing that brilliant or excitingly new about it's mechanics alone.

I admire Arkham for it's mechanics, depth, and components but feel that this game is perhaps more involved in theme because of it's high quality fluff and components and cinematic feel. Arkham is great but can be fiddly and sometimes convoluted because of the many winning and losing conditions many of which don't have an easy reference or tracker for. Furthermore, Touch of Evil almost ALWAYS ends in a showdown with the villian which you either all lose or all win (at least in cooperative) which is far more thrilling of a conclusion than say Arkam where the showdown is what your trying to avoid and the more ideal and sometimes more often ending is closing enough games. Closing the gates in time seems like it can be exciting but it's less of a thrilling and climactic ending which I think is an underrated asset which more games should aspire to be like Touch of Evil and employ as an essential element. A game that ends in an epic conclusion is more interesting than a game that slowly fizzles out with it becoming increasingly obvious that one or more players has definitely LOST and your just in that long trudge till that happens and when it doesn happen it's not even exciting--regular player elimination games such as classic Risk come to mind. Touch of evil is awesome and does the opposite of this.

Some call it a 'lite' version of Arkham Horror, but I disagree.  It shares a similar feel but plays much faster and is more accessible than most Cthulhu-based games.

Great campy fun, in teams or on your own!

Hey guys, 'Arkham Horror' is really fun, but the rules are a mess and it takes forever to play. Lets make an 'Arkham Horror Lite', and replace the Mythos with classic horror monsters.

It worked!

Only played one game so far, which was 7 player co-op.  Based on that particular game I'd say this takes a bit too long for what it is and when playing co-op there doesn't seem to be much chance of the game beating you.

I could imagine this would be better playing competetively and with less players.

The models are great and I'd be tempted to get the game just for them.  I also like the theme and the atmosphere of the game.  I'd play it again to give it another chance.

After one play I found it quite difficult to grasp with rules not being as clear as they might have been, plus there seamed to be a lot of cards in play at once, too many to a) have room for on the table b) keep a track of. For the money I expected a hell of a lot better. Hopefully I'll be adjusting the rating after a couple more plays.
After the second play, which i found a hell of a lot better, I've upped the rating to 6 and maybe when I play the advanced game it will be more...
3 plays down, with the last being a very good 5 player game I have to up the rating to 7 1/2.
Updated rating again after two more interesting plays, one involving just me and the board

I like this game! My wife is a serious Arkham Horror player...AH is one of her favorite games! With a little trepidation we purchased this one thinking it would be too similar to AH! But it was all good...she loves this one too. It is unique in its own right! The mood is different and the mechanics are unique enough to support a new game experience...that's what counts! This is definitely Tim Burton's movie, Sleepy Hollow in the form of a game! The town elder mechanic is the best part...they each are either good or evil...may help you or fight against you! The evil characters are very Halloween (Vampire, Werewolf, Scarecrow, and Headless Horseman)! Replace AH, never...but, I'm sure that wasn't the designers intention anyway! I appreciate this game most for its thematic mood, monster choices, and elders!

Talisman in another guise. Roll die. Move. Land on a space. Pick up a card. Hopefully have it be an item which adds to your stats (which indicate how many dice to roll, 5+ are successes). Lots of event cards get triggered which you generally roll dice to resolve. Improve your stats enough to kill the big guy and win the game. The cards were great but the monotone sepia board was boring and non-atmospheric to play on. Turns went relatively fast making the game a non-painful thematic ride, but there are not many decisions along the way and there's little player interaction. Stat accumulation and die rolling is an 80's game, revised with a 00's artsy makeover.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played once and it had a nice atmosphere but its waaaay too random.  Roll a die & draw a random card... over and over and over.

Also, I don't see how the villain can possibly win which takes a lot of the fun out of it for me.  Our friend who brought the game has played dozens of times and said we were the worst group he'd ever seen.  The villain had every possible power-up and we had virtually nothing.  Yet, the first player to fight the villain destroyed him.  The 3 hours we spent walking around trying to power-up were completely unnecessary. It would be better if it were shorter.

I recently purchased this game and have to say that I love it!! I love horror and also love suspense. A Touch of Evil is tremendous fun and is scary as well! The story and characters are very well developed. The board is well done and the pieces are great as well. 
I've purchased all of the add-ons and enjoy them as well. It's also great that you can create your own villains to add to the game as well. Great Job Flying Frog!!

RATING: 6
Based on one play: One of those games where you simply move around and draw cards hoping to get good items for the end game, which is the big battle against the boss. The expansions add new locations, but not really any new game play. Given this, the game is still fun as you work together to time your attack and laugh when bad things happen to your teammates. A little long at times if you keep dying, which will happen often. But if you like the co-op play and theme, it is worth a try.

Love it.

I can't get enough of this game, and yes I realize that will probably burn out after time, but I'm very much looking forward to the new incarnation of the game (Dark Gothic).

I love the theme. THe characters are fun to play.  the villians provide a unique feel and each villian is original with new minions fighting for them and powers that apply to just that villian.

The art on both the cards and the board is nice, the board gives the game a very 1800s feel and flying frog's art is always very appealing in my book.

This game is a space HOG especially when adding in expansions.  Wouldn't hurt from a little more difficulty.

One of my favorite games. 10 based on art, quality, replayability, theme, fun, and originalanity.

Gothic Horror game in which the players take the part of Heroes, gathering items and investigation, braving minions and trying to defeat one of the villians trying to plunge the village of Shadowbrook into darkness. The range of Heros, Villains, minions, adventure cards and expansions make this a game with a huge numnber of variations, and variant ruleas add even more, allowing cooperative or competative play and increasing the game's difficulty as you please.

In A Touch of Evil, players take on the role of investigators who are attempting to find the location of and defeat a big bad monster.  The players can travel along the map board to various locations to improve their stats, gain items, and earn investigation tokens, the currency of the game.  Along the way, players can enlist the help of the town elders, each of whom has a secret--they may help you against the villain, they may be secretly working for he villain, or they may have a completely irrelevant secret.  The game has both competitive and cooperative modes.  I've only played cooperatively, and in that mode it feels a lot like Arkham Horror--you don't really have much direction and it takes too long to do anything.  While the town elders seem like a nice twist, I didn't feel like they added very much.

This game gives me a nice balance between in depth monster hunting and relatively quick play time. The game comes with a simple but thematic board, nice pieces which paint up well and tons of cards and dice. It can be argued that the game is primarily based around dice chucking but so can most games and I find that it is that uncertainty that provides these games with their suspense and gripping terror factor.

I can easily imagine the Nosferatu (don't wake daddy style) vampire vanishing into a vaporous mist as you unload pistol after pistol into his direction or the werewolf striking hard and fast at your plucky band of hunters whilst they squabble between themselves over who has betrayed them.

More Hammer Horror than Horror at Red Hook but with so many characters, monsters, weapons and (now)3 beautiful maps - whose complaining?!

Update 7/15
Played my first game in a long while. Three characters against the sunken seven. The game had everything -  haunted inns, freak lightning storms and murdered officials. Almost reached the final showdown cornering the villain in his lair when a fluke mystery card ended the game by  moving the shadow marker two spaces. It was close but great fun! Can't recommend this game enough as long as you can add an expansion or two.

Arkham Horror super-lite.

Great game and with all the expansions a fun adventure.  The only thing I don't like are some of the interactions.  Some are really tough to handle if you want to win the game.  And I am not sure on the map board.  It is unique.  

But I really like the role playing aspects of the game, the adventure of it all.  One can easily get lost in the game and lose hours of fun play time.

Also, it can be played cooperatively, competition against other players, and solo.  Lots of replay value.

Fun little game with several modes of play. I am interested to try it again in a non full co-op mode. I like that the game gives you some time to move around and collect items/build your characters in some relative peace first.

My only complaint with A Touch of Evil is the obnoxiously low difficulty in the co-op variant. We've implemented the house rule restricting players to only keeping one Event Card in hand at a time. If a new one is drawn, choose which one to keep. You can't play the discarded card. You may, however, play the card before you see what you draw.

The variant has helped quite a bit, but we still haven't felt any threat of danger while playing.

RATING: 3.5
I think Last Night on Earth and Invasion from Outer Space are good games and their simple and fast playing style suits them well. Lots of dice rolling, movement (grid system), lots of card-plays, light skirmish gaming. A Touch of Evil however walks down a different path and it does not work in my opinion. The game is essentially a very thematic (ameritrash) game but there is not enough theme in it too make it work. If you compare this to Arkham Horror, it feels like going to a country fair when you could go to Disneyland. The rules are fiddly and inelegant, sometimes nothing exciting happens and there is no atmosphere at all. Disappointing.

RATING: 9
I love the Flying Frog games but this one is probably the best for one reason: it can be played co-operative with 2 players or more. I love Last Night on Earth but you need someone to run the rotters.

The combination of the monster hunt, learning the secrets of the town elders and look of the board, pieces and various cards makes this game a win.

RATING: 9
This is more than just "Arkham Horror"-lite.  Oh, there are many mechanistic similarities to Arkham Horror, no doubt.  And if you like AH, you will most likely like Touch of Evil.  However, Touch of Evil immerses you in a completely different world and "feels" different from AH.  Similar to Flying Frog's Last Night on Earth, there is a complete cast of live-action characters, coupled with kitschy poses.  I happen to like this, and think it is one of the aspects of the game that sets it apart from other games which use illustrations.  Although the characters are a bit stereotypical, you still get the feeling that they are somehow real, thus enhancing the theme. Say what you want about the vampire, though.

Another plus of being AH-like, but AH-lite, is that the game plays quicker as you don't get bogged down in the complexity of the rules.  This also makes Touch of Evil more accessible to non-gamers, always a plus in my book. I actually like playing this with non-gamers, as I feel that they can grasp the gameplay in a really quick time AND it's a fun theme for them to immerse themselves in.  AH can just be so serious sometimes!

RATING: 7
I don't see why so many of these games have a great premise, and many solid mechanics, and then they throw away the possibility of having a great game by including overwhelmingly-unbalanced items and abilities into the mix.  If they just kept them somewhat similar to each other and didn't go over-the-top in their desperate desire to have EVERYthing in the game, the balance would be improved 3-fold.
Just remove a handful of abilities and items (the worst 10%) and this could be improved greatly.
As it is, the overly-dominating cards, abilities, and items make a mockery of planning, strategy, and/or tactics.
Too bad, too - great theme, fantastic components, and excellent game niche (lighter Arkham Horror) were really setting this game up to be a possible purchase.

RATING: 8
For fans of Flying Frog Press games, you'll find the level of artwork and parts quality to which you are accustomed.  For players of Arkham Horror, you will find a combat style and investigation mechanism that is familiar.  For players of Betrayal at the House on Haunted Hill or Last Night of Earth, you will find the a familiar type of Character Development and Inventory Management and augmentation.

It is a steep task to defeat the villain in the game, and one must gather a great deal of resources to stand a chance.  Further, they cannot sit back and wait to confront the villain.  We lost our first session because we could not stop the progression of the Danger track past the final spot, thus ending the game.  We severely failed on one confrontation with the Villain before that end of game condition occurred, and we were re-equipping our characters for another shot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another Flying Frog game with amazingly goofy box art.
The first thing that appeal to me is the theme, how many other games would use a supernatural post-colonial America as a setting. The only reference I know of is Sleepy Hollow, which is fine by me.
I love the game board which is atmospheric and detailed. The miniatures are some of the best I have ever seen:  the poses and proportions are spot on and the sculpts match the characters in the game art even down to there equipment.
Having played this a couple of times, still unsure about this one, might be better with a smaller group.Theres a good game in here if you get the player numbers and the rules right.
UPDATE I now have Arkham Horror to compare with this game, which obviously A touch of Evil borrows its system from (nothing wrong with that)
UPDATE a recent game at A FANG session has ignited my interest in this game, I just need to get my hands on the expansion now.

RATING: 6
Lo and behold, currently I like it more than "Arkham Horror". Maybe because it's streamlined and we can enjoy a game of adventure in about an hour? Plus, I just LOVE the theme, the atmosphere, the artistic design... I'd never expect to have so much fun in rolling dice, reading fluff and having my ass spanked for no good reason. Plus, playing against different villains really feels like a new game with different flavour and approach, something that AH couldn't achieve with the various goos. Makes the expansions so much more tempting.

Drawbacks? Because of the villain chart, monster chart and dozen other charts there are (too) many small rules one needs to remember. Granted, it all becomes a non issue after several games, but you're bond to make lots of tiny mistakes at the beginning (or if you don't play often). Fiddly in the style of old, fiddly ameritrash games.

UPDATE: Sold it. Enjoyed it while it lasted, but the shine wore off. Still, can recommend for people who enjoy fun - and very random! - adventure games.

A Touch of Evil... well, my feelings for this game have declined over the years. It isn't a [i]bad[/i] game, but with better choices for adventure games out there it isn't likely to see much time on the table. Probably the most striking thing about this is the artwork, or rather, the photography. The scenes on the cards, character art, and other aspects of the presentation are photographed rather than drawn. I understand this normal for Flying Frog Productions games, I personally don't care for it but it lends the game a unique, somewhat "aged" feel that is interesting. The actual theme is very compelling, it appears to be roughly the mid to late 18th century and it involves various supernatural mythological creatures terrorizing a small town. The game play however falls flat for me and ends up being a boring exercise in tedium. I think it would be great for a themed game night, but not as a staple. Interestingly, it comes with a sound track (I didn't care for it) and my copy is signed and came with what appears to be signed promotional photographs of a rather lovely looking woman who played one of the characters.

Although too long to be a "filler" game, my first game was a very enjoyable Arkham Horror-lite experience.  Playing competitively contributes well to the tension.  It suffers from special-rules-via-cards slowdown, much as the other Jason Hill game does (Last Night on Earth).  Will definitely be playing again, though.

Beautifull game that really captures the atmosphere of a horror movie. 

I gues not everyone likes the people in costumes approach, but I love it. It has that nice B-movie quality to it. 

As a big fan of classic movies, I can really say that Flying Frog games are great for anyone who loves movies. 

There is a lot of replayability going on with just the base game already, but with all expansions and card packs it pretty much becomes infinite. 

What I also really like about the game is that the available heroes offer a diverse cast of different characters of both genders and of many different backgrounds. There's something there for everyone to enjoy.

A neat game with a lot of theme. The game plays differently each time with different enemies to fight and new loyalties for the town elders. 

However, our group felt that the competitive version of the game didn't fit the theme very well and have only been playing cooperatively, which seems to be way too easy even when playing with the advanced enemy charts.

This is Arkham Horror light in many ways; a more light hearted theme, similar but more straight forward mechanics, much shorter play time. Until Eldritch Horror came out this was very much the recommendation for those who want a game like Arkham they could play if they had less free time. Now that question is not so much of an easy one but I think many people will like the lighter less heavy feel of this over those games.

Well worth picking up!

Played twice. It's fairly interesting, but after awhile it feels hollow. Like you're only going through the motions before winning. While the art and theme are great, the end game left me bored. The expansion is supposed to help remedy that. Also, this impression is based solely on co-op play.

As said:  Excellent theme.  The soundtrack is... meh..., but with or without it the theme is great and immersive.  I play this game solo with 3 characters and it's quite challenging.  This core game without expansion is still very, very fun.  If you're a horror fan, you can play this in July and make it seem like it's October. 

Gameplay is similar to other Flying Frog games.  You have a "darkness" track similar to Brimstone's other "darkness" track and you roll dice as your heroes have cards and such.

Looks great but falls short of the thrills encountered in LNOE. Some good ideas seemingly cut short in development, e.g. the town elders. Can drag on a tad and the playing time isn't matched by the depth of the design, instead you find yourself enduring rather than enjoying. The problems aren't serious enough to prevent me from playing it again, so I suppose that says something. Also, what is the deal with the imbecilic CD's enclosed with this company's output? - zero talent, vanity recording in action, UGGHH, now THAT'S scary.

I think this game is destined to become a 10.  I'll wait until I have a few more plays (and more expansions).  I'm really enjoying it though.  It hits the theme perfectly, and has a nice variety of play styles that better suit the different people I play with.  It also has the one feature I admire most in games:  it sparks creativity -- you can't play it without thinking of ideas for new characters, villains, cards, etc. 

Update: April 2011 -- yes, it's definitely a 10.  I love this game!

Update February 2013 -- still love it.  With the addition of The Coast and the second Hero Pack, I would give it an 11 or 12 if I could.

A Touch of Evil is a pretty simple game, about the same complexity as Talisman, but the players have more choices to make and secrets to investigate, and the game develops much more quickly. A turn consists of rolling a D6 to determine the max number of spaces you can choose to move, and then drawing a location card or an event card. Events and location interactions can be good or bad for the heroes, who might gain allies or useful items, or unleash nasty monsters that block movement until defeated. The players also collect a hand of cards that can be played at opportune moments to aid them and their allies, or help or hinder other players. Like Arkham Horror, the currency of the game are investigation tokens, which are used to buy items, heal wounds, increase a hero's stats, discover the villain's lair, and uncover the secrets of the Town Elders (NPCs). The secrets are dealt randomly at the start of the game and are unknown until investigated. Additional secrets can be added to Elders during the course of the game. The Elders can either be friendly allies or evil minions of the villain (i.e., vampire, werewolf, the scarecrow, or spectral horseman) that the heroes are trying to defeat.  ATOE can be played cooperatively, like Arkham Horror, or in a competitive mode where everyone is racing to be the first to defeat the villain in the climactic showdown.

I was really looking forward to this game. I thought it was a game I would love. But the game wasn't what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, but I think I hyped it up too much in my mind and it fell short. I was hoping for some giant build up till the end, but it never really did that. Fury of Dracula really did have that aspect to it. I prefer that game. I would try this game again.

Really awesome theme, evocative game with great 'artwork' (photography?). I really enjoy Flying Frog games, and this is the best of the bunch - with all the expansions, it's not quite as mad as Arkham Horror, and has just a touch more (obvious) strategy with the difficult/easy locations colour coded for your convienience.

By no means is this a strategic game - it's almost pure luck - but it's great fun. The gameplay itself is right up my street - a competative variation on Arkham Horror, set in a time period more intersting to me. 

The co-operative aspect is good, but I'd reccomend Arkham Horror if that's what you want, and play this game to compete.

RATING: 8.5
A Touch of Evil is a great game with an unfortunate name, as some will miss this gem of colonial gothic action investigation as your hero rescues the town of Shadowbrook from a menace.  The game is highly thematic, even to the degree that if players opt not to read the flavor text on the cards the experience will be diminished.  The game is more strategic than tactical as resolving conflicts usually involve rolling dice and counting 5s and 6s, and players spend most of their time moving around the board and having encounters in hopes of gaining clues, allies, or equipment to aid them in ridding the town of the Touch of Evil that is plaguing it.

During setup a villain will be chosen.  Each villain has its own set of minions and special abilities which alter some aspect of the game.  Each villain has a basic and advanced version of its stats allowing the players to decide how hard of a game they want to have.  Additionally the players can decide to play with the co-op rules, the team rules, or the competitive rules.  Players also get to choose which hero they are, each hero having different stats and different special abilities.  During setup the players will shuffle a deck of secrets and the deck of Town Elders.  Each Town Elder is dealt a secret, which is kept secret from the players until they spend their hard won clues to discover an Elder's secret.  The secrets range from being helpful in fighting the villain, harmful in the fight, to actually being in league with the villain.

Each round all of the players will get a turn, after which a mystery phase occurs in which the villain heals, KO's heroes revive,  a card from the Mystery deck is drawn and is resolved, usually to the detriment of the players, and the first player marker moves.  Each turn a player will roll a die to see how many spaces he can move on the board.  Should a player move into a space with one of the villain's minions in it he will stop and fight.  Finally players will take actions, in any order they wish, and as many as desired.  Actions include encountering the current space, which usually means drawing a card from one of several decks, healing, pay to look at an Elder's secret, uncover where the villain's lair is, and start a showdown with the villain.

Individual turns resolve quickly, resulting in a game with little down time once players are familiar with the rules.  Considering each player and each villain adjusts the rules, and that many of the cards in the game will impact how players will decide to play, the first few plays will take time; however, once slight learning curve is mastered the game flows smoothly.  Thematically it feels as if players are in the world of Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow; indeed the game even has a headless "Spectral Horseman."  Players are essentially building up an arsenal to take down the villain and become the hero of Shadowbrook.  The game is not a high strategy game, rather it is a game that will allow you and your fellow players to tell the story of how the town of Shadowbrook was rescued from A Touch of Evil.

A game set in Sleppy Ho.., I mean Shadowbrook, a small town with a lot of secrets, in which a terrible monster has been murdering people.  The art of the game is like the one in a terror B movie, and it even have a soundtrack.  It is an adventure game in which players wander around to get items, allies and skills in order to be strong enough to get the bad guy and save the town.  It has a very interesting use of investigation points, as kind of the money of the game, but players do get the feeling of finding clues in their encounters that lead them to precious information.

Co-operative and competitive game is quite fun (though 5 or less sounds like the right number... with more than that it can drag). Team competitive was a bit weak b/c of long game time/downtime.

Giving it an 8 because it is a solid game, but not quite as good as LNOE or Arkham Horror. (the two games I have no choice but to compare it to)

EDIT: Downgrading to a 7 due to playing it a bit less than I thought I would.

RATING: 6.9
To be honest I wanted to really like the core game, it has all the elements that I love about board games.

- Quality Components
- Interesting and somewhat Complex Mechanics
- Customizable Characters
- Large amount of event-esque cards that create a dynamic story/replayability
- Co-Op + Competitive Variances
- It's own music to create Theme!

Truth be told, it's these and the dev's attention to their game that gave it the score it did. Despite all of those being said there is just one thing that this game lacks, and recently I just played it with a group of 4 friends in a co-operative and competitive play and just found the game lacking in fun-factor.

Why?

To be honest, it probably has to do with game immersion and content. Though it came with a CD for some reason, it feels like you just hashed up a quick scenario and threw your character in the fray. The villain, and even the elders for some strange reason just don't compelling to defeat, investigate, or even care if they live or die. The fight mechanics are pretty simple come to think of it, there are not many keywords, it's pretty straight-forward. You roll dice, successes are 5, and 6's with silvershot being the only caveat, and that's about it.

The advanced game does add depth but still I find somehow the content to be extremely lacking. Not sure why because I really want to like this game but for some reason, whenever I play this game with new friends none of them want to play it. Then, as I continue teaching the game and playing the game feels more of a chore.

Perhaps an expansion of this game would enlighten my review, but as is the game sits at the top of the 6 rating. "Usually willing to play."

One of those rare games in which both coop and competitive play are equivalent partners, as opposed to one of them being "tacked on" after the fact and not really fitting the game.

2013's worse gaming experience by far. Because I played it 3 times (+ solo). My rating started at 6 and dropped to 2 (as I'm a nice guy), but I never want to see this heap of rubbish again. I'm calm, I'm calm. 
Note: I only played the competitive version, never co-op.

It started okay. There was this thematic game in the club's closet. The board really looks nice even if everything else is done in entirely different graphical style. I took it out, soloed it, it seemed okay. 

Then we played it once, okayish. Kinda, sorta like Muchkin (each person on it's own, take that cards) meets Arkham Horror (pick clues, kill monster). Next week a friend and my GF wanted to play again, I was immediately horrified. I had other plans. I suddenly realised how the game drags and how little control you have over both game state AND the narrative. 

Then a week or two later at the Saturday event I run at the club newcomers looked at our gaming closet with big hungry eyes (as they do) and somehow AtoE came up:
[i]"what's this game"
"it's crap"
"no, really, it looks so awesome"
"it's terrible"
(someone opens the box)
"oooooo!"
"sigh. Fine, I'll teach you the rules, but I won't play it, ok?"
"That wouldn't be fair. I mean, probably we could play something else, uhm, uhm, but this one looks so coooool!"[/i]
Told you I'm a nice guy and let myself be drawn into this. And it was a 5 or 6 player game. 

It was horrendous. At least half way in the game I noticed some other players were also looking at the ceiling.
[i]"I told you!"[/i]
Then another player comes along, he was doing some work in another room. 
[i]"hey, you want to take my character?"
"I'm fine, thanks"
"I can give you mine"
"Really I'm fine"
"You can play mine"
"I already turned down two offers!"[/i]
At least that pushed everybody to play quicker and with cooperation and group effort we somehow finished it. And I hope that's the last time I ever saw that box open. 

But what's the problem? 
Well it goes like this: you don't play AtoE, AtoE plays you!. For 95% of the time there's no interaction, you just run around by the implementation of clever roll and move mechanism (at least they made so that rolling 1 gives you a benefit) and you are basically just piling items and cards for the final part. Interaction is zero. Narrative is totally driven by the game. All decisions are made by the cards themselves. You roll some dice, you draw some cards and that the level of theme in this game. And then there's finally the final fight and you realise take that cards are pretty weak (compared to Munchkin). So uhm. Terrible. There's too much downtime. Actually the whole game is basically downtime. Only those 2-3 minutes of the final fight there's actually something going on. 

EDIT: I played this 4 times - I sorta liked it on the first solo run, was kinda bored the second time (with people), was shocked there was a third time, while the fourth time is my #1 worst boardgaming experience. 
I was far too generous giving this heap of garbage a 2.0

This game has great family entertainment value as even my wife (who doesn't generally play board games) had a lot of fun. It is simple enough to keep people involved but difficult enough to keep it interesting!

RATING: 6
This isn'r Arkham Horror-lite (only in theme) but rather a Talisman-derivative. Players can play competitively or co-op: they walk around a town in order to gain investigation points, items, etc in order to tool up for a smackdown against one of four villians.

It's a simple enough game and turns move at a quick pace. However, I'm not sure if it's all that engaging for me to want to replay it over again. There isn't that 'fun factor' LNoE had. And the difficulty (even on advanced) doesn't seem quite right.

Конечно, игра является младшим братом Аркхема Хоррора, но не без своих прелестей, главной, из которых может быть "облегченность" в основных "аркхемовских" механиках. Интересны решения, отличающие её от АХ - Городские Старейшины и особенности "доигрывания" Решающей Схватки, с постепенным восстановлением главного Злодея, которого можно ещё "добить" на следующих ходах. Нокаут, всё таки не так болезненен, как Смерть в Аркхеме. Однако минусы очевидны. Так как игра, по умолчанию предназначена для Конкурентного варианта, в Кооперативном - Злодею не хватает "пороха". Слишком легко накручиваются Герои, из-за того, что в колодах Локаций, в отличии от Аркхема, преимущественно хорошие карты. Да и События сплошь положительные (выполняют скорее функцию Заклинаний в Аркхеме). Но всё же своя прелесть в атмосфере игры есть! С дополнениями игра становится ещё интересней!

RATING: 7.5
This is a good game.   One flaw is that the characters accumulate "Mystery" cards that alter game rules and there are just too many of them that accrue over time.  I don't like having to read a long list of rules exceptions with every game turn.  I mean, it's one thing to keep track of a stack of "items" your character is carrying, but keeping track of all the different ways your character must modify some rule is too taxing. Some kind of more elegant mechanic needs to be developed.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun game a bit reminiscent of Arkham Horror where the players can (in the version we played) work together to destroy an evil force threatening the town of Shadowbrook. I liked the theme of the villian making each play feel unique (minions of the villian matching the Villian, etc.) and the components have that awesome B-Movie photographic look to them (like Last Night on Earth). More than once an event or some text gave us a good laugh. Long play session the first time though as we may have overbuilt our characters and was uncertain when it was time to challenge the Villian.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The experience is okay.  I think that the co-op game is much better than the competitive game (and makes more thematic sense).  But what it comes down to is that there isn't many decisions to make, and the big decision of the game (when to fight the bad guy) can be reached in awkward or strange conditions.  Most of the game consists of rolling a die, pulling a card, rolling a die, pulling a card, and it gets a bit monotonous even with the theme there.  I DO really like the mechanic with the town elders being friend or foe and having to peek at that information.  I just wish the game was more streamlined overall.

Got this to the table for first time last night. Tentative rating of 8 because we all had a good time.

Have yet to play a competitive game, but I'm thinking with our group, we need to play teams, not straight competitive.

*RE-EDIT* This one is still a favorite, and we still have to stick with co-op. That's not a bad thing.

Thematic game that really shines in co op. The emergent storytelling from the encounter and mystery decks is really cool. Every game is basically a gothic horror story generator.

RATING: 5.5
A fairly light (in terms of mood, not mechanics; the rules are a bit fiddly the first couple times) competitive game that feels like a cross between Talisman/Runebound and Cutthroat Caverns, with flavor text and a mechanic or two stolen from Arkham and pretty much all its style and layout lifted straight from Last Night on Earth.  Nothing earth-moving, but a fun race to kill the monster sort of game.

Co-op does not work very well; it lacks the tenseness needed to really make for a good challenge, even with the Epic Showdown chart.

Surprisingly enough, though, the game actually works quite well solo, with a single investigator.    When the Mystery phase is every round, there's enough bite from the game to make it a close call.  Plus you can play it in about a half hour solo!

Sleepy Hollow comes to life. The Town Elders and the use of secrets is an inspired mechanic.
Each of the the four Villains plays very differntly. 

Use the advanced version and tweak a house rule or two for a rivetting game.

10 for components.

Cons: movement controlled by the luck of the die. 
Very little benefit in leaving town as spirit and cunning can be upgraded in the town itself. The 4 corner locations are much of the same so there was a missed opportunity to to make tactical or strategic choices about where to go

First play - 4 players, 3 hours. Villain - Scarecrow.   My impressions : RPG style goodness, definitely a casual, theme-filled game of dice rolling fun.  

Second play - 2 players, 1:15.  Villain - Horseman.  Much better with more players but the difficulty increased with 2.  We won but just barely.

3rd play - 3 players, 2 hours. Villain - Horseman.  We were tired.  Got impatient for the showdown.  A win with 2 heroes going down in the fight.  The horseman did not put enough baddies on the map for us to level up.  Oh, and the Vampire is an ass kicker.

2p, 1ish hour. - Werewolf.  Hardest villain yet due to the curse ability and extra attack dice.  This game we played competitively and didn't really notice a difference other than I won by cleaning up the mess from my wife after she did a whole lot of damage.  We will play coop from now on. 

I just like this game even though it can be fiddly as hell.  We skip rules and such when it gets annoying just to get the game moving.

6p, 2:45 - Scarecrow.  This game just has appeal.  It seems to be the best choice for large groups.  It can drag near the end but I speed things along to the showdown.  Everyone always seems to like it.  I suppose it's just the ease of play.  Well, with me doing all the heavy lifting of the game flow.  I don't mind. 

Final Review : Fun with a group especially if one person (me) keeps it moving along.  Take shortcuts and disregard stuff to keep it fun.  With 2 player it's not fun.

Fun factor : :star::star::star::star::nostar:

First play through was coop and we got a couple of rules wrong - which broke the game.  After playing through it though I think its sweet spot will be with the competitive version over the cooperative.  Isabella seemed WAY overpowered as investigation seemed plentiful and she was a hit point juggernaut because of it.

Update: For as good as it is I can't seem to get it to the table.  The groups I play with seem to prefer other games over this one.

Play #2.  The last game involved me having a very loose understanding of the game while the two others that I played with knew it and ran the game.  I didn't really get why things were happening, especially with some of the coop/advanced rules.  I learned the game myself today and taught it to my gf.  It took about 3 hours but we understood it...and ENJOYED it!!

I've gotten a ton of play out of this since purchase.  The expansion helps with that as does the hero pack.  I do find it a little long, but a genuinely entertaining game.  My first game was detailed earlier, so I'll leave that unedited.  We played a Co-Op Basic game with the vampire as our villain.  The basic rules and concepts were easy enough to understand.  Again as with last night, the components were top notch, detailed minis, excellent card materials, etc.  I actually preferred this soundtrack than Last Nights, more in theme and suitably cheesy (but its hard to complain when I've paid more for games with less extras).  The parchment sketch map conceptually is cool, but I heard a number of complaints that the black text was hard to read over the chaotic background.  

In gameplay it was reminiscent of Talisman, Arkham Horror, Fury of Dracula with some minor poor rules execution and vagueness ala Betrayal at House on the Hill.  All are games I very much enjoy and being able to play a lighter, easier to teach version of the above games in less time makes this a huge win for me.  The other two I played with were frustrated with some of the mechanics such as the convoluted elder system (which I agree is brilliant in concept but not great in execution).  All and all, I can't wait to play this advanced and take on another big bad.  I really want to like it alot more than I do, I'm hoping an expansion may help in the future.

RATING: 4
My rating is based on the competitive version of the game. You can actually play cooperatively, which, based on my understanding of the rules, sounds like it would be better. As a competitive experience, however, the game punishes you for being the first to attack the big bad -- unless you can finish the job. Otherwise, even if you've knocked the monster down to within one hit point of its life, your failure means that the next player can waltz in, steal your progress, and win the game with almost no effort of his own. Terrible design flaw.

The thematic feel of the game is good. Game-play is a bit boring, though I suspect we should have been moving along quicker than we did.

This is a great game - a definitive nod to Arkham Horror - but whereas a Cthulu game has to throw on layers of oppressive atmosphere to keep the theme (which AH does very well), AToE is lighter, and plays faster. It therefore plugs a gap. Fab in competitive play, although suspect a little easy in co-op play. Haven't played the latter form though as the Competitive works very nicely. Well done FF - lovely components and fast, entertaining gameplay - although somewhat cheesy photo shots!
Looking forward to the expansions...

Edit: Down to a 9 as played with 5P and becomes slower and division of items becomes too scratty. This is a 4P game - although still to play it at co-op level.
Edit: Down to an 8. Played it co-op and I actually prefered that style of play, but too darn long.
Edit: Now down to a 7 - good game but too long for my tastes.

Not a _bad_ game, per se, just kind of a dumb, uneventful one.  You roll dice for basically everything you do and not much that happens is terribly exciting or in your direct control.  My wife put it best: "There's not much here for people who regularly play games."  And I think there are better options for casual gamers, too.

But, there are some positives: it's easy to learn, player turns move quickly, and the setting and production are both great.

Significantly better than Last Night On Earth but still somewhat lacking in depth and very repetitive after a few plays.  Endgame (competitive version, twice) was very anticlimactic as one hero confronted the villain & killed it easily while other players just sat and watched; everything that came before felt a bit pointless. Played three solitaire games as mock 2-player cooperatives and the endgame was better, the tension of deciding who to save with your precious event cards adds something; expansions seem to make it too long.

Immediately liked this game on my first play and promptly purchased a copy.

There seemed to be a bit more to do each turn vs some other "wander around and bust on bad guys" games I've played recently, and the overall theme was well done.

The "village elder" idea is a fun one, and gives the town a bit more personality.  I wasn't so sure about some of the graphics, but the art-style of the game grew on me quite a bit towards the end.

The game is very easy to pick up, and the mechanics are approachable.  Highly reccomended.

**Update 12/7/09 - Keeping my rating at an 8, but I really think that you need to use all of the Advanced Rules to keep this game fresh.  The "Showdown Chart" is a nice addition, and rolling for dropped Investigation on the board is also a good one. 

*Update 3/29/2010 - After a couple of recent sessions and then the addition of Arkham Horror to my collection, dropping this to a 7.  Definitely a good game, but getting a little thin compared to some other choices.

As many have said, this is like a slightly lighter version of Arkham Horror (a plus in my book).  I've only played twice and really enjoyed it.

A decent horror game. Run around to different locations building up your characters stats, and inventory and be the first to kill the villian. Quick gameplay, easy rules, low downtime between players. Could have used a larger gameboard, text is small and hard to read from sitting position. Also when you have this many components in a game you NEED to include character mats, the table becomes filled with cards, markers, chits, ect. It seems they learned from there last CD that they needed more ambiamce or atmosphere rather then New Age, Techno beats playing in the background.

Pretty good fun. I prefer this to Last Night on Earth, mostly due to the theme, but also because it feels to me that there is more to do and I find it more immersive. Still ended up giving it away though. It just isn't worth keeping for my crowd and I have too many games as it is.

The first time you play this game, you really have no idea what the best strategy is, or how well-equipped you need to be before going to fight the werewolf.

Entertaining horror game with good visuals and some minor design flaws. Sometimes too easy, sometimes brutally difficult. It is less complex than Arkham Horror but has great atmosphere. The cheesy soundtrack is a nice addition.

The expansions increase the fun immensely. I love this game. Really looking forward to the new expansions coming out this year.

November 2012: Now that I have all expansions, this game has become a real monster in terms of space. I expect the next plays to become epic battles across three boards. With so much material at hand, the replay value is enormous.

Although I still dislike the tongue-in-cheek art direction of Flying Frog games, this game isn't half bad. In co-op mode, it feels like Arkham Horror with half the suspense, but also half the complexity (which really is a good thing). If you don't mind a lot of reading and a lot of dice rolling, this game enables you to dive right into the action with little explanation, making it suitable for a late night game with gamers and non-gamers alike.

RATING: 10
I think I've seriously misjudged this game. After many months lingering on my trade list I finally tried it again, but this time solo with only 1 hero. It was really good! Then we played it 2 player with 1 hero each (advanced game) - ditto!

The sumptuous components certainly contribute to the overall experience; if only other game manufacturers would use the same quality cards.

This game really gives a sense of adventure hence it's particular appeal for solo play. The only reason it's not a 10 is that eventually, after many, many plays I assume the cards will become too familiar. However FF are supporting the game well with expansions so....

update: 17 plays (including expansions) and it's still enjoyable, going to have to move it up to that 10!

A very cool co-operative/competitve game, nice artwork, interesting gameplay. It starts out in the game's favor no matter what and the advanced rules basically makes the game a lot tougher to beat. As the game continues the enemy grows stronger, which actually balances it out. A fun game to play with friends and family.

RATING: 8
Arkham Horror Lite might not be the most fair comparison but it fits pretty well. Do yourself a favor and make sure you are playing the advanced rules as the basic ones are a joke. Also, the co-op version seems to be too easy as my friends and I have never lost the game playing that way. The standard version is well balanced however and the race to find and kill the big bad monster is a very fun experience.

Good adventure/horror game. Better than Arkham Horror (which I have now traded away) - much faster and with more action and less downtime, and playable both competitively and co-operatively. Plays like a mix of Arkham Horror and Prophecy(/Talisman?) rather than just as a drawn out Pandemic as Arkham Horror does.

I have certainly played this co-operative (antagonistic optioned)boardgame themed very much around Sleepy Hollow. indeed, one of the protagonists is in fact the Hessian Headless Horseman! Players take on the role of investigators who are trying to stop the descent of the town's populace from succumbing to the evil that begins to make its presence known. I have to try the werewolf option with those who have played previously.

Fun for a roll and move adventure game. It reminds me of a cross between Talisman and Runebound but feels more gritty. I really like the art and the components are very good. The game can drag on depending on the cards that pop up. A LOT of luck involved in every part of the game as with most dice chuckers. It's fairly easy to learn and to teach but there are quite a few rules you will have to look up as you play and quite a few things to remember as you go that are not indicated on the player aid cards. I think it captures the theme very well. I would like to see how the expansions effect the game. Lots of replay ability in the base game alone with numerous baddies. I wouldn't dream of playing this game with more than 5 players are downtime would be horrid. I think 4 is the sweet spot and I couldn't imagine playing with 8. It's fun but I do prefer Runebound.

RATING: 7
Drenched in its tacky horror B-movie theme, an interesting (yet overly simple) mechanic of solving events unfolds the story in a randomized, but very cool and humorous way. You'll be chuckling many a time over sequences of horror clichés thrown at you, as you build your way to an over-the-top final confrontation with the ultimate Evil. Easily the most atmospheric boardgame I ever played.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love Flying Frog's Last Night on Earth. It's easy to teach, yet still complex enough to provide some strategic depth. It also does a great job of capturing its b-movie theme. Almost every time I've played, I have been left with a memorable gaming moment of some sort. When I found out that they were going to do a classic horror game, I jumped all over it.

Unfortunately, A Touch of Evil came up a little short for me. It's far too simple and unlike Last Night on Earth, very derivative. So much of this game is lifted directly from Arkham Horror that I have a hard time taking it seriously. It feels like one of those Chinese knock-offs that you find at your local dollar store, as it just doesn't seem like a whole lot of effort went into the design. The game also features one of my most hated Munchkin paradigms, where everyone pumps the boss up with stat boosts, so that no one can ever win. Again, it feels like lazy game design.

That being said, I did think that the Town Elders mechanism was a highlight. Having to figure out which member of the village council is working for the Evil One seemed as if it would be a very interesting twist. It is, except the experience is undermined a little by how easy it is to gather the clues and figure it out. It's just not challenging enough.

I haven't gotten to try out any of the game's expansion packs, so I'm not sure if they will add depth or address any of the game's other weaknesses. All I know is that as it sits, A Touch of Evil will not be cutting into any of my Arkham Horror time.

I've played this game once in 2013.  I hate to say it, but I don't recall it having much of an impact on me.  I feel like I was rolling dice, moving around, collecting cards, etc, but -- somehow -- not really doing anything (though, candidly, I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to be doing anyway).  I suspect that this game improves with additional plays, but given that my first impression borders on "indifferent", I don't know if I'll seek out a 2nd play any time soon.

Love this game!  The setting is fantastic and highly thematic.  Fun to see everything unfold during the game.
I prefer the competitive mode where each investigator is working individually to win.

Loved the Tim Burton movie, so I love the theme. In fact theme is the best thing about this game, as the mechanics can become a bit tiresome (with all the dice rolling). It's good, but Arkham Horror and Fury of Dracula are superior. Have played it competatively and cooperatively with both two and four players. Seems to have some issues with scaling correctly coop. I've been trying to get it to work well as a coop and still be challenging.

A very original game! The major strengh of this game is it can be played either cooperative or competitive. Easy to learn and play & very addictive once you start to play...

A sort of smaller version of arkham horror set in the days of yore (very themetically well done in my opinion) at first it seems very much a poor cousin to AH but the play time is quicker and it is may also be played competitivly as well as co-operativly, fun for me I would prefer to play this to AH (primarily because it is not as depressing as AH) 

one small minor niggle; the super glossy card covering seems destined to pick up every scratch, that said the usual(?) Flying frog production values abound; free cd, nice bits and a very attractive game when set up and in a fraction the space required for its sprawling cousin; a very worthy second attempt from flying frog, look forward to their next offering

RATING: 8.2
Another hit for FFP and a nice follow-up to LNoE.  I like the fact that you can play this both competitively or cooperatively.  Overall I still like LNoE better (Hey, it's Zombies) but this one has a nice feel of scrambling to get the right items and town folk identified to beat the other players to a kill.  There's some nice cards to try and thwart the first person to the finish by perhaps turning some of their hunting party (in the competitive game).  I still think the card production quality is Chinese crap but overall, I give the game high marks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Another fun game from Flying Frog Productions. I really like how cooperative the game is, yet it still plays very quickly and differently each time.  It really makes the players feel like they are fighting against a powerful villian.   My only really complaint is that their are "only" six town elders.  Would have been better if there were 10+, and only 6 were involved in each game.  As is, it seems that some of the town elders are better than others and thus its easy to "game" a little with making sure the ones you want are available at the end.  Of course that is part of the strategy.

This is probably one of the best horror games I have ever played. It rivals Arkham horror on so many levels that I can say it wins on most of them just for the time it takes to play it. With Sleepy Hollow soundtrack this game is even better. Both Competitive and Cooperative are awesome as well as the possibilities to add more difficulty if necesary. I recommend it to anybody willing to spend a quality time alone or with friends.

[b]May I recommend you play the the coop chart at the end of every player's turn. You will notice how the difficulty manages to handle any number of players and minions start to have a predominant rol.[/b]

Best theme game.  Mechanics aren't overloaded and convoluted, the theme is just right, and players have choices on what they can do to improve their character.  It plays well as a co-op game or as a competitive game, and the expansions so far have made sense and actually improved the game, rather than resembling other cash-cow co-op/horror themed games (Arkham, shame on you).  This may not ever be as popular as Arkham, but it remains a favorite of me and my friends and family.  Flying Frog is the best company out there that still PLAYS ALL their games, and makes games that they and WE want to play.  Great components, great measure of detail, and great room for variety in every gameplay session.  This game is the perfect theme game for me, where theme + mechanics = Joy

I'm told that our only play was highly uncharacteristic, in that minions didn't materialize and put pressure on the players until the very end of the game.

Worth a second try, at least.

I find it a great substitution for Arkham Horror - it has fewer rules and a shorter playtime.

I think I'd enjoy this game more if I had a better imagination. It's slim on flavour text so the items and events seem generic compared to something like Arkham horror.

The Showdowns with the villain seemed too easy, but then we weren't playing competitively enough. Even so it was fun getting to the end game - there's plenty of variety in the cards. The game was simple enough to learn, but there's not much of a problem in deciding what to do - it's just a matter of wandering from point to point hoping the random card draw benefits you.

UPDATE: played with the Something Wicked update, a much better and trickier game, with much more time spent trying to fight back the evil and preserve your own characters!

[b]WAS INITIALLY DISAPPOINTED.[/b]

Yes, it's Sleepy Hollow: The game. I liked the book and I loved the movie, and so I was quite excited about the boardgame. I was even more excited when they revealed you could fight vampires and werewolves as well as the Headless Horseman if you so chose. I am a fan of LNoE and Runebound - card & dice nirvanas - so you'd think that I'd be cockahoop over AToE. Wrong. I'm merely happy with it, not cock-a-hoop. Maybe an expansion will change my mind. Maybe.

The investigation and random encounter early stages are fine as you build up your characters - very much like Talisman - and I admire the idea of having a showdown with the villain, when you've discovered his lair. That's all good. Just that the game is not the sum of its parts, and I'm not sure why.

[b]ICKABOD:[/b]

1. Small functional board.
2. Brilliant stack of encounter cards.
3. Great photoshopped artwork.
4. Cooperative or competitive.
5. Choice of villain.
6. Plays well solo.
7. Great theme.
8. Nice character boards.

[b]HESSIAN:[/b]

1. Dicefest.
2. Very chaotic.
3. Fiddly.
4. Lots to keep track of.
5. Cards everywhere! - your table will be smothered in glossy photoshopped cards, I warn thee.

You know, I play many, many dice-centric games, and many games where cardplay is a huge factor - so you'd believe I would enjoy their inclusion here. The plain truth is, I think, that there's just too much dice rolling. Just too much. Especially the villain's cooperative chart. Combine this with rolling for movement - Talisman, again - rolling for encounter outcomes, combat, skill checks, and board space outcomes, and even I begin to get dice fatigue.

It's at the point whereby I believe that the game needs a teeny tiny fix. You don't need the cooperative chart; the encounters don't enhance the game, or deepen your immersion in the theme. It's just another step, another phase, bogging the game down. So, for now, we just use the basic chart.

UPDATE: I now own the [i]Something Wicked[/i] expansion and [i]Hero pack #1[/i]. And, let me tell you, SW does improve the main game, so I've upped my overall rating. I am fond of AToE, even it is a fiddly mashup.

If Arkham Horror and Last Night on Earth had a baby, the child's name would be A Touch of Evil.  For me this was a match made in heaven.   

My only real problem with it is that I think in the coop version, it is lacking a lot of the tension that Arkham Horror has.

Arkham Lite. Play this with friends who like fun, light sessions. It's a good gateway to Arkham Horror and a good alternative when you don't have enough time for it. With the standard 4 villains it doesn't really stack up the same in terms of variety, but there is another villain on the FFP site and an expansion on the way to beef up AToE. It's a great game that fills a niche in every co-op gamer's heart.

This has to be one of my top 3 favorite games ever for multiple reasons!

I very much looked forward to the release of this game from FFP, because I thoroughly enjoyed Last Night on Earth and knew the production value of this game would be just as superior as that of their other products.

This game is next to perfect in that it offers game play which is very exciting, immersing, versatile and completely fulfilling!

I am a horror buff and love games which fall into that genre, and this is an excellent example!  Although some of the villains are very familiar to many people, the game producers did an excellent job making them unique in this game.  Not only do they provide a very intense gaming session, but they definitely help create a sense of impending doom!

One of my favorite aspects of this game is that the players have the ability to choose which playing variation they would like to play - co-operative or competitive.  This very much adds to the replayability factor and satisfies both interests.

The game components are top quality!  Everything from the cards to the miniatures, chits, investigator sheets and board is absolutely stunning and features artwork that enhances the theme.

I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Arkham Horror, Betrayal at House on the Hill, or the like!

Light, campy, dice rolling fun. In the vein of Arkham Horror.

I'm a huge Flying Frog fanboy, and while I do like LNOE better, I still love this game.  The expansion makes it MUCH better.

Arkham Horror Lite.  Ignore the competitive game in favor of the cooperative version.  If you include the Something Wicked expansion the co-op goes from "mild" to "quite a bit harder to win."

This game reminds me of the movie Sleepy Hollow. Play one of the scared villagers and go on an investigation to find the evil that is lurking in the bushes. Find out which villagers is evil. Light roleplay game, with very nice components. The glossy photographs of real actors depicted on the cards is really nice and adds a lot to the immersion. Play with expansion is adviced. 

There is too much luck in the game so it is adviced to play this as a very light hearted roleplay possibly with drinks at the table and everyone in a joyful mood.

I've only played it once, and it felt rather boring.  I don't want to write it off, but I'm not overly eager to play it again.

Fairly typical Flying Frog game with roll and move and bonuses for rolling a one, but a great (extremely under used) theme, and quite enjoyable all told. Play competively or co-operatively, and I'm still not sure which is the best way to play.

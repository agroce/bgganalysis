GAME: Kolin: Frederick's First Defeat – June 18, 1757
RANK: 4227

RATING: 8
Excellent simulation of Freddy the Great's disastrous battle. Using a variation of the La Bataille Napoleonic system, Boinske and Dangel developed command rules that capture the dynamics of the period.

Not interested in this period, had picked up cheap on impulse, so traded away.

Pretty and complex. First and perhaps best of the BAR games to date due to maneuvering room. Grand in scale.

I admire the BAR tactics that CoA tries to implement into these period games, but it's at the disappointing sacrifice of playability. I can't think of anyone who has the time to invest into learning this (excellent) period's tactical system. Too bad.

Beautiful game, great system when you're in the mood for flint and lines of muskets doesn't get any better.

Definitely the ultimate 7YW tactical game out there in wargame land. Easy to understand rules (for a grognard, but also for marie-louises), colorful counters and great maps.

I tried the first and the second version of the rules.
These rules are better than the "la bataille serie".
Nevertheless it is difficult to play.
In brief ,you must desserve your battle.
Then you will evolve in a higly ressearched environment which can please any true wargamer.
I will definitely try the last version of the rules if I don't die before.
Kolin is a very challenging game for both the Austrian and Prussian. Noboddy can be disapointed.

This is the only BAR game I've ever played and I LOVE IT.  

It's alot of game though ... you need an opponent who's got a pair and has the disciplin to go the lenght on this.

This system is complicated ... there is a big learning curve which I undoubtedly will need to go through again for my next game *** sigh ***

BAR first game, and a fine sytem that captures the period. While complex, it felt natural to me, making playing the game smoother than expected. Still a major amound of time will be required to play

Tactical level game on Frederick's the Great Seven Years' War.  Hmmm....smells good.  Musket fires as infantry in coloful uniform marches into enemy with heads high.  A suicidal military operation in the Age of "Reason".

My rating is deceptively low. I love this series for all the historical details, but I feel that isn't the besto one to represent these battles in a reaosnable amount of time. Still Kolin is a master works. Dr. Duffy historical commentary is one of the best example of hystorical commentary ever written for a game.

Historically, this is one of Frederick’s biggest defeats (though Kunersdorf was more devastating) and illustrates the risks associated with his highly aggressive style. Relying on an approach that had served him so well in the past (and would serve him again), Frederick attempted a very surprising but risky attack on a numerically superior Austrian force. This time, through mismanaged coordination and poor communication with his commanders, the attack was bungled which allowed the Austrians to counterattack and break the disorganized Prussian army. The Prussian force was saved from destruction only by the timely arrival of a cavalry wing towards the end of the battle, the beginning of a string of very lucky events for Frederick during the SYW. 

Kolin was the first game in the BAR series and I personally consider it the best from a gaming perspective in that the actual situation modeled is dynamic, with various shifts of momentum and chances to attack and defend by each side. Players really get the feeling that they have a chance to put Frederick’s basic plan to the test. The components, while still very nice, are not up to the same standard set by later BAR games (although maybe my memory is playing tricks on me – it’s been a few years). Some corrected counters will apparently be released with the upcoming BAR Primer. For those who own the 3rd Edition rules that came with Fontenoy, there are files available on the BAR support site to upgrade Kolin to 3rd Edition. There have been murmurings of an update/reprint by Clash of Arms – I really hope they manage to do it.

My favorite BAR game, one of my fav games of all times.  Fast moving Prussians vs solidly immovable Austrians parked on a hill.  Playable solitaire, FTF, or as a group. First edition had lots of problems which should be corrected by the new edition due out next year.

I like the system, but this is a play 12 hours at a time type of game.  It is fun though.  Nice tactical feel.

While the onus of attack is on the Prussians, the Austrians often have a good chance of making some stinging local counterattacks. Well worth the time and effort to learn, from my perspective.

RATING: 8
Good slug-fest as the Austrians get the better of Frederick II. Allows for "what-if's?" too.  Seydlitz's cavalry gets a good work out in this game system.  Updated to version 2 rules but still enjoy this game and battle covered.

Huge, four-map game with excellent map and counter details, but it required my lounge floor to play and I couldn't afford to do that for long. I did get a full game once - the Austrians won - and I even bought the successor Zorndorff, but it was really to big and too complicated to play.

I raised the rating after played with the third edition of the rules and the counters of the primer

Excellent game - my first BAR game purchased back in the mid 90's and played several times solo. I have since purchased all the BAR games (not including the AmRev games) and this one is still the best in that it is the most balanced. the Austrians have a real chance.

This is on my playlist but I also own Luethen and that is the only one in the series I have not played yet so that is higher up the playlist.

First BAR game.  Good mechanics that, once learned, seemingly create an accurete representation of what leaders in the day had to face.

A version of the La Bataille series rules modified for the rigidity of eighteenth century tactics. The same great components and maps as the La B series games. This one catches old Fritz in the middle of the Seven Years War, finally running into someone who can handle his oblique attack. The game gives both sides good chances to avoid some of the tactical errors and the opportunity to win.

First game in the best tactical system for 18th century battles. BAR provides the same depth and similar scale than La Bataille does for Napoleonic Ages. 3rd edition rules in the making (to be seen in upcoming Prague).

A very intricate treatment of 18th-century warfare, not for the fainthearted but very rewarding if you have the time and interest. I managed to get Friedrich killed the first time I played.

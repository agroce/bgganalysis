Despite my love for Feld and the ideas and complexities he brings into his designs, I am little lukewarm on this one. Even though I said this could be considered quite a thematic game, that theme is not particularly engaging and the actions did feel largely abstract and trying to understand the necessary cohesion between them was more mechanical than thematic to me. This is not an easy game to get your head round though so I should reserve judgment for a while but I rather think that next time I want to play a Feld game, it should be Bora Bora or Trajan (or even Macao) rather than Aquasphere

I have a similar problem with AquaSphere as I do with Terra Mystica; I find I'm not so much debating between choices, but taking my one or two choices and daisy chaining a bunch of consecutive turns and hoping one of the middle turns isn't hosed by someone else. Largely multi-player solitaire, especially in terms of being able to hinder another player's win objective. Such an awesome theme and the visual components are fantastic.

A typical Feld in that there are multiple ways to score points, an interesting mesh of mechanics, good scaling for number of players (2-4), and a very thin and opaque theme.

The goal of the game is of course to score the most points by the end of 4 rounds.  Each round you have your "scientist" program your robots 3 times (and there are somewhat limited pathways/options to take here) and you use your "engineer" to assist these robots in executing their programmed actions in "underwater research pods".  You will have limited actions, and constrained options where you want to do many different things all at once but of course you can't do everything and often times you will end up not really doing what you wanted/intended at all.

You move your engineer through the interconnected pods but only if you have enough time to do this; time is a currency and it also allows for an extra action once per round (and it scores minor points for any left over at the end of the game).  When you move into a pod it's to activate one of your previously programmed, and mechanically you place the bot in the command centre of the pod which potentially will score you area majority points at the end of a round (there will be lots of "bumping" of bots to get control of a pod); each pod contains the same complete set of actions but some are more desirable than others due to the quantity or quality of that particular action in that pod.

The actions are:1) collect valuable crystals, which are worth points themselves but are also needed to allow you to pass scoring thresholds (and thematically your research team was searching for these crystals underwater in the hopes of becoming the best underwater researcher, whatever), 2) collect time tokens, 3) clear octopuses out of the pod- it's worth points to clear them and you lose points if you control the pod and they haven't been cleared, you know how those those pesky octopus are always messing up your 
research pod, 4) build up your personal research lab, you want to do this as it allows you more flexibility when you take actions and is worth points at endgame, 5) collect research power cards, these score you points at the time they are taken and also give you bonuses/abilities, 6) place submarines, which also costs time, and scores you points at the time you place them and provides a time income each round and allows for more scoring opportunities each round,
7) program a generic bot which can be turned into one of the other 6 specific bots (this is both a delayed and flexible action).

At the end of each round you score points (sometimes negative points too) in several categories and at the end of the game you also score points for completing overall tasks.  This is a well designed game and it's interesting, unique, and a bit odd; if you like Feld designs this is probably even one of his better ones.

I like it pretty well. There are many things to do and several restrictions on how to get them done. Time as a resource is at a premium, hard to get, and limited in your ability to store. But this is true of everything else as well. I was fairly well stomped in my first game out because I did not get to place subs quickly enough. As you fail to do this, you are losing points every round in ever increasingly larger quantities. This all goes to stay it leaves the impression that the game is too contrary to your efforts - and can be as a result extremely frustrating. But like I said, I like it pretty well just the same as a Feldian puzzle.

Probado a 4 y a 2. De los mejores juegos de Feld. En éste todo está entrelazado, unas cosas con otras, y la sensación de unión le da mucho sentido al juego, no como en otros suyos que están muy bien, pero son "partes de juego" para dar variedad a la famosa ensalada de puntos.

Another in the series of heavy-ish Euros from Mr. Feld.  This one is not as much a "point salad," but it does have some complex ideas.  It is difficult to setup and explain, but it plays so smoothly!  You do have to train your brain to work in a different way in order to play this, though.  It kept my interest, even with the weird theme.

RATING: 7
+ The visuals of this game are off the chart; Action selection/programming is very interesting and leads to lots of meaningful decisions.
- The control of sectors is too swingy for how many points its worth; Feels like you are managing things on a tactical level too much for a big strategy game.


Why it's previously-owned:
While it is a fun game to play, with plenty of cool-ness to it, the take-that nature of being able to bump pretty much anyone out of control wherever you wanted was just a bit too much for me.  
This got traded for Alchemists.

Abstract:
AquaSphere is a kind of worker placement game combined with pawn movement and area control by Stefan Feld. It is about overseeing scientists and engineers within an underwater research station. The scientists move in a rondel of six sections - the Aquasphere. The engineers move along a path on the programming board. The game consists of four rounds in which players are selecting actions until they all pass.

Main actions:
a) Move one's engineer one step further on the path of the programming board to program a particular robot for an action (gain a certain action token)
b) Move one's scientist into one section of the AquaSphere and activate a programmed robot to carry out an action
c) Pass or exchange 3 time tokens into a wild-card robot

Action types:
a) engineering  (red): take a special power from the current section (e.g., one-time boosts, boni for certain actions, ability to program extra robots)
b) laboratory (green): take the laboratory card from the current section (usually gives extra storage capacity or earn lab bonus at the end)
c) crystals   (black): take crystals (to advance in research or to pass check points while scoring)
d) time      (yellow): take available time tokens depending on one's storage capacity (used for moving around the board, launching submarines, and (once per round) programming another robot)
e) octopods  (purple): remove octopods off the current section (score points for each removed octopod)
f) submarine   (blue): place a submarine in the current section (score points depending on the round, score points for deployed robots at the end, help to get bonus time between rounds)
g) wild-card  (white): program a wild-card robot

Pros:
+ Simple but very deep and puzzly: players basically do "only" two actions (program a robot or use a pre-programmed robot)
+ Very restrictive framework and strong constraints limit what players can actually do
+ Time tokens act as currency and are needed to move one's scientist in the station: limits the available options even further
+ Crystals need to be collected as well because they are required to pass check points when scoring happens at the end of round (discard a crystal)
+ Engineering cards and research tiles soften the constraints a bit
+ Identifying and executing combinations between actions and cards is very satisfying
+ Programming board change each round leading to tough decision-making: advancing one step grants an action tile but also cuts one off from actions on the other paths
+ Controlling most sections scores additional points (area control), however, the more octopods in a controlled section the more negative points
+ Each section offers the same actions but time, octopods, and crystals accumulate making some sections more valuable than others
+ Submarines are required to unlock points for placed robots in the AquaSphere (race game: each additional submarine in a section gets more expensive)
+ Colorful blueish artwork, nice look and feel, good components and wooden meeple, main board looks a bit busy
+ Easy to teach and get into the game due to the low number of actions
+ Plays well with all player counts (rules adjust slightly on different player counts. Higher player count makes area control more interesting and more actions spots get blocked in the different sections)

Neutrals:
# Theme creates a cool underwater atmosphere but the gameplay feels very abstract
# More strategical than tactical: players should plan ahead their three main actions in a sequence
# No hidden information
# Players who are prone to analysis paralysis may lengthen the game, however, the overall game length is quite okay
# Player interaction: bump other robots out of a section by using an action of the section. Competing for time, octopods, crystals tokens as well as engineering cards and research tiles (first who comes, gets the stuff). Used actions in a section are blocked until the next round
# High randomness: programming tiles are randomly distributed on the engineering board (creates different paths) each round. Time tokens, crystals, octopods, engineering cards, and laboratory cards are added to the AquaSphere board each round.
# There are no new elements each game, all tiles are used, only the order and distribution of tiles change
# Modular: all sections are randomly plugged together to create the AquaSphere, additional engineering cards and research tiles are added to each section
# Luck is nearly abstinent, players have high knowledge of what will come next round
# Unforgiving if a player does not plan ahead: resources (time, crystals) are tight, e.g., a player may get stuck at a check point when scoring
# Each turn counts, no mental breaks except when scoring at the end of a round
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Rather thin player boards (pieces might slip around on it)
- Long set-up time: a lot of tiles, cards, and tokens
- Some actions grant additional points which can be easily forgotten (small icons exist as reminder)
- Set collection for different letters on the research tiles feels a bit unnecessary odd (however, adds another layer to it)

Thoughts:
What I like most about AquaSphere are the two basic actions that create such a deep game. The dynamic between the scientist and the engineer is very interesting and refreshing. Players usually program only three robots each round, so they have to prioritize their actions otherwise the game will feel very punishing and restrictive. The term "brain burner" is frequently associated with AquaSphere because it is very hard to plan three robot actions ahead while keeping an eye on the available time tokens, crystals, octopods and on top of that taking the possible actions of your opponents into account. My least favorite mechanism are the check points which limit the victory points gained at the end of a round if you do not own a crystal.

Similar games:
* Luna (players collect isle tiles to do certain actions similar to robot tiles in AquaSphere, also quite thinky, pawn movement, area control, very different player interaction dynamic)
* Bora Bora (complexity-wise, players have only 3 core actions each round, also quite restrictive especially when other players block an action on purpose, more competitive)
* Trajan (complexity-wise, players have much more freedom, less punishing)

Player: 1-4 | Time: 60-100m

Another weird game from Feld
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
1st play: This game has a really great theme, underwater scientists seeking knowledge.  Although the theme was pasted on, somehow it fit together decently well with the mechanics we were doing.  The chaining of actions creates an tricky puzzle.  Turn order matters and timing actions and point gains all come into the mix.  Unusual for a Feld, this doesn't feel like a point salad, there are clear objectives to pursue.  I haven't decided if the complexity helps or hurts this game, and my feelings will ultimately depend on whether the second play feels easier to understand how to accomplish what I want to get done.

No 2nd play.  The game itself wasn't too bad, but it was complicated enough that the idea of relearning it just sounds like a lot of work for what is ultimately a middling Feld.  His other games are better, tho I do like the theme in this.

I like the theme. It's a different kind of theme than I would expect from Feld. Unfortunately, the game agonizes over trying to translate the theme. The robots don't feel like robots. I'm not even sure what they feel like. They're weird. It's also a very tight, very punishing game. It's tight to the point where it is annoying. But it has some neat mechanisms.

Hmm.. 

Several plays. After the first it languished on my shelf for a year. Suffice to say, we found it odd. 

However, about a year later, we played several games in quick succession, mastering (well, honing) our approach and understanding of the rules with each game. I found it quite enjoyable, but still.. odd. 

If it were my only game, or the only game I had experienced in the last few years, I might rate it higher. However, for what it offers, I have other options to turn to. It's a "when in the mood" game, and not the first Feld I'd reach for. 

Limitation is good for design, and making players feel like they want more than they can reasonably achieve is fine. Aquasphere takes this to a different level, however, where the option restrictions feel less like an enjoyable tease and more like a straightjacket.

RATING: 3
I cannot recommend this for any player count, but especially with 2.  It is a cut throat game, with serious advantage for the first player. First player can time strangle the other player in a 2 player game. Whoever gets the time units first, can do actions, while the other player is very limited - including moving. Meanwhile the first player gets more and more powerful by upgrading their lab, and making more points because they have the time units and ability to do so. So last player's best option is to pass early, giving up points. Then after becoming first, last player should do the same - time strangle the other player. At least in most worker placement games, you can do some other actions when one location is blocked, but in this one, time units are required  move and do some of the actions, and if you are shorted in a time strangle by the other player... you are out of luck. The other player can have stacks of time units beside them in pods, and then zip over and take your stack you just programed a robot for. And if you cannot pay the time, to move through locks to get more time...too bad. The serious limits to what you can collect in other items just compounds this issue. So what I am saying is, really try to be first player and keep the other player from getting time units. If they don't have them, they cannot play well... if at all. Yes you could spend that robot for the 2 time units minimum - while they get 5.The problem is  2 won't let you do much. It likely will not get you to where other time units or good actions for you are. So... better to play any another game. Playing with more players reduces the time strangle strategy, but I don't need a game that cannot be played 2 player - the box should say 3-4 players. I am giving it 3 stars only at higher player counts. For 2 players it is a 0 rating.

RATING: 8
Somewhat reminiscent of Feld's Luna in its thematic quirkiness and move around a "spatial wheel design" with places to take actions, I found Aquasphere to be unexpectedly pleasing and amusing.  

Generally, taking actions on the Aquasphere board requires a two step process.  First you program the action on your player card, thus necessarily showing the other players that you are planning to take this particular action (very likely) this round, then, at your discretion, you take that action on the board.  Amusingly, however, that first programming action does not reveal which room on the board you plan to take that action in.  Strategic (plan ahead!) action programming and trying to acquire things (like valuable crystals, lab upgrades, capability upgrades, and extra time) on the board before others, seems to be the challenge and fun of the game. 

Interesting things to think about in the game include the use of crystals to enable one to cross VP thresholds, acquiring extra time as the currency in the game (really like that) to allow for extra actions, and moving down a changing "available programming actions" matrix which changes round to round, and has movement restrictions, thus, potentially confounding, or making even more difficult, the best laid plans.

Likely, in the long run, I will find Aquasphere to be more of a 7 of 10, because I do have some doubts as far as the replayability of this design, but after one play, for shear quirkines, amusement and fun, it felt to me like it deserved the 8.

Like Notre Dame, but so much harder.  You want to do so many actions, but literally only certain ones are available to you each turn.

It is significantly more difficult because instead of having your own section of the board and only worrying about the postal/letter actions, EVERYTHING on the board can be influenced by other players.

9/20/2015: Updated to an 8 and possibly could go to a 9. Once you get past the initial learning curve, it goes pretty well and the game is just agonizing after agonizing choice (in a good way)

You are playing the last round of any game. You have the chance for one move that could mean the difference between a negligible score increase and a monumental score increase. The chance is taken from you, without intended  malice, by another player. That is the entire game of aquasphere. 

It's hard to get a bead on the strategic/tactical balance of this game and it frustrates me. It bears mentioning that I don't require the point salad concept of "Everything gets everyone points." However, this game is the absolute opposite of that. On top of that, being in a bad spot doesn't necessarily mean you did not plan ahead.

Take the complex elegance of Feld's heavier designs and complement those mechanics with a programming element, and you get one of the more unusual titles in his portfolio. That said, it's just as interesting as a lot of his other games, and the colorful components and compelling theme really help it to stand out. Not as brain burning as it initially comes off, but I still haven't wrapped my head around the best strategies here. Good to see him step slightly out of the comfort zone with this, hope he will continue exploring.

The general feel and design of the game is quite familiar to those that have played Stephan Feld's games. But what sets this point-salad euro apart is (1) an area-control mechanic where the value of areas are constantly fluctuating and (2) a pre-programming mechanic that encourages players to think far ahead. Furthermore, the randomness in this game is well controlled; players know the arrangement of the research station and how the board will re-fill an entire round ahead. And while the upgrade cards and station tiles are random, I've never felt that the randomness was significant to the outcome of the game. Overall, an impressive brain-burning euro.

Component wise, everything is produced to a very high standard (Thick chits, tons of wooden bits, great iconography, etc). Only complaint is that the game is a bit too colorful and distracts away from the game play. Hopefully TMG will publish more Stephan Feld's titles.

The two-step action selection works wonderfully well in such a tight game. You're always paying attention to what your opponents are planning, but still, you do have some elbow space to adjust your strategy. Not a lot, but enough to keep it interesting.

I have to play again, but for now, it's a very positive experience.

Aqua Sphere had some interesting mechanisms and different strategic choices.  It felt quite restrictive at times and hard work.  Clearly my submarine strategy was sub-optimal as I went from ‘declared winner – let’s give up’ after the first round, to last at the end of the fourth round.  I look forward to exploring the game further!  In the first game the player getting the 4 point lab expansion research card in the first round and the same initial action was the comfortable winner.

In many ways this is the most Feldian Feld to ever Feld.  There should be a note in the box that reads: "You opened the box! take 5 point".

Starting the game for the first time finds one peering through a hailstorm of colored wood and vertigo inducing player aids.

A few rounds later you emerge from the chaos to find an engaging game with some very satisfying elements of area majority, programmed action, and worker placement.  

I think the theme is alright for a euro as well.

I like Feld games and this one Felds it up in a great way.

The most feldian of all Felds.

I read that among the first comments about this game, and after my first play I must admit that it was definitely spot on.

The rulebook (of the usual excellent quality by Pegasus) gives the wrong impression of a convoluted game, but everything quickly clicks and after a half game an experienced gamer should be able to play intuitively in a smooth way.

There are just 2 options: program a bot or use a bot to perform an action. There are 7 different actions, however, and the blanket feels very short: the game lasts only 4 rounds, and there are so many things to do, and so few actions...

I love most Feld designs, and AquaSphere will probably end up there among the better ones.

Dry game where you don't really believe in the theme : it's a mathematical game placed in a theme. It couldn't catch me because you have to undergo the game too much because although there are a lot of choices, you haven't enough time to do them. The time here is not like mostly that you want to do a lot of things, but fiches you have too short so you can't move around the board.

The programmable bots seemed like a gimmick at first, but they actually serves as an interesting purpose. By delaying a player's choice of action and its effect, the other players can more reliably predict the player's action and react accordingly. This makes the game more interactive than it might be otherwise.

I am not a big fan of the numerous currencies (VP salad, anyone?), but I am eager to try this one out a few times to see if the differences between them provides an interesting texture to the player commitments. For example, a lab building strategy maxes out at a certain point; ocotpod-killing is limited by octopod availability, ever-increasing over time; and crystal scoring is limited by how early one collects them, modified by a subgame of staying just behind various point thresholds.

It's sneaky deep. Only 2 actions, but you need to make those 2 choices for the next several turns, while sacrificing other excellent options. Very good, may be one of Feld's best.

On first play, this one was a hell of a brain burner.  However, on 2nd and 3rd plays, everything gels together quite nicely.  Plenty of decisions, and plenty of ways to get points (like any good Feld), but something about the programming mechanics and the way the game flows make this one of my favourite euros of recent times.  Brilliant!

First Play: A game that's not easy to explain so thanks to Jo and Andrew for that job tonight.

Quite a heavy game that is neither intuitive nor thematic. Long term planning is tricky but you need to respond to what turns up each round. I think the first game has to be written off as a learning experience.

This will go one of two ways, I'll either play this a lot and love it or play once more and sell it. Jury is out. Jury is back and says sold.

Wow. This may be the most brain-burner-y game in my collection. It's a resource management game where you're trying to collect the most victory points in an undersea lab.

What makes this game so bloody challenging is that if you want to do something, you're going to spend one turn positioning yourself to do it, and then doing it. Actually, make that AT LEAST one turn; if you don't have the resources you need to do what you want, you're going to have to spend a turn setting up the action that will get you the resources you need, then a turn getting the resources you need, then a turn setting up the action that will let you do what you want, then (finally!) a turn actually doing what you want.

That delayed-gratification distance from getting what you want makes it unique, but it also makes it a real bastard to engage with. I played this once, and my wife beat my by a single point; I'd expect a game where somebody won by a score of 62-61 to be a tense, nail-biting affair. But the only real tension came from wrestling with the mechanics.

No real story emerged, nor did any sense of laying out a strategy. There's not a hell of a lot of engagement with the other player beyond hoping they don't snake the resources you were gunning for.

It's an interesting game, but on a much dryer level than I want out of a gaming experience. Some people complain that Agricola feels like everybody's playing solitaire at the same table; I've never felt that way about Agricola, but I definitely felt that way here.

I would not go so far as to call it a bad game, and if I had a friend who was psyched to play it, I'd gladly give it another go. But ... man. This really didn't do it for me. And the learning curve ... seriously, if I busted this out for a friend who'd just gotten the hang of Ticket To Ride, that's my subconscious telling me I really resent them for something.

As with most of Feld's recent designs, Aquasphere has the signature point salad thing going on. The game felt puzzly, tight and tense. It plays relatively quick, but with some meaty decisions. 

After finishing my first few games, I wondered if I was playing the game or the game was playing me. There is player interaction aplenty and sometimes things don't go the way you've planned, but there's enough mitigation to overcome that. 

I need a few more plays to see if it has staying power, but for the moment I'm enjoying it. Great components and theme(?) to boot!

At first, I found the one-step-away programming kind of neat. Then again, you program two (at most) robots at any one time and they are very free to do different things. That flexibility is good, but it reduces the importance of programming. It felt more opportunistic and short term than I'd prefer for a game like this. I set a long term strategy in my first play and it paid off, but that was also lucky in that others didn't get in on my game and the "right" tiles showed up.

Interesting, if disconnected from gameplay, theme.  The game is also colorful and has nice components.  However, it's the epitome of what people dislike about euros.  The game handcuffs you, almost choosing your path for you.  It provides the illusion of choice but, really, there is very little.  The game requires significant forward planning but no move you make ever feels satisfying.  Artificial barriers are put up simply to arrest progress.  Scoring is obtuse and makes little sense.  The endgame is anticlimactic.

This possibly could have been a good game with more design and development.  As it is, it's a mediocre game and definitely dwarfed by Feld's better designs (CoB, Trajan).

So much to do, so little time.  Intriguing back-and-forth with programming robots then using them.  Definitely like the way all the different actions are interconnected.

Biggest blemishes on this game are long setup time and unintuitive scoring.

Edit:  Have now played Castles of Burgundy, which is a clear influence on the back-and-forth action chain.  The existence of a superior game with a shorter playtime that scratches a similar itch definitely lowers the appeal of AquaSphere for me.

One of the best games of Feld with great theme. Plays really well, makes tense interaction between the players and the replayability of the game is really amazing.

2014, 2-4p, 100 min. Programmed movement, area control and action planning/chaining game.

Based on Tom Vasel's review:  More work than fun, probably a good game for process engineers or those who dig long-term abstract planning.  Typical game from Feld with lots of mechanisms mashed together.  It is a heavy game that requires lots of long-term planning to set things in motion so you can do a particular action several turns in the future.  Your options are so restricted that it feels like being in a straight jacket.  You'll want to do stuff but then you realize that you don't have the required resources you need or didn't plan well enough (envision many turns of thinking "darn, if I had only done X differently a few turns ago").  As is typical for Feld games, the theme sounds interesting, but the gameplay is not interconnected with the them as something logical or easy to follow (why should it cost a gem to allow you to advance past random locations on the scoring track?; why should it be cost 2 time to move right when it costs 0 time to move left?).  Also, there may be runaway leader issues because if you fall behind, it seems like it is hard to catch up and there are various bonuses for those who are doing well (e.g., bonus points for controlling the most sectors).

Very nice decision, brain demanding game from dear Mr.Feld. Clock are the currency of the game, so 1st go for time clocks and store many of them. The bots look like an early version of R2D2 and the Octopods are cute, as long as they linger not in one of your controlled sector of the Deep-sea station. The crystals look more like Obsidian stones. You had to know what the symbols on the tech-card means, because they will ease your actions and cost you less time and so on. After your 1st full game you will know them all.

Played once. A good game, but not my favorite Feld. The board is so confusingly laid out that I found it hard to plan my actions, much less remember where my pieces were, and I couldn't get a good sense of the board state at a glance. I wish the rooms had been made to look different from each other so that they would be a little more recognizable. 

The game is difficult, cutthroat, and restrictive, all characteristic for Feld, but it just didn't resonate with me. I am willing to try again. 

UPDATE: Played again. Like it!

I certainly felt like "Point Salad" was an apt descriptive term, but in a very positive way. I felt a lot of interaction in the game, as you are constantly timing your actions to be in control of the sectors by the end of the round, as well as jostling for cards and lab extensions. My brain is completely melted after playing through because there was so much to think about.

Feld at 11. It feels so much like his other games it almost seems like a parody of Feld. 

Clever mechanisms nicely wound together with a really well-thought out use of randomness. Like Bora Bora, you look at the board and player aid at the beginning and feel terror, but things fit together well enough that once you start everything makes sense and is completely playable. You do have to hand it to the guy. 

On the other hand, the scoring system is as inscrutable as ever as you squeeze incremental points out for everything you do, and it always feels like solving an efficiency puzzle rather than competing against other players.

Meh, yet a Stefan Feld game I’m a little underwhelmed by… I guess I just have to realize that many of his games just aren’t my cup of tea; I like Trajan and Bora Bora a lot and absolutely love Castles of Burgundy, but I’m a bit indifferent towards almost all of his other games. And I have played enough mediocre games! This isn’t a bad game, but there is nothing particularly fancy about it either. It’s a bit boring and repetitive, and that’s after just 3 plays…

There are lots of neat ideas, and I must admit that I’m sitting and pondering what to do as the optimum choice isn’t obvious, well, because there isn’t any. The actual gameplay is extremely easy as there is basically only two things you can do, but it’s when you do it and how you do it that determines who is going to win. Strategic planning, foresight and timing are all crucial elements in this game!
I like the board next to the main board where your engineer is placed and you need to think ahead – you’re basically planning your whole turn, and this game only consists of 4 turns yet takes 90 minutes to play! So in that regard it’s a bit like Trajan as you need to think far ahead, otherwise you’re not going to do well. I also like the idea of the cards – but hate how it is executed… It is tough to make the best possible use of the abilities. There are lots of cards which ensure variety, but it takes too long to get them, you can only have a couple of them, and their benefits aren’t going to be used a lot… And that is kind of sad now that there are so many different cards.

I have tried it with 2 and 3 – with 2, the game is quite boring, especially the small area majority scoring. 3 was better, and I would probably hesitate to try it with 4 as it is going to be very chaotic and downtime can be an issue. Once again Feld disappoints me – not because it’s a bad game, because it isn’t, but I want his games to be better than they actually are…

Disappointing game, as I thought id love it. I thought the theme sounded cool, but alas, there isn't really much going on. The big mechanic in this game is that the action your workers take is obfuscated by one step- the game calls this "programming" your bots. Besides this one twist, you really are just moving dudes around to collect points just to collect points. The power up cards at not that fun, there really is no engine being built, and the engineer being limited in which path he walks added a little but not much. The white action space was fun to use though, because it was a wild action you paid for.  Not sure on this one, it just didn't feel like anything when we were done.

Extremely heavy, probably even more so than Bora Bora as you have to plan your actions ahead and take them o later turns. In addition, you can only plan certain actions based on moves on the board. It really brings out AP as you can get stuck into min/max decisions at just about every turn. 

Overall I liked the theme since it is different and it definitely has some good ideas. However, as the rounds go on the board becomes so full and full of decision points that it's too much work for me to consider it an enjoyable game.

First play I had a hard time learning it. I think it was partly the person teaching. Seemed like it could be fun if I got familiar with it.

Second play was much later and I learned from the manual. It was a little hard to wrap my head around strategy, but a couple rounds in it started to click.

Third play was fun.

Fourth play was fine.

I think the game was cleverly designed with both interesting mechanics and player choice, but overall I feel like it's not worth the hassle setting everything up and upkeep between rounds. I'll probably avoid playing 2 player games of it in the future since 3 and 4 player don't really add to setup/upkeep time.

Yay, moe point salad! It's getting kind of comical at this point. When explaining the game to other players, after having read the rules twice, I literally couldn't think of how to explain to players what their motivation is in the game other than to get points. I always like to see new Feld games, to see the machinations that lead to VP, and it's interesting, but also extremely abstract, despite putting bright colorful pictures and familiar nouns on objects. So why do I want to build submarines? Because they grant me one time per round, and unlock higher scoring potential for my bots? How is any of that connected in a reasonable way? I have no idea. Why do I have to pay a crystal everytime I make a quarter turn on the score track? I have no idea. Why does taking a card or building a sub give vp but building a station upgrade does not? I have no idea. Etc. Overall I liked it, but it didn't quite seem to meet the hype for me. Also minus one for the ridiculously oversaturated color board, which makes things looks far busier than they actually are.

First impression: Got to play a preview edition, fresh out of production. Lots and lots of rules, this is one of the heavier Felds for sure, comparable to Bora Bora or Burgundy. The mechanics are more interwoven than in Trajan or Bora Bora, but there are lots of them, nonetheless. The first plays are only for learning all the interdependencies, playing with a plan is required, but hardly possible. 

Thematically, the game felt flat for me. Nice bits representing Bots and Octopods didn't help much to feel like being in an Underwater Station. It could have been any other theme, but this is typical for an Euro game like this and no real problem.

Gameplay was quite fast, but we didn't do much planning also. I could imagine that playing with AP prone players this could be a very boring experience for me at last.

After all, I liked Burgundy and Trajan more, but would play AquaSphere again.

An exercise in wanting to do a lot of sensible things, but being restrained by the rules because they simply [i]force[/i] your attention to be elsewhere for about a third of your game time. It is no fun to be playing a game which feels like it was designed by starting out with an iron maiden, and then taking out a few needles at random points to allow for [i]some[/i] wriggle room; in addition giving the players the ability to carefully hammer out a few more needles over the course of the 'game'. I can almost imagine the distorted voice of Jigsaw whispering out of the box once the game has been set up: [i]Hello, &lt;players&gt;. I want to play a game...[/i] A good game arises by turning the maiden inside out, and putting the players on the outside as well. I find it sad that for the moment this sort of game is the only thing coming out of his hands (if I disregard small interjections): whether or not publishers seek out such designs, or that he only offers them is, from my point of view, a matter of conjecture. He's welcome to the money that these games generate... but I can't help but wish that for one time he'd return to his roots. That said, for better or for worse the constrained feel does in some way add to the subject matter as an enclosed deep sea research station isn't the most open of environments. 

Whatever else I may think of the game, I have to hand it to Stefan—with ever-mounting grudging respect—that he again succeeded in creating a game which [i]works[/i]. There are several lines of attack at your disposal, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and they seem to even out nicely in the end given capable play. I'll probably play another game of it (or even several) in the future as it is nigh unavoidable given the high amount of people in my gaming vicinity who purchased a copy. But I'm not going to search out this title: if I owned a copy it would eat into Trajan's and Luna's already meagre table time.

An excellent return to form. Last year's output had only one game with any real merit but this shows that Feld still makes great games. On a second play, the game feels a little scripted and the programming board feels less difficult than the mancala in trajan. Feels quite tame in comparison. I'm still interested to try again. I might need to recalibrate my expectations and view it closer in difficulty to Macao and Luna rather than Trajan and Bora Bora.

Juego muy interesante, con tema, y original. Abruma a primera vista con tantos colorines. Buenos componentes (salvo los tableros de los jugadores que son muy finos). Novedoso en cuanto a la mecánica de programación para las acciones. Difícil de explicar pero fácil de entender ya que en realidad sólo tienes dos opciones: programas un robot o haces la acción de uno ya programado. Uno más del Feld compatible con los que ya tengo. Muy bueno y entretenido! Lo que es increíble es que hasta a mi madre le ha gustado... y eso me encanta! Sobresaliente!

Descent game, appreciate the work behind it, but just couldn't enjoy playing. Of course this is one of those games you have to play multiple times to understand it well. But I just can't imagine it bringing me any more fun. I like complex games, I like it when my head hurts after 3 h of play, because the game was just so tense. But with this one I feel the complexity is not improving the gaming experience. It feels like Feld wanted to add complexity for the sake of itself. 
Another complaint is the board design. All the bright colours on it are making it really hard to follow what is happening throughout the session. You just can't get a quick overview, instead you have to study every detail over and over again.

So I totally understand people who like to be put into a complex, uncomfortable environment and work to get through it somehow. That is how I felt when I finished the game, barely having escaped the under water station (though was second of four, with two points difference). But that is just not something appealing to me.

RATING: 10
This is the "heavy Feld" in my collection (with Castles of Burgundy as the "light Feld").  I really enjoy the constraints forced on you by the layout of the board and by the engineering track.  You really have to make some difficult decisions to get what you need done.

Like Castles, the key is getting bonus actions, whether they come from getting more time or from red cards or whatever.  That's how you will sneak ahead, and over time these bonuses will accumulate into an impressive score.  

Plus, there's a nice balance between an overall strategic plan, and your immediate tactical needs.  You really have to do a bit of everything: kill 'pods, get crystals, build your station, place bots, launch subs, and of course get time and red card powers.

Don't forget about the area control game! That is huge, especially in a 2p game.  Use those green sections to put bots around the map.

RATING: 6.5
A mixed bag of things I like a lot and things I dislike. 

I like the engineering tree that changes every round, the concept of gating point thresholds with crystals is really interesting, and the importance of upgrading your lab makes for some fun tactical decisions, even if I'm not convinced those upgrades are in play long enough to really allow a player to capitalize on them. Turns are quick and, for a Feld game, the theme is fun.

But this game is very fiddly, visually parsing what's happening on the board can be very difficult, and programming bots is needlessly complex. The game also feels balanced to a fault--everything you do you do at the expense of something else, which another player can then easily take advantage of. The result of this is that most players end up with scores very close to one another, even if there was a significant disparity in how effective their turns were during the game. I don't mind the point salad but I do wish that final scores better reflected how well someone played.

C'est grosso modo le bruit que feront les joueurs qui n'aiment pas les jeux de gestion à la stefan Feld (l'auteur du jeu, mais aussi de Trajan, les châteaux de Bourgogne, ...). De la mécanique qui fait mal aux neurones (mais pas trop) avec du placement d'ouvrier pour aller récupérer des poulpes, poser des sous-marins, augmenter son laboratoire de recherche, un peu de programmations d'actions pour planifier ses coups. Dommage que le thème soit un peu superflu, mais la mécanique est sympathique. Allez, on prends son scaphandre et on lit les règles.

Recommended for 2-4 players, best with 4, 120 minutes, medium heavy, worker placement, Feld

Had a first go today and had a very good time exploring this game. The games looks nice with all the components, the meeples and the crystals. The mechanics are very easy, as there's just two types of actions to choose, either programme or execute, however the actions requires some planning ahead as after every round points are scored based on a.o. majority control and if you run out of crystals, this may seriously hinder your scoring as you need to pay a crystal to cross each red line (as happened to me once). Now I think I understand the mechanics I'd like to play this more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
There is a lot to like in AquaSphere.  
The random order of allowed actions adds a little mix while planning the round ahead.  There are a lot of actions to choose from, and a small engine can provide a big advantage throughout the game.
The scoring barriers take some planning.  And there are big penalties for those who do not watch the board.
The only thing I found distracting was the design of the board.  But the others I played with had no such issues.

RATING: 6
More interactive than other Feld games as he's introduced more of an area control aspect this time. Players are left with a tight game of planning and time management.

Scoring is also a puzzle and not straightforward with the red laser requirement.

Replayability comes in the form of random tile and card placement but players are given a heads up on what actions they can program in the future relative to their current position.

TMG has gussied up the game with a neat underwater lab theme. Components and art are functional and vaguely thematic.

RATING: 7
[29 Mar 2016] - 6.5 (3 plays; two with 2, one with 3)
While pictures of the game board look complicated and busy, the game rules and mechanics are fairly simple. This doesn't mean that the game is going to be easy. Trying to put the puzzle of options together is going to burn most of your brain. The scoring does seem broken - you only get 5 points for using tons of resources to deploy all the subs, 5 points for finishing the base but 21 points for collecting the letters. Makes it pretty obvious what one of the goals needs to be for all players. Maybe sub deployments should get points similar to the letters?  

[15 Feb 2017] - 7 (6 plays)
Bumping the rating to a 7 from 6.5. The game has a surprising amount of depth and while I still think you need to collect some letters, I've seen places where killing octopods might net you more points than collecting letters. So far I've overlooked the rules about placing a bot in the base expansion letter area and I think overlooking that small rule makes the game much harder and lower scoring.

[14 Sep 2017] - 6.75 (9 plays)
Thinking that this is the settling point for this game. It's very much a planning and optimization type of game. The dual nature of planning and then executing the actions is interesting in that it gives you time to setup for an action and possibly wait on it in order to fight for majority control of the base and score more points. The biggest drawback to the game is the art. I like colorful games but the art and colors make it difficult to read the game state mid to endgame, as the board is covered up with tons of wooden bits in all sorts of colors. Once you get past that, it's not a very heavy or unique euro game.

I don't think the complete the letters and base is a broken strategy either. Killing octopods earns points throughout the game and they do pile up as the game goes on. If you're the only one performing cleanup, keep your crystal count up (through the use of the killing octopod -> 1 crystal card) and time the majority control, it's possible to win the game. It's much harder to pull this off but can pay off when everyone else is fighting for the single "A" tile on the board.

[18 Oct 2017] - 7 (12 plays)
For the last couple of plays I've been avoiding collecting all the base letters and the difference in scores has been close enough that getting 1-2 additional base letters would have gotten me the win. I think it's possible, through the use of the right cards, leveraging the white bots and timing the area control correctly to win without the need to chase down only the base tiles. I've become convinced that the game is balanced, just very opaque in how all the parts fit together while the scoring for the base tiles is the clearest path forward. Plays with 4 gets too chaotic and I think this is really an excellent 2 and 3 player game. The visual clutter from all the colors does add complexity for new players and could have been better.

This is one of the quicker Stefan Feld games that I own. That does not mean in any way that it isn't deep and rich. This will make your brain smoke. The theme is great and the artwork is beautiful. It makes you want to play again immediately. Everything works together seamlessly. It's one of those games that you don't get quite enough actions to do what you want but if you look hard enough you can find something that's even better than what you wanted to do in the first place.

 Another hit out of the park from my favorite designer.

What can I say, I am a Feld fan! Love worker placement games with limited actions, so that every turn has bearing on the next action taken.

I love the way this game looks!  I also, in theory, like the way the options for programming the robots changes each round.   However, my overall impression is that this seems vaguely like a more convoluted version of Notre Dame.  I have a very hard time telling whether or not I'll like a Feld game before I play it.  Sometimes his game rub my brain just right (Notre Dame, Castles of Burgundy, Trajan, Spiecherstadt), sometimes they leave me flat after a couple plays (Macao, Luna, Bruges) and other times they just grind my gears in an unpleasant way (Rialto, Builder's Duel).  I will need to try this before I buy it!

 A new Feld!   This is the most Feldian Feld I have ever played.  Therefore, being my fave game designer, this was always going to be a good one.  And it didn't disappoint.


It's more complex than most of his games, but everything inter-connects and intertwines so intuitively that it is a breeze to explain and understand the rules.   So, as complex as Bora Bora or Luna, but easier to 'grasp' than both.
Having said that, I prefer Luna and Bora Bora.   

The mechanism of the game, whilst quite brilliant, is so derivative of other Feld's (especially Amerigo), that you yearn for something a little more innovative from the man.
But a Feld's a Feld and I ain't complaining.

The mechanisms of this game interlock very well, to create an interesting puzzle of a game. It is challenging, and interesting, but ultimately it fell flat, as it simply didn't "wow" me, in terms of gameplay feel. I am not against "point salad" (even if this game felt less salady) or Feld games, but it somehow brought not that much new to the table. A flowchart to be played, I have heard it described, and it fits. More interesting than that sounds, but still, it fails to create any long-lived interest in me. Would play it, however.

It's been a while since I've played this, but I'll try to comment on what I recall. It's a Stefen Feld point salad game. One of the things I remember actively disliking, was how restrained I felt throughout the whole process. I know you have the option to mitigate placement on the circular board, but if I recall correctly, it's better to plan well and use time for other things. Needing resources to continue scoring was a bummer. I love games that have cards special powers, but here the special powers were very dull. Finally, the point killing octopods got to be a bit much and I recall them causing the 1st place player to drop down to last. I just have too many other Euros that I enjoy more.

TRADED IT!

The mechanics are balanced and sound, but needlessly busy. Jumping through hoops to simply place a worker in a worker placement game is not rewarding and just adds an annoying "thinky" layer to the game. The need to over randomise all aspects of setup is also getting a tad old in games.

If I only owned a few games, AquaSphere would be a keeper, but there are way too many better games competing for the point salad spot!

RATING: 7.5
Aquasphere is mechanically well designed and thematically disconnected, but that’s pretty much par for the course with Feld. The multiple ways to get points but limited actions gives it some heft without being too much of a brain burner. It’s really quite simple once you get past your first learning game as there’s an illusion of abundance of choice due to the two interrelated boards and all the actions, but you can really only program 3 (or so) actions a turn.

I’m clearly entertained by games where you take actions to outproduce/outscore/outdo your opponents, and that’s what you’re doing here. You're working on your own action puzzle in a shared space with others to beat them to bonus thingies and also time your actions in such a way that you bump their pieces out and end up with your pieces in the right spots at the end of the round. That’s the fun of the game, and it works for me due to the action chaining and timing questions. 

The game is not nearly as thematic or as directly interactive as another action chaining game I like, Kanban: Automotive Revolution, but it also plays in a lot less time and has enough variability to keep it fresh for 5-10 plays, I think.

The setup is a little daunting, and when reading the rules & exceptions to the rules felt it was a bit much.  So I was surprised how easy it was to teach the game, and when I began to play, everything fell into place immediately.  There are only 3 actions to take, and one of those being pass!  The boards are so beautifully laid out with icons that easily guide you along the way.  And yes, physically beautiful to view as well.  Lots of planning ahead, never enough actions to satisfy my wants, and strategy to a level I didn't expect in this game.

This game has a very unique and cool theme. I love the underwater research station  which remind me of movies like the Abyss or Sphere.

It is another Feld game where a lot of different mechanisms come together to form a smooth and cohesive whole. This is definitely his tightest design though as each turn should be optimal if you want to win.

It is kind of like Marco Polo where the first game you play you are happy to just score a few points, but with more plays you will start to see the strategy and cleverness of the game.

I am amazed by what Feld has commited because this game :
- is very colorful, nearly unreadable
- it is intricated everywhere
- it is a puzzle to solve each round, with Cornelain choices all the time (here, "choose mean renouncing" has never been so true)
- it is short... but long at the same time because it's so demanding
- the board is changing but at the same time we still manage to get somewhere
- it is a rather interactive Feld : you will have to monitor what the other player can do or not before you
- exceptions make it annoying to me : having crystals to move the red lines ..... but not required in the final scoring; unprogram a robot to move the red lines; spend 3 times to program a robot...

And yet it's a very effective, well designed game. It makes you want to replay it straight away because it so frustrating, it makes you torned all the time but it is weirdly enjoyable.

I don't think it is samey with what he had already commited, at least the games i own and i have played (see above).

You can plan your entire round ahead because the possible actions are revealed at the beginning of the phase (there is no dice rolls here but programmation cards) and you will have to decide which path you will take given the central board situation and what you want to do. There is room for planning and efficiency here : how can i optimize my movement (this needs time) with the actions i am planning to take ? what about the majorities (beware of octopods) ? will i pass the red lines (this needs crystal) ? will i have to take this cool lab improvement and/or tech card along the way ?

This is certainely not the kind of long term planning of In the year of the dragon but i find that there is more planning and control than in his dice games (Macao, Bora Bora, CoB). It is somewhere in the middle and i find this challenging and fun, right up my alley.

Aquasphere is a cleanly designed game that plays smoothly where you can specialize yourself but you can't really ignore the others resources of the game because points come every round from majorities.

I find that the theme is pretty present here, way more than Trajan (i think that this game is laking theme integration and consistency) and CoB but a little less thematic than Bora Bora.

A very good Feld IMHO and i am not a fan of him but, with age and time, i have learned to appreciate and recognize his talents and merits.

A 8 for me. (Bora Bora is a 8)

Here is how i rank my Feld's games :
1) Bora Bora and AquaSphere
2) The Castles of Burgundy
3) Macao and In the Year of the Dragon

EDIT : after 4 plays, this game is too weird for my tastes. Rated down to 6.

Csomó olyan dolog van benne, ami miatt nem kéne tetszenie. Nevetségesen kevés cselekvés egy játékban. De minden cselekvést ezerszeresen át kell gondolni. Sokat kell előre gondolkodni. Emiatt azért holtidős a játékmenet, és aránylag hosszú is a játék. Ráadásul fogalmam sincs, hogy mit kéne csinálni a győzelemhez. 
Valamiért mégis tetszik, vonz. A kivitelezés és a téma nagyon jópofa, bár szokás szerint túl sok tematikára nem kell számítani. Van benne valami, ami nem hagy nyugodni, és mindig újra szeretnék vele játszani, és valahol ez a lényeg. :)

AquaSphere was not much of a hit with the game group, but I love it.  Painful decisions abound. Trying to work out a plan can be difficult, but rewarding!  Not for the light-hearted.

RATING: 6
AquaSphere is a fairly typical Feld game in that there are a lot of different micro actions, choosing from those actions is restricted in some way, and you're awarded a lot of points for many different things. The reason I think it is a much better game than, say, Trajan, is that thematic cohesion is much improved. Most actions actually make sense in game terms (still abstracted, obviously; don't expect a theme-driven game) and it is not just another collection of unconnected mini games all thrown into a blender. Interaction levels actually feel a little higher than they actually are, simply due to the shared board.

That said, the game itself isn't too different from other recent Feld output. It's much of the same game in different - and, I think, more attractive - packaging. That new packaging comes at a price, however: The game board isn't exactly the most clearly laid out imaginable.

Tief auf dem Meeresgrund erwartet uns Captain Nemo Feld in einer Unterwasserforschungsstation mit dem für ihn typischen überschaubaren Regelwerk aus wenigen Spielzügen, die sich jedoch hirnwindig verzahnen, dass eine Flut an Augenmerk und gutes Mangelmanagement entsteht. Das kann man als Überforderung oder als Bewältigungsabenteuer erleben. Das zur Feldschen Abstraktion gewählte physikalische Thema unter Wasser ist schön gewählt und gibt dem Spiel zur hier wortwörtlichen spielerischen Tiefe eine stimmige Form. Ein guter Tauchgang zu einem prima Brocken im Ozean.

22/02/2016: Score goes down. I find this game quiet difficult to win consistently. I think the problem are the many random mechanics of the game, which may seem that you get many options, but in reality it limits you so much.

Another Feld that I've wanted to try. I'd say this is the one that sets the boiling point for brain-melting when it comes to Feld. So much going on, lots to consider, and a great amount of player interaction. The theme is there and feels connected to the mechanics, but there are so many Euro-heavy mechanics that it is hard to truly believe in what you are doing, other than manipulating tokens all over the place in traditional Euro fashion. A big, sprawly mess of point salad crazyness. Typical Feld. Probably his most "Feld" game yet. It teetered on the border of incoherent, so it isn't my favourite of his designs. But it is brilliant and something I would play again.

I backed the TMG kickstarter for AquaSphere and do not regret it at all. I've played only a few times now, but the game is overall quite intuitive (with a few exceptions) and it plays deceptively quick for how many pieces there are. The game definitely gives off a feeling of not being able to do everything you want, but you still get points for almost everything else, which gives an interesting conundrum.

If I had to list a negative for the game, it's that the setup can take a while, but that's an extremely minor point. Explaining the game is something I've had trouble with, but after the first round I don't think I've had any players who it hadn't clicked for.

Overall, very fun game with interesting mechanics and some very tough choices to make. I can't wait to play again.

It is a bit of a mystery to me why this game hasn’t received the same level of praise as other Feld titles. Maybe it is the lack of historical theme? Maybe the programming aspect gives the impression that the game is more complicated than it actually is? Maybe, this was swallowed up the rush of Feld releases?

Whatever the reason, I found Aquasphere to be an excellent game, there is never a dull moment and you are constantly wishing that you had just one more action. In conclusion if you like Feld and haven’t tried Aquasphere then I recommend taking the plunge.

I like Bruges, Trajan, In the Year of the Dragon, but Aquasphere is an unintuitive, un-fun, themeless mess. Dull boring, diconnected slodge-podge of a game. Utter nonsense.  What do the letters mean (for scoring) as far as theme? It would seem only the programmed robots would be able to make sense of how the scoring mechanisms are connected- if they could only speak. I like what Tom Vasel said about the game, that it "felt like I was in a straight jacket" wih regard to making decisions.

The heavier of the two "circle" games this year. Nice components and colors.  Wished each board section would have had the background color of it's white station to easily see which one is which but this is a minor gripe. Also wished Crystals were only to keep you from falling back not to go ahead also.  That way they would be a possible strategy not a required one.  It's fun and has a well developed feel.  Overall I am happy about both this year's games from this designer.  Despite my initial apprehension, I will be keeping them.  Deceptively quick play, and while you can AP, it is the fun kind!

I am trying not to be such a fan.  This designer makes it seem so easy to make a solid game.. when you know it isn't!  It is becoming very hard not to be an all out fan.

I *think* I like this? It's intimidating when you set it up - I had a professional game designer almost baulk at playing during the rules explanation. But it does come good and eventually makes intuitive sense. Whether it's worth that climb is open to question.

Wow- this game is awesome. I've only played it a couple times, but I am feeling addicted. I want to play again.

This game is very much like a visual, chess puzzle. Every game will feel different, and it is fun for me to plan ahead and to try to outmaneuver my boyfriend. 

Pros:
- Once you know the rules, the game takes 45-60 minutes to play. 
- Every game feels unique.
- The components are high quality and look nifty. 
- Stefan Feld designed this game (if you like his work, this one is one of his best in my opinion). 

Cons:
- There is a lot to consider while you are learning the game (remembering all the ways to earn points, counting points, etc). 
- There is not much luck in this game, and the only way to win is to out-strategize your opponent.

What an interesting game! By looking at the setup and the rulebook it looks super complex, but when you learn how to play it you only choose one of two things (three if you pass). Don't let it fool you, the ramifications are huge! 

I like the refreshing setting (even if it's not too relevant for gameplay), the different look of the board and the action programming. It has interesting constraints and an interesting timing element to it.

I didn't think it played great with two because you can be too far away in the board so that your workers rarely interact/interfere.

Whoa!  There is MUCH going on in Stefan Feld's latest creation.  We have the usual Feldian elements: Few different actions in various nuances, combined with the typical point salad.  AquaSphere is very challenging as you have to carefully plan ahead for at least two, better three turns.  Action interdependecies are very strong.  All in all interesting, but for me the decision tree is too confusing and the game is too AP-prone.  Definitely prefer Castles of Burgundy.

Excellent game. Great depth. The game is a bit limited, in its material and possible strategies (it's not a rich Tzolkin or Terra Mystica). However, what makes this game so good (and fun to play and replay), is its excellent, dynamic way of puzzling your way through it. There is a lot of control (no bag, no dice, no blind cards given to the player. You choose which robot to program, which movement and action to make), but also a lot of dynamic randomness. Everytime, the setup (available cards, labs, crystals, time markers and octopuses in your area) is different. Also the programming sequence (of your robots) is different with each play. So maybe you know what to do (some kind of strategy, there aren't a lot), but can't do that (this game or round). You will have to improvise, to find YOUR victory route, with the most profit and the less cost. Winning or losing this game, doesn't matter that much (which game does ?). I always have a lot of fun when playing it. And that's what I like so much about it. The artwork and material is also great. I hope i get my 15 purple octopuses soon (they were not in my gamebox, but will be sent to me, by the publisher).

RATING: 8.5
An excellent "Feld being Feld" game. Very point salad-y but also very well designed. Victory is won only by making sense of the large variety of choices you have, but many things are limited, and so you need to watch what your opponents could deny to you (and what you can, of course, deny to them).

The action preparation prior to execution works nicely and the selection locations changing each round works much better than the cube tower from Amerigo.

Despite the games not really being all that similar outside of being a game with a set of actions that are generally restricted in availability (but with a way to sneak extras in, including a 'wild action'), this feels like what I hoped Amerigo would be, in a way.

Aquasphere is an interesting game, where players preplan actions during each of 4 rounds.

Actions can increase abilities, grab resources, possibly score points immediately, displace others workers/move workers off your personal board.

In addition, taking an action can involve moving your worker on the game board, which can and will affect the options available to you next turn.

All of this makes for a lot to think about, and a decent amount of player interaction can make a good move less desirable quickly.

At this point my internal question is: how much of this play is game-generated randomness, and how much is controllable madness? (Definitely liked this better with 4 than 2, for increased 'controllable madness').

Started at 7.25, holding off on increases for now.

My main comparison for AquaSphere is Luna. I'm still undecided on whether there's room for both in my lean collection.

AquaSphere feels like a much tighter game than Luna does, with much more intuitive strategy. At times Luna can feel like a disparate collection of minigames with brutally converging goals. Although the tension makes the game great, it is also unpleasant. The interaction is much more direct, personal, and mean than here in AquaSphere. The theme of AquaSphere may be more weakly tied to the mechanics, and to some it will feel like a very abstract game (then again, I prefer Euro themes that leave a lot to the imagination). However, AquaSphere's theme also has broader appeal. I find Luna's theme refreshing, but let's be honest, it's a bit esoteric.

To talk about the game on its own, I found that AquaSphere is quite a bit easier to learn than it may seem at first glance. I would think most players could understand how to play with the exception of a few of the scoring mechanisms after a couple rounds. Aside from the many different ways in which to score, the gameplay is almost simple. I would call AquaSphere a medium weight game in terms of learning and rules complexity, and a dedicated beginner could play it. Stemming from this, the game doesn't play too long. One thing that surprised me about AquaSphere is that although players are severely limited in the actions and number of actions they can take (via the bot programming track generally only allowing 3 actions per round and only a few other resource-intensive ways to perform actions), there aren't any severely punishing or conflicting strategies. What I mean is that while it will become obvious somewhat quickly that you have to do a little of everything in AquaSphere to be successful, focusing on one thing doesn't seem to conflict with your need to do other things, at least not as a general rule. Yes, you can make debilitating mistakes, but the mistakes don't compound that much. At the very least, the mistakes are yours to make and not so much the brutality of the game. Plus, there are so many ways you can influence the game, even from a weak position at the end, that because it is a pretty short game, it almost feels light to me.

Anyway, could just be me.

(01/24/2015) Comment based on 1 play.

This is one of Stefan Feld's lighter fare, and particularly limiting with only 12 programming actions! (4 turns, with only 3 "programming" actions each turn, but with the possibility of buying one more action.) Each programmed action is usually then executed, so there are about 24 "actions" per player per game. The theme is somewhat light-hearted, somewhere along the lines of Captain Nemo and 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.

As always, Feld is coming up with new mechanics for his games, for the sake of coming up with novel mechanics (which may or may not have anything to do with theme) and this one is no exception. It takes awhile to get one's head around this, but once you do, the gameplay is surprisingly simple and quick. However, Feld always gives players many different avenues, so this is the "nut" to crack in his games. Usually, Feld has some form of "chaos" in his games, be it random dealings of cards, dice, or cube towers. As with other games, the board layout has random seeding of resources. The central part of the game is the action board where players move from one action space to another, but they are constrained to specific paths. The distribution of the action spaces is randomly determined each turn, but at least the players can see what the paths are for the next turn.

The most confusing part of the game is that you must spend an action to "program" a 'bot to execute one of seven possible actions, depending on what spot you move your action pawn to. Later on, the programmed 'bot can execute the action, provided a researcher pawn on the main board can reach the designated spot where the action takes place--be it to collect "time" (which seems to be currency of the game, allowing for movement and purchasing of subs), collect crystals (to "unlock" ceilings on the score track), kill squids (which penalize you at the end of each turn, if they are present in the aqua sphere you control), build a sub (to gain time and VP), gain a card (with special powers), gain a station piece (to expand hand size, crystal and time limits, or end game scoring), or program another 'bot.

The program 'bot --> place 'bot and move researcher to spot to execute action --> get stuff sequence is hard to visualize at first, but becomes easy fairly quickly. There is an element of area control, as in how many aqua spheres are controlled by your 'bots, how many crystals you have, and how many 'bots (constrained by how many subs you have out) you have out on the map. These elements score at the end of each turn. Collecting sections of your own station, each with a letter, is relevant in end game scoring. All elements in the game score in triangular numbers: 1-3-6-10-15-21-etc. That there are so many moving parts, with players getting in the way with each other, makes the game chaotic like a Feld game should be. It is in this chaos that if a player can make long-term plans, as well as getting short-term advantages, will be the key to victory.

Compared to other Feld designs, this is far simpler than say Trajan or Castles of Burgundy. It seems like it [i]should[/i] play quicker, but our first play took two hours, which was a bit long. It should become faster with repeated play, because there really isn't anything here that should take that long. However, for 100 minutes, it seems a bit cut-and-dried for what it offers. Our group seems to want to play something else, for that investment in time. The theme somewhat clicks, with silly 'bots running around and making a mess of things, but it is not immersive. It's not bad, but it's not great. I would prefer playing two games of Rialto for one game of this, for the given amount of time. It is a "7".

遊戲流程:
1.共進行四回合，每輪分為中程計分與結束最後計分。
2. 共有3個步驟
(1)替機器人編程
 工程師按編碼箭頭進行編程，機器人放置在個人圖板編程區，每次不能有超過2個編程的機器人，超過需退回個人區並得到2時間。
另外每輪一次付3個時間標誌，可以選擇任意編程。
(2)用一個編成機器人行動
首先移動科學家決定要在哪個部門執行行動(付出相對應時間)，放置機器人至中間控制區，踢到其他機器人至休息區，超出人數後，只能個顏色保留一個，之後執行行動。
(3)PASS， 先PASS順位會往前。
行動:
!!!1.拿取研究室擴張，有對應字母可以選擇放置對應部門機器人控制。
2.拿時間(不足拿兩個，若超過只能拿取相對應擬研究室數量)
3.拿晶體，晶體當計分超出紅線需付出，分數超過後不會退到紅線後。
4,打章魚，獲取對應知識點數。
!!!5.放置潛水艇，每個部門只能有1個自己潛水艇，潛水亭可以得到中間知識分數。
6.拿取研究卡，若無法容納其他研究卡，也不能使用立即使用卡片，卡片不可以棄掉，拿取中央知識分數。
!!!7.為一個機器人編程，放在該對應部門白色行動區的編程符號。
中程計分:
1.拿取時間標誌(看潛水艇)與使用中程能力卡片，順序不拘
2.加總計分:(加總完後計分超過紅線需付出晶體)
a.控制區域分數6分，平手都3分
b.進場機器人分數(沒有潛水艇的欄位上最高分數)
c.晶體分數加分，控制區域部門章魚扣分
下一輪準備:
抽取實驗室擴張與研究卡，覆蓋在舊的上方
清空時間標記，根據中央版塊配置下一輪，晶體與章魚不清除，新增上去，調整總部編碼區，翻開下一回合編程卡。

First play went really well. The puzzle is tough, but the rule set is surprisingly simple. Totally ignored subs and realized how much that can hurt you in the end. Wondering how viable an Octopod exterminator strategy would be. In our game there were a lot of Octopods left on the board.

Looking forward to playing again.

Feldian planning game ahoy!  Everything you want to do takes two steps (programming robots and using them), but you have limited actions and you NEED THEM ALL AUGH. But that means you need to be on the lookout for way of getting extra actions or using your actions better, like the special robot-programming action, which I think is really important. Plus, the theme is really cool. Good stuff.

Very enjoyable Feld game about scientists programming bots and carrying out actions in a underwater research station. Some of my friends thought the theme is absolute nonsense but o the contrary I felt this is one of the more thematic games from Feld compared to Burgundy or Trajan. The action selection is very interesting that you need to program certain bots before you carry out its respective actions. As with all Feld games there's always some sort of punishment element in the game and this is done with the Octopods invading the research station creating some really tense decision making.

27/09/2015 Bordspeltornooi Winning Movez, Lokeren. Tactisch spel in vier ronden. In je beurt programmeert je ir. een robot voor een toekomstige actie (blauwe duikboot plaatsen, groen cirkelsegment, paarse oktopussen verwijderen, gele tijd nemen, zwarte stenen nemen, rode kaart nemen, witte variarobot) ofwel plaatst je wetenschapper er een. Veel verschillende scoremogelijkheden (duikboten, kaarten, lege robotplaatsen,...). Wetenschappers verplaatsen en duikboten zetten kost tijd. Sommige kaarten leveren significante voordelen op: zeker op spelen! Zwarte stenen leveren punten maar laten ook toe de rode lijnen op het scorebord te passeren. Vrij goed maar nogal mechanisch spel, met zeer veel mogelijkheden die je tijdens het eerste spel zeker nog niet allemaal goed doorhebt.

Somehow this game fell flat for me. I love Trajan, Bora Bora, and Luna so I had high hopes for this one. The problem I think was that it felt too restrictive. It seems like Feld games are usually about restrictive action selection, and a big part of playing well is finding clever ways around those restrictions, but in Aquasphere I felt like there was less opportunity to work around them than in the others. Also, I felt like the different actions weren't integrated to the degree that they were in some of the others.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2015)

At last I got to play this fabled Feld game. At first I wasn’t blown away by Aquasphere, but with more plays I’m beginning to like it more and more.

When the game was explained to me, I found it to have many similarities with other Feld games (obviously ;)) the variable VPs awarded based on which round you are, the negative factor that can destroy you if you don’t manage it (octopuses), the tightness of the game (you want to do much more than you can), the player boards, etc. All things considered, I like all of those.

The rules aren’t hard and the graphic design of the game helps a lot in this regard, however many friends have found the board to be “too colorful”. I like it but I agree it can be a bit too much. For me, the board is very similar in graphic design to the one I found in Il Vecchio, I’m not sure if there is a relationship between the two games but when I see one board I automatically think of the other one.

As I said before, the rules aren’t hard to grasp, but the game offers a lot of interesting decisions (among them, which action to program, which card to choose, which lab module to choose, where to execute the action). I really like it. Love the limits imposed by the game, you can’t advance in VP if you don’t have crystals and many actions are limited by the space available in your laboratory. As the decisions aren’t obvious and can cascade into very complex interactions, I think the game has a medium weight. 

Aquasphere offers a plethora of options, so the game can slow down a lot in the last couple of turns with slow players, due to this, I think it’s best with 3 players although I will play gladly with 4 players if requested.

The theme sounds great but I don’t feel it during the game. Most of the actions don’t make thematic sense, this is a minor quibble for me though.

Aquasphere has some luck, but I feel it’s impact is minimum most of the time, a huge plus in my book.

My copy of the game came with a broken yellow robot (which is being replaced by TMG :D) but also came with a misprint engineer board (which cannot be replaced :cry:). This is a minor issue for me.

Bottom line, Aquasphere offers interesting decisions in a short(ish) time frame (only 4 turns). I like it so I will keep it in my game collection but I found it has less tension than Bora Bora so, for now, its rating is a borderline 7.0. I want to play again soon.

Current Rating: 7.0

2016-09-04 - This feels like a bit of a departure from the norm for Feld. It's not what anyone would call point salad. It requires a lot of planning and focus. You'll never be able to do as much as you need to, so you'll have to decide what to sacrifice. This is definitely a brain burner.

RATING: 7.5
* Kickstarted! *

Worker placement game with the double catch that the order of options available changes between turns, as does the placement of additional scoring abilities, all based on the random selection at the beginning of the game. But the biggest catch is that the most points go to the person who can push the others out of his way to get in the right spots at victory point time. High quality components: the board is composed of pieces that connect together to make a round shape with spots for additional pieces to sit against, and the meeples are in the shapes of octopi and little boats. The rules seem complicated, but once you play a round or two, it goes pretty easily. When you're finished, you'll be surprised at how balanced the scores are.

PLUS: quality of points, difference of play between games, balance
MINUS: not much interaction between players

This is a fun game.  Like the other Feld's I have tried, it is fiddly and takes a while to set up.  But, I really like the two-step approach to the actions (programming and deploying the bots).

Played Oct 2014

Feld finally returns to hurting us! You suffer purple octopod death, you suffer if you aren't prepared with crystals when you advance on the score track, you suffer when you try to move around... Near endless suffering, it's so excellent. Tight decisions, lots of interaction and, of course, a very interesting action selection system. For me this is the best Feld since The Castles of Burgundy (and I have played them all).

--------------------------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 2014

This is definitely a must play for me. I love Feld's more complex games, and while this isn't quite at the Bora Bora level it's the most complex game he's released since that one. The action selection mechanic is mixed with some area majority and of course lots of leafy greens... yummmm point salad! Sick of salad? Have some point soup!

On a very high level I think this game has some similarity to Trajan in that you have a personal board where future actions are stored (in this case the bots that you've 'programmed', in the case of Trajan the mancala). The crux of both games is in carefully selecting which actions you want to do now, and which actions you will want to do in the future. You may need to compromise some of your desires to make things work smoothly.

Unlike Trajan there is a lot more direct player interaction in Aquasphere. Players are fighting for majorities, resources, submarine placements, laboratory extensions, ect...

When I first heard about the game I was a little worried that it featured programmed actions, which is a mechanic I don't often enjoy. Luckily for me there really isn't anything like that in the game. Thematically you program your bots to do certain actions, but it's not programming bots like in Twin Tin Bots and similar games.

The only disappointment was the tie break rules. I have become rather fond of Feld's elegant tie breaks which usually break the tie in one Feld-swoop. Instead he has us comparing bot controlled spaces and then crystals in our possession. Why not use the passing order in the last round which is otherwise meaningless? I guess I'll start to appreciate the logic behind this choice once I've played a few games.

RATING: 7
Fits in perfectly with Trajan, Bora Bora and Castles of Burgundy (in order of descending similarity). Actually, it's so close to Trajan, that it's best described by the respective similarities and differences.

Instead of the mancala driving the game in Trajan, Feld invented a steering center vaguely similar to the one Rieneck introduced in [gameid=74102]. As in Trajan, there are six principal fields of action although to mix things up Aquasphere features a seventh 'joker' action. Both feature some form of area control, of developing special skills and set completion. Both are explanation-heavy, of comparable complexity, depth and length - the basic structures are so similar up to the same amount of four rounds with intermediate scoring that I don't see much sense in owning both.

Still, here are the differences. Aquasphere features a currency, time. There's a rondel instead of separate areas on a board. It's under water, it's much more colourful, it feels more opaque. The intermediate bot scoring and the endgame scoring are lacking as they don't differentiate as much as I would like them to do. After one play, I prefer Trajan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy the light programming thrown in this game to help players determine what other players will do and plan their turns accordingly. My main complaint is with the way the entire board is reset in between each round. Seems to end up inserting a bit more random than I feel is necessary for one of Feld's heavier games.

The theme on this one is pretty hilarious, though I suppose it would be unfair to expect Feld to provide a convincing or interesting theme. I would be curious to see what the original theme of this game was, and would love to hear the negotiations or brainstorming involved in creating the current theme.

This definitely feels like a Feld. While it is not as annoying as Bora Bora, it definitely works well mechanically. But I don't feel excited by the game or motivated to crank the wheel further. I probably need to revisit my rating after further play.

Another awesome game by Mr. Feld. It seems like he can't do wrong for me. Fanboydom aside, though, this is a game with tons of options and way too few opportunities to do everything you want to do, so you really have to be economical with how you use the few actions that you have. This one is far simpler once you get into the flow of things than the rulebook suggest. I had a really hard time getting through that one. Rhado helped me quite a bit to understand what's even going on.

This is a mish-mash of mechanisms which don't interact with one another, and the most interesting one (the loading bay and point income for workers on the board) is not the actual focus of the game. 

Also, needing to pay crystals to pass a point threshold has to be the worst mechanisms since roll-and-move. Actually, this game suffers from the "Agricola" problem: half of your actions are stuff you need to do just to keep going: get crystals to make your points go on the scoring track, kill squids so you don't lose too many points, get time tokens to go around the station, boost your labs to be able to make your actions more than just baby steps...

Hard pass.

I don't want to play this anymore. Feels like I'm hemmed in when I do; you have many problems but not enough actions to solve them in, and the game punishes you for this inevitable outcome. But this doesn't fully explain why I don't like it, because Forbidden Island and Pandemic both present many problems and give you fewer action points than you need to solve them all, and those games are fun. AquaSphere just makes me feel like my hands are tied.

Loved its mechanics. It is deep & interesting. Though v. hard to grasp. 

Only negative is that the final scoring too much affects the final outcome. In my experience it felt like the whole effort throughout the game was a bit useless & it would be much better to only focus on the final. 

You get the feeling that the game would leave a better after-taste if all the scoring was done throughout the game. Thus, it would stay in line with the rest of the game where you have relation of action-result preserved. I strongly fell it would make a greater game of already good game.

07-01-2015 - FELD!  I think I recall people saying this Feld isn't as complicated as some others.  I would disagree.  This one has so many strange things going on, parts don't make sense (it takes no time to program a robot, but it does take time to walk down the hall?), kind of convoluted, etc.  BUT, I still enjoyed it quite a bit as a mental exercise, and the board is pretty gorgeous if not a little (a lot) busy.  I'll probably buy it eventually.  Yay Feld!

Fun game. Lots of interesting features and strategies (i.e. collect lab cards, defeat octopods, build submarines, etc...). Basically you have a scientist and an engineer directing bots around. You have to plan a few moves ahead to beat the game.

Interesting game - offers enough of interaction, competition and puzzle. Unfortunately it takes (again) quite amount time to teach it, which why this deserves 7 instead of 8. But better than Bora Bora, Castles of Burgundy or Trajan what comes to these designer Feld's games which ones are better when played with 3 than 4 players...

So this one is Stefan Feld 2015, and this is the good one. If you didn't like Feld before, this is not the game that is going to change your mind, but I believe it belongs to the better half of his games. Of course it follows the recipe: take a somewhat original action selection mechanism, then build some usual stuff around it, possibly using some creatively constructed map as well. I did not like the look of the game board first but during game it seemed rather functional. And the game itself is fine, of course it's JASE but a well-assembled one with some majority scoring included. A quite pleasant one, even though I still prefer simpler, clearer designs.

A Stefan Feld Game that is flying under the radar.  Game play is very smooth, can be a little AP inducing, however it doesn't take away from  the overall magic of the game.  It's an incredible value, super game for the money.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Game looks busy but is actually fairly simple to play.  Organizing actions efficiently may be a bit more challenging however!  There's octopus which are quite bothersome as they subtract points from your score if you were the last one to take an action in a sphere...and the penalty increases dramatically the more that are present.  Of course, you can also score some nice points removing them but that doesn't always seem efficient.  Building up one's lab allows for increased capacity of actions assuming there are extra materials lying around when the action is taken in a sphere.  Subs grant time income and also allow for greater scoring for bots in play.

I love belfort, and I like aquasphere. This is a game that forces you to make tough choices because you aren't going to be able to do everything you would like to do. It's a little confusing and a lot time consuming, so I wouldn't recommend it for casual players. But you give me a game where luck isn't a factor and I'm all in.

Interesting mid to heavy weight Euro with some worker placement and some area control elements.  There's room for some strategic planning but the game also rewards clever tactical play in the moment as well.  Programming the bots means that there's an extra level of forethought required when planning your turns.  The ugly board and somewhat silly theme shouldn't turn you away from this Feld game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great brain-burner as you are constantly adapting your strategy to the changing conditions with each player's move. Game can be a little fiddly with all of the setup pieces and needing to reset the board again between each round. Easy to forget small rules and parts of set-up if you don't know the game well. Takes a game or two to get all of the rules down, but worth the effort. Glad I have this Feld in my collection.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably the heaviest Feld game that I have played.

Basically this is an action pre-selection game. Your engineer selects future actions. Later, your scientist carries out one of these actions somewhere on the board.

The pre-selection mechanic is creative. After I learned to watch the other player boards, my turns got much better. You know what they can possibly do so plan for it.

Also, the pre-selection mechanic encourages strategic thinking. Actions need to be planned at least 1-2 turns in advance.

The heaviness comes from this strategic component, the probability space of where to take your action, and management of various resources (time, crystals, research, etc.), each has its own special rules.

This game will do well on BGG, if the theme doesn't get in the way.

Unique theme, cool pieces, and a neat "programming" action that makes turn order really matter, but ultimately this game felt like a complete point salad/optimization fest. Killing octobots gives you points, having submarines gives you more time and points, getting upgrades give you more capacity to hold stuff and points, a lot of special abilities make it easier to get points. Sure many games are just at their core an exercise in building an engine to most efficiently generate points, but this game makes the point grabbing so painfully obvious that it sucks out the fun of having the feeling you're building something along the way. Still a good game with tough choices, but with the theme it could have been so much more

This is a good game but is really a brain burner.  I enjoyed it but it is not a game I think will hit the table very often.  I think I'll keep it in my collection for when I want a real brain cruncher but that's it.  There are just so many opportunities and options that you have to consider all the possible actions you can take and are often re-thinking and recalculating your moves.

This might be my favorite Feld. The game is loaded with choices, and options, and though others might take your first choice you always have a second and even a third.

The game is initially visually overwhelming, and certainly brings out the AP even in the best of us. It's colorful and fun, and for me the submarine/bot scoring mechanism really has a feel of Terra Mystica, so I think that lends to my love of the game.

I found this game beyond dry and boring. It was supposed to be a highly thematic game by Feld, and normally, I love his games but this one really fell flat.  It was difficult to teach and there were a number of constraining mechanics like the game path you have to follow for different actions.  You can plan around this but it can be frustrating.  There are a number of ways to score, but I found it pretty awful.  I would rather play Trajan.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent Feldian Eurochurner with a piquant aftertaste.  A lot of the typical this-for-that, but it breaks down the 'this' into two steps.  In order to get your worker to do something, you first have to program him to do what you are going to want him to do.  I'm not sure that makes it better, but there are a few subtle, and I'm sure brilliant as well, tactics this brings out.  The theme may make this the qwirkiest of all Eurogames.  A sci-fi underwater world somewhat reminiscent of The Abyss screams more Ameritrash plastic than Octopode meeples.  A rich pasted on theme peels off all the faster.  Still, somehow it all kind of works.

January 16 2015. Finally received my kickstarter copy.

First playthrough was a two player game. I'm a Feld fan and this game did not disappoint. Like most recent Feld games you score many points in various ways. Its not a point salad but you can score lots of points. 

Instructions: Instructions are pretty easy to understand and well laid out. Pictures and descriptions are nice.

Cards: Cards are of decent stock and their layout is easy to comprehend. Cards take Fantasy Flight Red sleeves.

Gameboard: The gameboard is made up of various pieces and will change pretty much every time you play. The board pieces are nice and the layout is easy to understand.

Playerboard: The playerboard is made from vary flimsy card stock and could be torn very easily. 

Meeples: The meeples are nice and there are various types.

Problems: The only thing that would be nice to have would be a player aid describing what the various cards do and what each of the sector objects do, as well as intermediate and final scoring. This information is located in the instructions but player aids are always nice to have.

One of my favourite games by Stefan Feld; Aquasphere really (and surprisingly) stands out in terms of theme feel, because the game is really tight and claustrophobic like a submarine station should be. There's a lot of actions you can choose from, which is a Feld trademark, but in this game you are always forced to choose between very few of them each turn. Everything is linked, so every decision influences your gameplay for the rest of the game, timing is crucial because you just can't move up and down through the station, since you'll always be out of chronos.
To me, Aquasphere gives a really satisfying gaming experience, even with just 2 players.

This game is a typical "Feld-game". Shortage from the beginning till the end. You are always in struggle for want of time, ressources and possibilities. You have to plan forward-looking and anticipatory according to the lack of just everything. A very good game for people who wants to plan their moves ahead. The underwater-theme is nice-looking but hasn't got anything to do with the game itself.

Neat game. The presentation is exceptionally attractive, especially for a Euro. It's not hard to understand AquaSphere, but it is certainly hard to explain, and also hard to play well. I read somewhere that one needs to play it a couple times before they really learn how to play it with competence. I can believe that.

The duration of our first game was quite long. It took around four hours. I'm hoping that with subsequent plays the game length will come down considerably.

New Feld games are usually ambivalent experiences for me: admiration for the creativity bursting forth from a single brain is balanced, and sometimes overshadowed, by the niggling question whether a single brilliant game per year might not be more worthwhile than four or five merely good ones. It is somewhat telling that my favorite of his more recent output, Die Burgen von Burgund, was toned down in complexity during development.

Wishing for a bit more streamlining was my first reaction after reading the Aquasphere rulebook, but after my first and so far only play, I have the optimistic feeling that there is a depth to this game that justifies its many knobs and levers.

One indication for this is that, in contrast to a lot of his other games where you need to do a bit of everything to succeed, Aquasphere offers the opportunity of really focusing on one aspect of your engine. While none of us were able to fully capitalize on this in our first game, those with specific strategic goals did significantly better.

All in all, this will need more than just the one play to do it justice, and I'm looking forward to deeper exploration.

I am not a fan of worker placement games.  That being said, this game brings something interesting to the genre because the available actions are constrained so tightly by the robot programming and the time tokens that it is often possible to at least determine if another player will get a chance to beat you to the same action.  Better than average.

Pretty crunchy and interesting Feld. Maybe not quite as brain burning as people say, just visually intense and icon-heavy on the player mats. The AP gets a little relief at least, because of the scientist track, which limits the options that are available. I most enjoy the visual aspect that this board has, brilliant colors and spoke pattern reminds me of a kaleidoscope. That, along with the underwater scientist theme, really help this game to stand out for a euro game. At least it's not another square board with watercolor artwork. But the learning curve on this one is kinda steep, which will limit my desire to teach this to new players in the future.

Interesting game, but one play is not enough for a full judgement. It will be updated later. More tactical than strategic. Yes there is planning of your actions, but that doesn't mean that your gameplan can be programmed. It is quite interactive, so you might have to change your envisioned location to execute your programmed action. this also gives it an opportunistic feel. And the game is full of constraints. You need this, you need that. You can't do this, before you do that etc. The games I rate highest allow much freedom to the players. Otherwise it is grab a few points here and a few there, like we know Feld. Not sure if this has enough staying power in the long run, perhaps it lacks sufficient options for long term planning for my tastes, but it deserves more plays and I will update my rating here.

I like the concept of this game, but in practice I find it has a bad habit of incentivizing the player to agonize over planning far ahead. This has a tendency to either stress the player out because they know they are playing sub-optimally or force them into AP. This game reminded me of chess in that it has strong strategy and skill involved, but isn't necessarily that fun. My opinion might go up on future plays when I've mastered the game's many mechanics and have a better idea of what I'm doing.

Erste Runde auf der Messe war recht vielversprechend. Viele Aktionsmöglichkeiten und doch nicht chaotisch. Die Mechanismen greifen gut ineinander. Wenig Downtime. Eingängige Regeln. Nach La Isala und Amerigo spricht uns dieser Feld wieder deutlich mehr an!

Leider hat sich der zunächst gute Eindruck nicht mehr bestätigen können. Wir haben unser Spiel wieder verkauft. Die Möglichkeiten noch auf die Züge der Mitspieler zu reagieren sind nach der anfänglichen Planung sehr eingeschränkt. Daher kann es schnell frustrierend werden, wenn die Mitspieler sich anders verhalten als gedacht. Daher ist man geneigt zu versuchen bei der Planung alle Eventualitäten zu berücksichtigen, was sich aber entsprechend negativ auf die Spielzeit auswirkt. Ein paar gute Ideen aber dann in unseren Augen ein bisschen zu starr. Schade, hatte auf mehr gehofft.

I'm a Feld fan and this did not disappoint. It's very tight. I like the multiple steps to accomplish anything. It forces you to plan ahead and sometimes those plans don't come out as you'd hoped. It shares this aspect with Luna but in a coarser way. I like that the decision space on a given turn is very tight, as both the engineer and the scientist are limited to two choices. Planning ahead can still cause a little AP, and the inclusion of information about the next round can make that worse. But for those who don't get too caught up in it, it's a good, fast, puzzly game.

Meaty game that takes a little while to get the mechanics to click in your head.  Theme is non-existent but I don't buy Feld for theme.  Turns can go fairly quick once people understand.  As is typical, it seems simple to play till you look at the depth of choices.

Game with a theme, but a highly flawed theme that one doesn't feel for a moment during play. Once you start thinking about the theme, there are so many holes in it that it falls apart immediately.

Gameplay is okay, but not immediately clear what leads to victory - in that way not very Feldian. Limitations are great and focus must not lie with more than one or two aspects. 

Some parts (submarines) worth less / much more work than others (tiles).

First Stefan Feld game that I've ever played.  I'll have to see about 2 other of his games to see if I hate this game especially or whether I dislike Stefan Feld games.  

Lots of mechanics where points are possible for almost everything.  It's one of those games where if you do not get the same amount of points as everyone else, the differential will grow geometrically--making those in last place just bored by the end of the game.  

Didn't help that the rules were not explained well either.  

I'll never play it again.

Nagyon egyedi játék, semmi máshoz nem hasonlítható. Sokan Feld mestermunkájának tartják, de szerintem az inkább a Burgundy. Ez jóval szárazabb annak ellenére, hogy egyébként meg a víz alatti hangulat jól átjön és minőségiek a komponensek is (a polip például tényleg polip, nem egy másik színű fakocka).

Nem könnyű nulláról megtanulni, mert olyan mechanizmusokkal operál, amik más játékokban nem nagyon fordulnak elő. Emiatt döcögősen indul az első parti, de néhány lépés után, már adja magát (csak addig kell túlélni).

A gyémántok bevezetése igazi Feld-g.ciség, csomó pontot lehet bukni a hiányuk miatt.

Ami nagyon tetszik benne, hogy nem csak a tábla teljesen moduláris, de még az akciómezők is. Szerintem közel a végtelenhez közelíthet az újrajátszhatósága.

A folyamatos számolgatás, agyalás miatt nem könnyű és az égiek mentsenek meg egy igazi AP-s játékostól, mert akkor a másfél órás játékidőből is lehet simán duplája.

Annak azért nem ajánlom, aki még nem játszott keményebb euróval, mert kb. a szabálykönyv felénél belehal a sztoriba...

Good brain burner, interesting and agonizing decisions, very replayable. Personal taste but I love the color scheme and the overall quality.

There is some luck (cards, costs...) but it's not overwhelming. The real problem is that there's simply *too much* here: even after 10 plays we're still unsure if we have missed something: did I scored when I placed that submarine? does removing a programmed bot count as an action? Now I'll get that card - oh no I couldn't, I already have a card limit...and now how can I undo my move?!

All of this, to gain VPs. Why? Who knows (it's an euro, beauty). Mmh...

There seems to be a lot of depth in this game.. Lots of tough, interesting decisions to make.. The components and visual elements to the game is beautiful.. A real brain burner.. Typically can't do everything you want to do.. SO make sure you actions are not SUB-standard..      
Edit: After my second full game, my rating has to rise up from the depths.. Once you get your head around what the hells water is going on, there is so much depth, deep decisions to be made.. every shallow choice you make deeply affects the next wave of turns..   
Edit: Now played with all player counts and works well with all, maybe a little better with four but it does create more craziness and more to figure out in terms of predicting their moves.. This is a SOLID feld, close to being my favourite..   
THIS GAME IS OH SOOOO GOOD.. ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY IT

Objectively speaking, I think AquaSphere is Feld's best design to date. It's a true victory point salad, but it's also one where you can't ignore anything. If you ignore even one area of this game, you'll lose miserably. You have to dabble a little bit into everything, and ultimately you want to focus on one area to make the most of your points. It's tough to get to the table, however, or else it would be rated much higher.

UPDATE: I don't get to play games that often these days, and Aquasphere has little if any chance of getting back to the table. Despite its great design, I had to shift it out of my collection.

The main problem with the game is the theme : IT is there.
But then the mechanics don't make sense. At all.

What kind of lunatic engineer can't upload twice the same program on the exact same kind of multi-purpose robot ?
Or doesn't want to upload a squid fighting program because he programmed a submarine launch before ?
Oh, and he wouldn't like that there would be 3 robots set up a the same time. You may have 10 more 'bots doing nothing, if you've got already two programmed robots, he will re-program one of these.

And that's just one of the nonsense mechanics that absolutely doesn't fit the theme for me.
The two main others being the penalty for not fighting squids and the loading stations mechanism.

By no means poorly designed, but a rather miserable play experience... A few seconds of planning at the start of the round are followed by a half hour of what is essentially bookkeeping.

Want. Area majority is not my favorite mechanic, but he made it work. There's a sense of wonder to it, maybe because of the deep underwater research theme in conjunction with trying to figure out a coherent plan. It's Feld's typical X orthogonal actions (7 in this case) with minor interconnectedness, but not to the level of Asgard/Madeira/Bruxelles/Bora Bora

It's about some scientifics researching crystals in a submarine station. But as in all Felds, the theme is non existant. 

Game components are normal quality. I love the octopus meeples, even if they are not different enough from the robot meeples (except in colour). The main flaw of the graphic design is that some of the gameboard icons are WAY too small to be identifiable.

So, it's another "point salad", but in this case, unlike Bora Bora, the scoring elements are more interrelated and the provide more gaming possibilities.

The thing I like the most is the fluidity of the gameplay. It's a medium euro, and what the other players do will affect your actions, but still the game advances very fast, with almost no stops.

There are many variable elements to grant replayability, but they also make long term planning very difficult, if not impossible. They enourage adaptable strategies and tatics. It also includes some cool mechanics that can create interesting situations (ex: octopus costing you points).

I would only recommend it to Feld's fans and those who doesn't have a recent Feld game.

For a huge fan of Feld's heavier games, this one fires on all cylinders. It's a much tighter, often downright constricting experience compared to Trajan or Bora Bora, but the sweet addicting comboing is still there, and within one or two games the mechanics will flow like second nature. Definitely a welcome addition to my collection.

Update: I still enjoy this game. Whenever I feel the urge to play something like it, however, I end up going with Bora Bora instead. A game that is just as combo-y and interactive but handcuffs the player less than AquaSphere does.

Verdict:

What I Like: The game is rich with Feldian combo goodness. Actions that give more actions and can chain into pleasant strings of productivity. The theme is fun, although somewhat painted on. It's nowhere near multiplayer solitaire. The program/execute rhythm pleases me.

What I Don't Like: This game forces competency in every area: octopod slaughter, crystal acquisition, "time" chit management, bot area control, action mutiplication, sub placement, lab construction, etc. I wish for more freedom to abandon one of these aspects to better pursue another but often feel hamstrung. With such tight restrictions, ending scores feel arbitrarily close, and a last round mistake can doom despite prior dominance.

It just feels like a little too much different mechanisms thrown together without them ever falling into place for me. There is a lot to do and a lot to think about, but nothing that really captures me.

各種上限的限制導致資源永遠很缺
兩人時路線似乎比較少(潛水艇完全沒到六艘的必要)
不知道是人數關係還是確實沒有六艘的必要
規則:
*洗勻並抽四張編程卡(對應四回合)，將編程版塊照卡片放置在編程圖版上，然後移除該編程卡
*照玩家順序放一個機器人在編程圖版右邊數字，下面放工程師，分數放一方塊，左邊全圓記數放一方塊在0+
*2~3人將沒用的顏色潛艇放在供應區

*記分區每次過紅線要付一個水晶或是返還一個編程後機器人，如果都不要就不能過線，最後記分不需要考慮紅線
*周遭基地版塊中間是行動機器人放置區，下面是被移除的機器人，如果超過指定人數，則每個人只能保留一個，多的彈回個人圖版
*個人圖版，編程區最多同時兩個機器人，隨時可退回一編程機器人，並拿兩個時間
*擴展實驗室版塊可增加儲存上限，如果有字母可放一個機器人到該字母基地版塊控制區(可選擇要放或不放)
*進行四輪，每輪結束都有階段記分，第四個階段記分結束進入最後記分
*行動三選一
A 編程一個機器人 : 使用工程師編程或用三個時間編程(一輪一次，用完將時間放在個人圖版右上角指定位置來標記用過)
B 使用編程後的機器人行動: 移動工程師(付時間，可不動) > 放在該基地版塊想要的行動顏色區 > 對應該行動的編程機器人移動到控制區，並把之前的機器人踢到下方備用區 > 執行動作
C pass
*可執行行動
1.拿時間如果超過儲存上限多的不能拿，如果少於兩個，可從銀行補，至少兩個
2.抓章魚分數1-3-6-10-15-21，抓完放回供應區
3.每一個基地區只能有一個你的潛艇，支付對應時間，得中央燈泡分數
4.拿科技卡並拿中央燈泡分數，科技卡不能棄掉即使是一次性使用的

RATING: 9
One of my favorites from Feld. As in any of his games, Aquasphere can feel a bit bloated as there are whole sections of the board and "actions" a player can simply ignore. But that may be the heart of great game design: tough decisions. There may be issues with "flow" here; the programming and deploying of "bots" for a player's actions can feel disjointed and clunky at times. And, as always, you can't complete every objective and finish every track in a Feld game for a reason. But that doesn't stop me from trying. I'm forever on my quest to "complete" all of the objectives for a Feld game, even if it means I come in last place. In the end, Aquasphere may be indistinguishable from the rest of his victory point salad oeuvre but I think it's a great departure for Feld. I love the interlocking boards, the bot meeples and the theme is adorable. And it runs a bit faster than the rest of his games.

RATING: 8
Most Feldian games get a decent rating from me because they're polished and bring something new to the table. In this game, it's the action path (you can only do one of these two, then one of this next two, and then one of the final three) and the lookahead to next turn to see what action paths are available, and choosing this turn's action path to set yourself up to take best advantage of next turn's action paths. There's the usual salad of things to take advantage of, including techs (which will encourage you to over-do the action type it advantages), points for improving carrying capacity, points for spreading out across regions, insta-points, and the like. All of which provides a nice decision tree with enough race interaction to make it interesting but sandboxy enough that you can gain satisfaction from a plan coming together and executing well. Solid Euro that I'd like to play again to see if I can find a better balance between playing for the now and investing in the future.

RATING: 10
very different from other Feld games. it is very tight an tense, but it is not a "point salad".  the tension comes from the restrictions put on you by the game.  Every round is like a competitive puzzle that you want to work out better than your opponent.  it will throw you for a loop the first time you play it - even (especially) if you are a seasoned eurogamer. it takes time and multiple plays to get good handle on how to develop your path and what the best decisions are, because it is just so different from other euro games.  if you like very thinky, difficult puzzles, you will find this game rewarding.

This is just a prelimary rating. this IS a fine game, but also rather dry and confusing looking.
The 2 different boards to play on are fine. But all the scoring and possibilities to get points are too much for me. They surely proved to much for many players in our group.
I liked the few games under my belt but the game itself doesn't offer something "fresh".
I Will have to play this game more often before I can decide on the final rating. We will see how this goes.
Update (22/12/14): I raised my rating after 5 games. It finally clicked with me. The various possibilities and the gameflow are now clear, we play much better, without consulting the rulebook to much. but we rather are concentrating on our moves to make. Fine game that feels much more coherent than "Bora Bora" ever felt for me. The theme is still very dry and doesn't come through. That is a real shame.

So many icons everywhere will be your first thought and going through the rules it is fairly complex. Once you figure out the mechanics they are not so bad, but finding the best route to victory is. You move your engineer around to program robots who then perform tasks. You have a lot of choices and the ones you chose prevent you from obtaining other actions, so you can really regret a choice. One of those games that make it seem like you are doing terrible, so focus on maximizing points and fighting those in front of you as best you can.

Ahhhhhhhhhh so many good games have been coming out lately that I am giving so many 8s and above... This is no exception with an 8.5! Tom Vassel is sooo wrong about this game! Don't listen to him.  8/3/15

Ok, so I played another solo game today with 2 players. It needs 3 or 4 to work properly. I really wish designers would stop putting out 2-4 player games if one of those counts fails. Just say what numbers work. Now I think Feld has done some good things here with making things a bit more slappy/difficult. No he doesn't kill off you peeps like ItYotD but he does push off your bots and halt you from scoring VPs if you don't have those precious crystals. It is good to see him going back to his roots a bit here whilst mixing it up with his points salad. Still an 8.5 for me. 19/3/15

Update: rerated to an 8 from 8.5

RATING: 9
AquaSphere is a game about having your scientists and robots perform various tasks on an underwater research station. Essentially, the scoring boils down to trying to get your pieces (robots and submarines) off your player board and onto the main board and keep them there, but there are a number of other ways to score as well. Each turn, you can do one of two things: either use your programmer to train a robot to perform a specific task, or use your scientist to move to a section of the AquaSphere board and have a robot perform its pre-programmed task there. The programmer is constrained by a randomized track: he can only train three robots per round, and the choice of task limits the next task that can be trained. For scientists, tasks have different benefits in different parts of the station, but moving from one section to the next costs time tokens. Once a player uses a section of the station, his robot token is moved to the active space of that section; if that section is used again, the older robot is bumped to the loading area. Once the loading area is full, each player can only keep one robot there, and the others are returned to the players’ boards. At the end of each round, players score if they control a plurality of the six active spaces with their robots, but also lose points if sections controlled by their robots are infested with octopods. Additionally, they gain points for the number of robots no longer on their player board, but only if the corresponding submarine pieces have already been placed. Players can also gain tiles and cards that provide additional benefits. There are a ton of strategic options in this game, but also a ton of constraints in every direction. The game doesn’t hide much from you, right down to what will be available next round, so there’s a ton of opportunity for multi-turn planning. Trying to make everything work together was really a thinky and enjoyable experience for me.

I went into this game with no expectations. I've been pretty unimpressed with most Feld games. Bora Bora, Trajan and Bruges have been the only ones with any staying power for me. I can't stop thinking about this game. The turns are dead simple. Program a bot, use one or hard pass for the round. That's it. But what makes me continue to want to play this game is the decision space that unfolds. You need time to move places, you need crystals to advance in points, you want to watch for area control, submarines will get you time and you need both card upgrades and research lab upgrades.

For a game that overwhelmed me initially, it has started to open up after just my first play. It left me an empty husk of a person and I wanted more. I can't say enough great things about this game.

I got to play this game at my local meetup today and I am glad that I did.

This game is a typical Feld point salad which I like very much. It is complex but not AP inducing because you have few options when it comes to you and when other people are taking their turn you are churning in your brain your next move. The robot placement track limits what you can do and you need to think about what you want to do. I can say strategy probably weights more than tactics. I went for big end game bonus and I pull from dead last to 2nd place. There are many interlocking mechanisms in the game that might foil your plan when someone pump your robot off or take the things you need but you can pay attention to their robot placements to guess what they will want to do. Fun game for gamers but probably won't own since it's a bit complex.

This game is about examining little octopuses in an underwater lab. Wonderful theme. Much like other point salad games, you can't do everything you want to do, and even trying will ensure you fall far behind other players. It's somewhat hard to describe all the intricacies of the game, but in essence, it's got what I like in Felds, which is meaningful decisions, tension about being able to beat players to spots and about reacting when a player takes a spot from you. The area control aspect is very well thought out, and it's both possible to play predictably and unpredictably. I'm fond of it.

The board is busy...well, okay, the three boards you'll use are loaded with symbols, letters, arrows, and eventually meeples of submarines, robots, octopods, and scientists.  It is pretty intimidating at first.  Then you see that there's really only a few actions you can take, and that there's only five rounds.  So, you figure the decisions have got to be weak or that the game runs on autopilot.  Not so, either.  
The thing about Aquasphere is that it defied my expectations at every turn.  It is (after some acclimation) quite simple, fast playing and strongly evocative of the theme.  Genuinely enjoyed this one.

 Imagine if you had to juggle a dozen different things. Some things improve your ability to do other things. Some things give you more points. Some things are currencies you need to advance in points, other things will earn you points and possibly earn you more points, and possibly keep you from losing points. Now imagine that depending on your actions, you'll either get a certain amount of points, or another amount of points, or maybe that thing you did that would seem smart at the time turned out to not earn you very many points. What if that thing that seemed important in the first round turned out to not be important at all in the other three rounds?

Welcome to Aquasphere, a four round game wherein you try and acquire the most knowledge (read: generic VP) in your underwater laboratory. Just like in real life, you have to fight off/capture ravenous octopods all the while trying to deploy your army of roboslaves to get that sweet... science done?

In essence, this is a juggling match of dry euro proportions, complete area control, pseudo-worker placement, combos, and all sorts of wooden bits. If the corn in Tzolk'in was too much for you, the time tokens and octopods might tickle that same trouble spot. In theory you can play optimally and get a Euro experience, but there's so much to keep track of and so many ways to earn and lose points, that it's hard to give this a nod of approval.

Egyenlőre kicsit kusza, de érdekes mechanizmus. Bár talán nem is a mechanizmus egyedi, hanem annak megvalósítása. Gyakorlatilag a köröd elején meg kell tervezni a teljes körödet, hogy mit mi után cselekedj, és ne kerüljön annyi időbe, illetve az ellenfél se túrjon ki, idő előtt. Ketten játszottunk és fölényesen nyertem, de szerintem csak a jobb szabályismeretemnek köszönhettem. Interakció van egy kicsi, inkább az akciók választásának idejében lehet variálni, illetve hogy előbb vidd el a kiszemelt portékát. Vannak akciók amiket előbb érdemes végrehajtani, és vannak amiket később. de ezt mások is így láthatják így abból konfliktus is keletkezhet. Gyakorlatilag a következő körödet is meg kell tervezni, és ott és annyi idővel, kővel programozott robottal kell a kör kezdetén rendelkezned, amivel végre is tudod azt hajtani.
Szóval sok újdonság nincs benne, de érdekes téma és kivitelezés design elviszi a hátán. Korrekt munka, de semmi egyéb.

Pros:
1. This game is a legitimate brain burner.
2. Lot of decision points.

Cons:
1. So many decision points that a lot of times it feels like just guessing what needs to be done.
2. Just too much going on.
3. No theme

Summary: This is a Feld game and it shows. I generally enjoy his designs and this is no different. It's a good game, but he has much better ones that don't feel as overwhelming. The theme issue is typical with his games, but usually I like his game enough to just ignore the lacking theme.

Wow! This game was a very pleasant surprise. I love Stefan Feld game but was content with the ones I have and didn't have plans to pick up any of the others. I had looked at this game once and thought it looked overly complicated and busy and the rule video I was watching bored me and I just walked away from the game. When the chance came up to get it really cheap I looked for another video to watch and found that "Watch it Played" had since made a video for the game. After watching the video I was confused at why it seemed I had misread the game so bad last time. After playing the game I was very impressed with the simplicity of the turns and the solid mechanisms at work during the game. Love the unique way you select your actions and also the way you can activate bonus actions and the perfect time to potentially take multiple turns at once. Yes, Feld is very good at this but it never gets old, for me at least. There is a lot more to love here so just go out and try the game.

Now this is a real clockwork... I enjoy it more and more. Still not sure if it surpasses "Bora Bora", only time will tell.

After a dozen of plays I can write a bit more. (Disclaimer: all games were 2p games.) This is a very, very tight game, even for Mr. Feld! The game often ushers you to some actions, mainly because of the black crystal mechanic (you need them to be able to score). Sure, there are options aplenty, especially in the beginning, but after you dedicate yourself to a certain strategy, it's more about executing it in the most efficient way than about freedom of choice. In many ways, this is similar to "Bora Bora", where the goal tiles often force the moves on you - because it's always more profitable to create your strategy on the basis of the tiles than ignoring them altogether. But in "Aquasphere", actions feel even tighter - you have less of them, their availability is predetermined AND you need the currency to pay for them (time). In result, it's a game of constraints. If you don't enjoy this style of games, you won't enjoy "Aquasphere".

Basically, it's a puzzle. The most efficient way of getting points is already set before you even start playing - you just need to figure it out and follow it from the beginning till the end. Personally, I enjoy it, but I understand why others would not.

One of the best Feld games to date. There is always too much to do and not enough time. Doesn't feel as point-salady as some of his other titles, if that's not your thing. I really like the bot programming mechanic and the constant threat of running out of time or opponents stealing your hard earned actions. Others may not see it, but I think there is a decent amount of theme here. The under water station is dripping with color and style. Gorgeous to look at, but even more fun to tinker with. Can't wait to play again.

I've played this four times so far - three times in January 2015 (one 2p and two 3p), more times than I usually play a new game in the first month, and one 4p game in May. Sadly I've not managed to get a game in since, but I really like it so far, and think it's among Feld's best games - although for most of the first play you've really got no idea what you're doing, you can start to make plans by the end of it, and then hopefully from the start of subsequent games. I really enjoy the way you always have to carefully consider the timing of your moves, and that you have a little bit of freedom to perform the actions of bots in a different order from the one you programmed them in - but not a lot. I don't see this ever being popular with the great mass of BGG users, but it's a very good "gamer's game". And - as always with Feld, but it bears repeating - very different from everything he's done before.

(+) Colorful game with nice components. A rather nice feature, certainly if you take into account this is a Feld game.
(+) Offers some interesting mind bending decisions in a surprisingly short gamespan
(+) Very clever system with the majorities. You can score points by obtaining majorities, but sometimes this is risky business when the Aquasphere is compromised with octapods. It is perfectly possible to score well without paying much attention to area control or majorities.
(+) Many paths to victory. You can try different strategies, but the game also allows for tactical opportunistic play in which the player with a good overall plan, but with enough flexibility to snatch away good opportunities which often present themselves will turn out victorious

(-) AP prone
(-) Some people don't like the fact that the game has mechanics which very much limit your possibilities. Although I like the vast freedom some games like 1830 or Civilization offers, this sort of rule set which is classic in a Feld game do make for a more structured, balanced and much shorter game which remains interesting.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Make a good assessment of the board at the start of the first round (tech cards, lab upgrades and your starting action) in order to determine a strategic line for your game. If not more than one opponents follows this line, stick to it and maximize it as good as possible. If two or more opponents also follow this same strategy, it might become problematic to persue it: changing strategy is well possible until the second round. Making good opening moves (getting the right tech cards, lab upgrades or getting submarines out quickly together with placing multiple robots) is very important!
(*) Next to having a greater 'stategic plan' to persue, always keep your eyes open for good tactical opportunities which arise all of the time in this game.
(*) Don't underestimate the power of white 'programming' actions: they offer much needed flexibility (especially for players with enough time to travel to the desired sector) get 2 robots out in stead of only one! What's more, they can allow you to continue playing in a round in which opponents have allready passed.
(*) When you are late in turn order (or you have much time to spend), it might be worth your while trying to obtain control over the aquasphere. Otherwise, don't pay too much attention to the area majority aspects of the game, as control over different sectors will change rapidly and control over multiple sectors often comes at the cost of penalty points due to squids invading the Aqua Sphere.
(*) Sectors next to the expensive '2' door often prove to be a little bit more stable, as they will likely be visited less often by players. Sectors next to the '0' door are often the most dynamic ones.
(*) Keep an eye out for what new resources will enter play in the next round. Take this into account when deciding whether to pass or to continue playing.

RATING: 7.5
Feld's output in 2013 was rather average IMO, with the swingy Bruges, and the lacklustre Rialto. 2014 sees him catering much less disastrously to the light, with La Isla, and here the medium weight genre.

That's right, because Aquasphere is not as heavy a game as Bora Bora was - it is much more similar in my view to Luna, in term of weight and gameplay, where planning ahead is essential, yet, remains opportunistic and tactical in nature.

That said, while there is a lot to like in Aquasphere, much of it is reminiscent of earlier designs, featuring the usual penalty for letting things out of hand, and shortage of actions to do all one would need to execute their plans to their full extend.

Still, I think Aquasphere is his best design of the last couple of years, and the setting being less tired than most euro games out there, it's a likely candidate to introduce to people allergic to the 'trading in the mediterranean' kind of games.

The more I play it, the more I like it.

The scoring is a bit fiddly (add/subtract all the points and then move the marker). I love the art and the components. There are four rounds, and you can only see what choices are available this round and the next round; this game is about tactical efficiency - make the most out of the choices available at the time.

Another Feld point salad game with multiple ways to score points based on multiple actions. 

The artwork and theme look cute on the box, the game in play is very visually busy (almost distracting).  The main offender is the challenge to determine who has majority control of the "AquaSphere".  Players will be making moves about this hard to resolve at a glance game state.

Otherwise it is another game of limited options (programming bots) to get limited developments to get victory points.  An OK game, but much prefer Trajan by the same designer for that sort of multiple points to victory game.

RATING: 8
Similar feeling of constraint as in Year of the Dragon, but whereas in that game it is because of the (almost) unrelenting sequence of disasters, here it is because of the difficulty in planning and putting into effect a do-able sequence of actions. I've only played with two so far, but I imagine a four-player would make forming a winning plan even more elusive. Nevertheless, Feld at his most clever.

RATING: 4
I liked the game early on, but by the end I was really ready to stop.  There was a lot of down time, often paired with very short turns.  Very little gets done on a single turn, and you can end up waiting a lot while others puzzle out their moves.  I had some 5 second turns with 5-10 minute waits in between, which go old pretty quickly.

I liked trying to fight the system to get tasks done and avoid octopods, but only when I actually got to take my turns rather than just sit around and wait.

I also found the graphics pleasing and adequate, but slighly confusing and misleading and hard to parse.  There were also just enough little rules that I found people were frequently missing something and disrupting the already slow flow of the game, and which certainly weren't made memorable from thematic cohesion.  The game was just an abstract combination of stuff, which neither made thematic sense or formed a pleasing or elegant structure.

This is an interesting game with a lot of strategic decisions. However, the scoring is weird. There are times when you earn points but you can't score them. Frustrating. And you may do better than an opponent in an area like building your lab but you score less because their lab sections have different alphabetical letters on them. Random.

Just know this before you start.

 Played it again and I gotta say that this in my top 3 Feld games. This game is an absolutely incredible and elegant design. It's really very simple to play, the rules make it less accessible than it needs to be, but for the most part they're not bad. I love how quick turns technically can be, but they won't always be that way due to the insane amount of planning required. Beautiful components, bright colors, and plays beautiful with 2 with the neutral subs and reduced area control count. This game is really one of Feld's best designs.  This is a gamer's game, through and through, and honestly am shocked as to why it isn't in the top 100 bgg list. It has a very steep mastery curve, and maybe that's why. You will not start appreciating it's true beauty in the first couple of plays.

Another really good Feld here. It doesn't beat Trajan, and maybe not even ahead of Bora Bora, but right up there close.

AquaSphere gives that great sense of tension of wanting to do more than you are able, but enjoying the anticipation and planning the stuff that you can do. The bot programming forces you to plan ahead, and like other Felds, chaining actions (or at least earning additional actions) will help win. Everything fits together nicely, from the lab expansions to getting rid of the octopods and picking up the black crystals.

I have really enjoyed all plays with my wife so far. I'm not sure if adding another player or two will make me enjoy it even more or make it seem too busy and crowded. It's a winner for me regardless.

There's nothing about this game that I don't love.

RATING: N/A
My early impressions are I'm ambivalent about the programming mechanic. Despite what some have said, this is not a game about programming robots. What the game calls programming is really just getting "permission" to do an action before actually doing it. It's a planning step. You can get permission for (program) at most two different actions (robots) before you start acting upon (deploying) them. Mechanically, it creates a delay between declaring and implementing an action, and in that very short time it's possible someone might do something to force you to adapt your plans, but is it likely? I don't know if this mechanic has a big enough effect to warrant the complication it adds. We'll see!

A great programming game by one of my favorite designer. The game varies a lot due to your position, and the cards/lab parts that are available for purchase. There are many paths to victory but your turn goes relatively fast as there aren't too many choices you can make on your turn. You must find the best choice among those limited choices, just like every other Feld's game. Really enjoyed this and looking forward to playing more.

There's a lot of custom components and pretty colors in this game, but at the end of the day, it's a Feld game.  There are a bunch of things you can do in this game to score points but you are constantly struggling to puzzle out how you can do them and you are forced, to some extent, to dabble in everything in order to try and specialize in one thing.  The game takes variable setup to a whole other level and while it is balanced, you almost have to wonder if it's TOO balanced.

This is one of my favorite Stefan Feld games. The artwork/component quality are awesome and seem to deviate from Feld's other works. If you look for them, there are definite nods to Star Wars in this game that takes place deep underwater (e.g. R2D2 look-alike bot on the cover and millennium falcon shaped puzzle pieces that make up the game board). This rulebook for this game can be intimidating and there is a lot to consider when performing intermediate scoring (e.g. needing a black crystal to advance on the score track beyond specific intervals guarded by laser beams, eliminating octopods from areas you control to avoid point deductions, etc.) but the game play becomes very smooth as you become more familiar. There are many paths to victory in this game and I actually really enjoy the programmed actions mechanism in this game. I thought I would hate it like I did with Lords of Xidit, but it is done in a completely different way here that works! If you like Feld games and want a challenge, pick this one up! It goes on sale from time to time on Coolstuffinc.com for $19.99!

For me, one interesting thing about this particular game is how readily the rules seem to "stick" with me.   I have other games by the same designer and if I pull them out, even after just a couple of weeks after the last play, I am at a loss to remember the important details of how to play and I have to pore over the rule book.   With this game, I've put it away, played other games for a few weeks as divergent as Fleet Commander: Nimitz, Kanban, Panamax, Xia: Legends of a Drift System.   Then, I came back to Aquasphere assuming that the other games I played wiped out my remembrance of the Aquasphere rules.   No.   I set up the game and was into it immediately.   The rules make "sense" it seems more so than other Feld games.  Also, I have little need to refer to the rulebook while playing this game.  I don't know if that is a recommendation for this game but I appreciate that aspect.

Decent game, but not quite as awesome as some of his other titles. I do think that the theme is interesting, even if it is mostly pasted on. I like the challenge of basically enabling the ability to perform actions and then later actually take them, although this two-step process is still not quite enough to take this to the upper tier of games.

1 play, 2er

An interesting Feldian game, but different from many of his others in that this one, to play well, seems to require a good deal of forward planning: look at the sequence of available actions this round AND the next, and the board configuration, then make a plan about which actions you should take. A bit more planning than I like, actually. But otherwise the game is pretty solid -- hence a '7' rating for now.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
- The main (circular) board is made of several sectors in a random configuration. Players place their Scientist token in one sector (determined by random tile).
- In the center, place a hex for the appropriate player count, one for each of the 4 rounds (stacked). Seed the board with octopods, subs, and time counters according to the center tile.
- A separate board, showing the 7 possible actions (in random configuration, based on a random setup card), is placed nearby. Also display next round's setup card. Players' Engineer tokens go in the bottom space.
- Players each get a personal programming tile, with places for all their robots; 2 go on specific programming positions based on their random starting position on the main board. They also get a lab tile showing their current ability in various areas (octopod killing, time counter collection, research, etc.).

On your turn, do one of the following:
- program a bot by moving your Engineer one space on the programming board (follow the arrows); max 2 programmed bots at any time (if you get a 3rd, immediately return one to it's home space and collect 2 time chits)
- use a bot:
... move your Scientist to a sector of the board, place it in the appropriate (and empty) action space. Pay the appropriate time chits, depending on your path on the board.
... move the bot from your programming board to the center of the sector, displacing any bot already there. The displaced bot goes to the holding area (if space runs out, max one bot/player there -- extra returned to player)
... the actions allow you to kill octopods in the sector and earn VP, collect 2-5 time chits, acquire a lab expansion or research card, etc.
- pass

After everyone passes, do end of round scoring: earn time chits based on the subs you have out, and score VP for various things (crystals collected, bots off your board, etc, less VP for octopods in sectors you control). In this game, _whenever_ acquiring VP, must pay a crystal (or return a programmed bot to supply) to cross various thresholds. Then, reset the main board and the lab board according to the tile/card.

After 4 rounds, score end-game bonuses for a variety of things (e.g., completely expanded lab). Most VP wins.

RATING: 6
First off, I've heard multiple people express their interest in the game because they enjoy the "programming" mechanic that this is being advertised as having.  There isn't really any programming in this game so if that had you most intrigued, you should maybe hold off until you get to try it or at least see it played.

What this is is pretty much a straightforward worker placement/victory point salad game.  I was intrigued by the "programming" mechanic myself going in but was more intrigued by the name Stefan Feld.  This certainly feels like a Feld game, it could only feel more-so if somehow they had incorporated dice.

In the end though this one left me feeling a little empty.  I'm not going to pretend that Feld's games are the most thematic, I mostly play them for the absolutely brilliant mechanics, although I do think some of them do have a certain thematic feel.  This one felt like it had no soul whatsoever and on top of that none of the mechanics felt new or original, it really did feel like a completely straightforward worker placement game and that just isn't going to cut it nowadays with the field so crowded with a hundred others just like it.

The game is played by the headquarters mat having the different action tokens placed on it in a different order based on the draw of a card.  Players will move a meeple across these tokens to "program" their robots, which essentially just means choosing the action that robot will perform.  A player can have up to two robots programmed at once.  The other option is to carry out the action of a programmed robot.  This is done on the main board.  A player has another meeple they can move around the main board and perform the programmed action in the location of their choice.

Each of the actions has some way of improving the players abilities or giving them victory points.  There is also a very light area control element as well.  As I said, this has been done before.  There's nothing new or very crunchy to this, it's just fluff.  Although I will add it is very pretty fluff.  The game is bright and colorful with solid pieces, a well-cut modular board, and cute little robot and octopus meeples.

I also think this game is worst with 2 players.  Many games like this don't really work well with 2 because competition suffers.  There is simply too much board and players tend to keep to themselves.

Not sure how I feel about this game yet. The game just seems very opaque about what it wants to accomplish.

Graphics manage to be garish without giving any sense of theme. Nevertheless another interesting design from Feld. The action selections are what makes his games, the point scoring what unmakes them (for me).

what I particularly liked about the game was the ability to deny supplies to other players by burning time chits (to create bots), it creates some interesting timing dilemmas.

This rating is based on my first play of the game.  If found the game to be very cluttered in a lot of the things that were going on.  I found it took me more than half the game to really get a handle on what exactly what was happening.  Once we did have it down, then the turns were much faster, but there is just so much going on that it is a bit prone to AP.  The symbology of the game is very confusing sometimes which also affects my overall feel of the game.  Would I play it again?  Perhaps.  Would I ask to play it?  Probably never.

Feld's first game through Hall Games was about a moon cult; this one is about octopus-hunting submariners. Renaissance cube trading, pshaw.

Players control scientists running around an underwater research station, setting off pre-programmed robots to perform actions in its different sections. Robots can (generally) be programmed only three times in each round, so actions are limited. 

There are a number of ways to score points, but the key driver for interaction is that the most recent player to take an action in a section has control; the player with control of most sections scores bonus points at the end of the round. But an octopus infestation in a controlled section is worth negative points, players can only advance past each 25-point interval by spending a crystal, and there are various options for permanently improving capability. There are too many good options!

Like Luna before it, AquaSphere is heavy for Feld. Timing/competition for majorities is particularly good, though I have some concern that it rewards being last in turn order, a position usually held by the player able to perform the most actions, which in practice is a case of the rich getting richer. Graphic design is tolerable, but some elements are tiny and difficult to see (icons on white actions, upcoming programming card).

Random elements undeniably significant. Major changes between rounds to available cards/sections makes long-term planning challenging. 

It's OK.

Very low luck involved in this game.  The area control is nice, as well as the theme.  The board is beautiful and so colorful.  

In this one you butt heads a bit more than in other Feld games because it is all about area control.  It seems that every move is undone by another person being smarter than you.  Then on your turn, you best them again.  

There is lots of planning involved.  You can plan quite far into the future, if you have the brain for it.

Overall it is a very enjoyable game if you like Feld, but want a different flavor.

I'm not certain why this game hasn't been received very well; perhaps because Tom Vasel gave it a poor rating?  I put it on par with Trajan, or at least very close to Trajan, and Castles of Burgundy.  In fact, I think it fits snugly between the two for a place in the top 3 Felds.  The complaints related to complexity of the game I think are way overblown.  The mechanics of the game are quite simple, but options abound.  The game rewards good planning and game play, and it punishes poor play. And there is no individual randomness.  If you enjoy "whomever rolls 6 first wins," this isn't the game for you.  If you're a fan of Terra Mystica, Caverna, and/or certainly Trajan, you really should give this a try.

Yes, I'm a bit of a Feld fanboy. I'm not ashamed of that. Some people don't like his games, and that's OK, but I don't see why being a fan of his is looked down on by some. End rant :)
Each time he creates a new game we wonder what the new clever mechanism is going to be. There's no big central innovative mechanism in this game that stands out like in most of his big games of previous years. But that's not a problem at all. This game combines a whole bunch of things that aren't all that new in and of themselves but it's all done a bit different. The way in which you program your future moves is quite neat and a nice challenge to master.
I must say that even though I didn't do well at all, I quite enjoyed this game.

Good, but not a great. I'd certainly play again, but I'm not going to suggest it. I enjoy the planning ahead and the puzzley AP moments when trying to balance money, actions, and robot placement. In fact, I do enjoy the game quite a bit, but in comparison to other games of the same ilk, the drawbacks are more intense.

The game is difficult to teach. It is harsh to new players and may frustrate or require severe turn back-tracking because of the multiple steps and payments involved in choosing certain actions. I enjoy programming the robots, but i don't enjoy placing them for the correct benefit, or having to weigh 4 different possible negatives (octopods are negative points, door costs, sub costs) with each placement, nor do I like the WILD combo. It makes for a grand puzzle, but it feels way too abstract and forced. 

The robots should be plastic minis.

In typical Feld tradition, there are lots of ways to score points in this one. There's a lot of advance information provided, which helps add some strategy to the tactical choice presented throughout the game. I feel like the basic mechanics of this one are pretty easy to grasp, but perfecting your strategy is pretty challenging. Like most Felds, the variable setup really helps to extend the replayability of this one. Finally, I think the length of this game is just about right. Experienced players can get through a 2p game in less than an hour, and a 4p game is doable in 90 minutes.

First Impression:
A heavy mathematical euro with pretty components.

Lots of strategy with variable paths and multiple mini-goals, as well as tight management and plenty of opportunities of scoring make this a classic Feld game, though significantly heavier than usual. Still, mechanics wise this might be one of his best games for deep strategy lovers.

The theme initially makes an impression, but gradually fades away as the game progresses. The game is way too mathematical for my taste, and players are expected to count their way to victory. There is no thematic intuition generated from the game, and all players do in their turns is count which of the available actions generates more vps. This can lead to extensive analysis paralysis in an already complex game. Other than that, I had the impression that the turn order favors slightly the first players, but I need more plays to verify it.

Overall, it seems like a good game for heavy euro gamers. I'd like to play again, but I'll be very carefoul with who. This is a kind of game that many gamers (even eurogamers) will really dislike.

Aquasphere was pretty much everything I expected it to be. A dense game that's hard to parse (I mean that in the best possible way), and clearly something that most of my groups won't like at all...

It's got a lot going on, and figuring out how to do well in the game is fairly opaque at the outset. Considering that your only options on a turn are "program a bot" and "use a bot" (or pass if you're done for the round), that's fairly impressive. There's a lot of ways to score points, and there's quite often a bind in being able to get, and/or possibly store, the things you need.

I like that it makes you think and that there's a lot to consider. This is a game I'd love to sink my teeth into and explore deeply. Unfortunately, it's just not the type of thing that is going to be exciting to many players in my group. And I know I could probably prevail upon some players who don't like this sort of thing and they'd obliging play it, at least a time or two, but I really hate asking people to play a game when I know "meh" is the best possible response I can hope for. I'd rather play something they enjoy instead.

It was somewhat of a pain to start this Feld game: the set up takes a good deal of work. The explaining wasn't the shortest one also, since several mechanism works in this game. This one seems to be way lighter in the "everything gives points" department, being closer to [thing=25554][/thing] than to [thing=84876][/thing]. [thing=159508][/thing] has some not so light punishment mechanism with the negative points given by leaving squids in the sections you control, and a way tougher cost by passing through some thresholds on the points track (you need to pay one crystal or one programed bot or you will simply won't be able to pass, losing all the points that would take you beyond the line!). Our play wasn't too long (around 2 hours and something), but it did leave space for some major AP (I almost froze sometimes), since they are so much to consider and a lot of restrictions: in time/knowledge (money), in resources available, in timming, in programing the bots, and other things.

It isn't exactly too tense or mean among players - if you have an action programmed, and other player don't, you will amost always be able to do the action before this player (barring some issues with sections and time/money) - but this go both ways, so if you are behind, there is little to be done except hoping the other player has some other priority. There isn't too much blocking, normally, what I wanted to do, I did. This don't mean that I did everything I wanted to do, as the game has several restrictions (in the way programming works, due to how big is your lab, and, as mentioned, due to place in the board - also considering the bots in the displacement area) and time/money to move). There are even more things to ponder in the game: the lab parts you want to add, the developments (cards) you want to take, the best way to get points with your bots and time/knowledge/money from your submarines (the submarines cap the amount of points the bots working in the station give to a player). 

[thing=159508][/thing] is a complex game, with a LOT of room for strategy - planning is a must not only in the round itself, but all the way through the end of the game - several things you will he hard pressed to be able to achieve unless you are going for them from the start of the game (like building a complete lab, or putting all the submarines in the board). It is also very important to be aware of the positions of the programming for the next round - do not forget to take a closer look to the positions.

And I enjoyed this aspect (the strategy throughout the whole game) pretty much, but, consering only this play, it is around the level of preference I have for [thing=66505][/thing], [thing=102680][/thing], [thing=136888][/thing] and [thing=84876][/thing], and behind [thing=25554][/thing], [thing=55670][/thing] and [thing=91873][/thing]. For complexity level, it is ahead most of these, being around [thing=102680][/thing], and above all the others I listed.

The components are good to excellent - lots of cardboard and wood bits, all colorful and well made. The bad part is the flimsy player boards, which are done in the same way (thickness) as the ones that comes in [thing=84876][/thing].

Good game but not his best.  This game would never replace Castles, Trajan or Bora Bora.  Complicated with lots of moving parts with many difference interactions and mechanisms. Definitely hard to teach game to newbies. Would play again but not sure I need to own it. Must play further to test theory that adding more time capacity at beginning of game is the dominate strategy to win. So maybe broken

First impression: As expected, quite complex, takes more than a round or two to really grasp how to make strategies. The "crystals or you can't score" mechanism is quite tricky, really. With that and with the very crucial time marker currency, you have to build a foundation from the start while also trying to find advantages elsewhere. Yes, tricky. We think we're going to like it a lot. 

Couple more games: Runaway victories do seem to be a problem. But the pace of it is nice--quick turns for a think-y game; the back and forth between navigating the headquarters and lab boards is intriguing and fun. But it's like a spinning top that goes along smoothly and then suddenly slightly touches something and starts to skitter unpredictably all over. Also--I keep losing!

This is very similar to Trajan in that you have a series of minigames chained together by a central mechanism.  In this case, it's the two different workers interacting.  Unfortunately, Trajan has a much better central mechanic.  Moving the programmer up the board is just lame.  I like planning out my turn from the beginning and optimizing, but once you figure out those base decisions the game is just meh.  It's very hard to do anything in this game.  It's slow and doing things is unrewarding.  In Trajan, you have off turns and on turns, but the optimization is just simply more fulfilling.  YMMV as with all felds, for me this one was sold immediately.

RATING: 5
I'm not a huge fan of Stefan Feld's games, and I'm growing a little tired of the current vein of Euro games, so I'm probably not the right audience for this particular title.  It's another in a long line of "There's nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't excite me, either" games.  On the plus side, I can attest that you can get off to a ridiculously slow start (I had 2 points to my opponent's 21 at the end of the first round) and still have a chance to win the game, so there's that.

In addition, the game is visually overwhelming to me.  There are lots of colors and tiny icons used to convey a lot of information, and the illustrations tend to get in the way of the functionality of the game.  I think it would become a little easier to comprehend with further plays, and while I wouldn't turn down a game of it, I'm not sure I'd ask to play it, either.

I think Feld was pulling a Friedmann Friese style gaming gag with this one. There are about 3 or 4 completely unrelated mechanics smashed together into an absolutely ridiculous theme. There's action programming, worker placement. area majority and the usual Feldian trademark of planning big combo turns to maximize scoring.

I'd say it's competent, if somewhat obtuse. Certainly not as fun as his last few releases, nor as engaging. I'm not sure if that's a result of the weird theme or just general Feld fatigue. I'll need a few more plays to decide its place in the Pantheon.

3.7 - Very good game. Awesome crunchy combos. Very tactical. Long term plans and the willingness to change plans once or twice over the course of the game are necessary. After a few plays you get used to the busy board. Nice primary colours. Top Feld right now, better than Trajan!

I don't really know what to think about this one. It has some interesting concepts and really clever mechanisms, but overall I find it to be too restrictive. I wouldn't call it a bad game by any means, it's a neat puzzle, but I have to say that I would rather spend 1,5 h playing some other Stefan Feld designs instead.

Has Feld finally jumped the Octopod?

While I am normally a Feld fan (although I also did not like Amerigo), Aquasphere seems like a convoluted mess.  Wheels upon wheels to turn, with no sense to be made from any of them.  On top of that, the game was not engaging at all.

Probably the most Feldian Feld and this, unfortunately, plays against the game. Feld is a master of scoring mechanics but, for my tastes, he should use 10 scoring mechanics for five games, not all in one single game.
In AS there are tons of ways to score points, every single one intricately interwoven with the others (without much help from an inevitably pasted-on theme, not that i despise pasted-on themes, being a Knizia fun at heart).
I struggled a lot just to figure out what to do to start gaining point, even if the game itself flows quite well. There are too many details to keep in mind and all in all the game is too overwhelming.
The black cristal mechanics for advancing with points is great!

Love this game - always want to play again. It's like an interactive interlocking puzzle with just the right amount of player interaction for me. Other players moves do affect you a bit but they don't totally block you. The game doesn't overstay its welcome or feel like you've run a full-length brain marathon by the end whilst still being very strategically engaging.

Deep sea research station. Teams of scientist/engineer pairs coexist in the facility to make the most advances in ocean research. Pure euro worker placement to deploy subs, collect crystals, and kill octopods. The trick of the game is to coordinate and time the engineer's reprogramming of robots for the correct use needed by the scientist. With many avenues to pursue, it is vital that you focus and build on your early area of specialty. This one is too much of a brain burn for my game group.

Pretty complex Feld, brain-burny. Lots of opportunities to score points with a few opportunities to lose them. The Engineer/Scientist interaction is pretty unique and I like the variability in setup. It does kind of feel like a bunch of stuff thrown together though, especially the score-gating crystal mechanic. It kind of feels like a random thing to make scoring more difficult and provide another action to take.

Since there are so many moving parts it would definitely take 2-3 games to form a solid opinion.

What an excellent game.  The game is very strategic, tense, and full of choices.  I love this game because there are so many paths to explore and the game has a tension of always lacking in some resource be it time, crystals, technologies, upgrade spaces, and more.  The game is VERY thinky and open to over analysis.  I think that is why the game is so enjoyable to me.  There is competition in the aquasphere between opponents who are pursuing the same paths to victory.  One of the key aspects to this game is using your engineer well and making the correct choices with him.  Extra actions are also vital because the more actions you have the more likely you will be able to achieve your goals.  One of the best games that I have ever played!

This is a solid Euro game all about forming a plan and executing it.  The way the engineer piece moving effects what you can do with your scientist piece from turn to turn which is pretty interesting.  There is certainly more in each round to do than you can get accomplished and the scoring feels a bit more integrated than some Feld games like Trajan because you need your robots in place (or off your board) for almost all of it.  There is even a bit more interaction than just "Hey you took the thing I wanted!" thanks to the majority scoring and used robot displacement.  Still... for all that its not something I feel I need to own after the first play as I own a lot of middleweight Euros and this doesn't feel significantly different even if it is  neat.  I'd still like to play again sometime if I get the chance.

Finally there is another complex Stefan Feld game. The complexity of this one could be compared to Luna, Bora Bora or Trajan. First question after playing the game, is it as good as one of those three games? The answer can be short. No, it isn’t. While playing, it gives you a certain Bora Bora feeling. But without the neat dice system Bora Bora has. In Aquasphere you can’t manipulate anything. Someway it reminded me also to Amerigo, a Feld game we didn’t like. Maybe because of the area control element that both games has. While I’m typing this, I realize that I’m comparing the game to other games. That means that the game isn’t a refreshing one. No new mechanisms in the game, but all are lend from other Feld games. Also this means, that the theme makes no sense at all. Of course that’s the case with a lot of Euro-games, and thus with games designed by Stefan Feld.

No new, refreshing mechanisms in the game….. Is Feld losing his touch? I’m afraid I would have to say yes. For a couple of years it was the master for designing the new era of board games. Now he hasn’t surprised us anymore since the game Bora Bora (but is that a bad thing, because that game is published in 2013 and is only about 1½ years old).

Having these things said, it’s time for the verdict of Aquasphere. Well, it’s a great game. If you like the more complex games designed by Stefan Feld, you will like this one. But don’t expect a game that is giving you a wow-feeling. Nothing new inside the rules (which by the way are very easy, just like it should be in a complex Feld game).

RATING: 3.5
It felt like a parody of a Stefan Feld game. It was okay I guess. I didn't like how it was touted as being "programming" when it isn't programming at all. Programming is a linear list of sequential items you want to execute; except here you can do max 2 things with your dumb robots.    I would have much preferred it if I could choose 5 of 7 things I want to do, and program them in-advance, colonial style.  

I didn't understand area control in the game at all; nor why were doing all these actions. I ended up doing things because I could, not because it lead to some payoff.

Egy újabb érdekes Feld-játék. Nem is tudok hirtelen mit hozzáfűzni, annyira lesokkolt a setup és a szabálymagyarázat. :D

Aztán persze játék közben minden a helyére kerül és egy igazán eredeti eurós élménnyel leszünk gazdagabbak a kipróbálása után. Persze kell egy kis képzelőerő a csontszáraz mechanika mellé az élvezethez, de a változatos meeple-ök azért segítenek ebben. Összességében egy jó játék, mely így utólag nem is annyira nehéz, de ismeretlenül beleugrani nem ajánlott, nem az a könnyed szórakozás.

There are a lot of mechanics here, but I found the game too short to get into them. Sub placement needs to be your sole focus if you're going to get all of them on the table, and even then it's dependent on the other players whether you'll be able to do it. The red cards seemed to be semi-arbitrary as to which ones you would get, and more dependent on where your scientist was rather than the power they awarded.

Lots of neat stuff going on in the game, but not enough time in a play to truly appreciate the various elements.

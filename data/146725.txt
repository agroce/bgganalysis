This is a review of the base game and current digital application as of August 18th,2014. Please do not hate. (Crying is OK as is evidenced by many remarks)

I realize this set is called the 'Starter Box' or 'Base Game Set', but it should really be called a 'Demo'. There is very little to do with this basic game other than to showcase the old technology brought forward.

Upon opening the box, the figures are so tightly packed, that some are broken/bent before shipping out. I did not see a requirement for epoxy on the box. (Read it again - They were broken at the factory and during shipment!)

After syncing the pen (I know it is a stylus, chill out nerds!), I opened the app to see a few pre-made scenarios and 4 different army values. At the 500 point level there are 9 scenarios. At first this sounds awesome, but get this.... There are 4 tutorials, one 'Countertop' game, and 4 normal games.

Depending on which base game you received, you can play only 2 of the 4 tutorials. The tutorials are OK and have basic rules along the way. I was eager to just play and skipped too many, so please read them! 

The Countertop game is a one tile 'Arena' game that is a 2 on 1 match. Quick and easy.

For the 1000 point games, there are 5. Of those 5, Three of the scenarios are not playable due to the tiles not even being available until possibly October. The other 2 require more Golems.

And at the 2-3000 point games, nothing. Even then you would have to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of figures.

Even though I knew one would have to take out a second mortgage on mom;s basement, there is LITTLE to do in this expensive demo kit.

The part that bugs me the most is the lack of description as to what is really needed before purchasing this game.... A few online stores do not have the warning that you need a newer mobile device with Bluetooth 4 Low Energy chips to even download the application. I can't fault anyone directly for this as it is on the back of the box in bold letters, but HBS should have required dealers to display this on any form of media to advertise the game. Amazon.com is one of the offenders.

As it stands, this demo kit is not really worth much unless you wait and spend more money.

Even though it may happen, there is no scenario editor or remote play. 

Not a huge issue yet, but this is a 2 player game as it stands. I do not know where the people say it is for anything other than 2. 

Also of note, the flag/banner sticker process is the worst. Not only are both ends on some stickers not symmetrical, they do not adhere to each other for very long as a few people have noted. Unknown if it is certain humidity or temperature ranges, but it would have been better to make the post have a plastic back with stickers go on each side.

One of the figures in the box had that white residue on top of the base from using super glue. On the bottom was the same thing spreading out from the post hole.

Stickers on the bases were beginning to peel at a few corners also.

While it is great to have all the rules adjudicated -- and the arguments resolved -- for you, the continuous "click to confirm" was obnoxious. Still, it is a game that rewards planning -- both your army and your strategy.

Innovative and fun. The only large scale fantasy miniatures game I play anymore. 

A computer assisted system is the future of large scale miniatures wargaming. With any luck this system will be applied and improved in other settings/genres.

My enthusiasm has dropped due to the lack of Windows support and constant bugs in the software
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The game has promise, but looses points for the software*. Luckily, that's the easiest thing to change. The components are a strange mix of really nice and really shoddy, specifically the stickers, both on the base of the figures and the flags. The tokens are also super-cheap paper instead of cardstock.

The pen works very well, and while it is slightly hard to get a read on the base stickers, you can either pick up the model, or use the card to good effect. That said, I'm not sure this makes a great board game or a great table game, it is just a cool tech, with hopefully a bright future. The PS2 game with card recognition was a similar thing.

What is great is the rules enforcement that takes place, so that my kids can play their turns by themselves.

I'm glad I didn't get more than the base set, but with a few software updates, I could probably be convinced to purchase more to play with my kids.

*Scenario setup is particularly bad, with unit information not easily divined. I was also supplied with huge amounts of mana for golems dying in one game, more than the sum of all the mana on the board and all the action points I'd had so far. Components on the setup board come back with no ID for the game, but that could be just a scenario error.

This game is giving me chills as it is the very first in a new kind of gaming experience.

Of course the score is based on the newly introduced mechanics. Just lucky I lived long enough to witness this.

You know ever I started serious board(war) gaming back in the 70's there were DREAMS we could stick the 4000+ counter games like War in Europe into some computer with 8K Ram to do the math handling :).

I am NOT joking here. Strategy and Tactics from SPI asked their readers if they wanted to buy an 8K TRS 80 to aid in the play of their boardgames...back in 1980.

Avalon Hill even made a Tank Battle Game with a board while you had to deal with putting in hex numbers each turn on your whopping 8K (nope not Mbyte or Gbyte, 8 Kbytes dudes ...) in 1981.

When you are young you have these dreams of great games and ... it worked out on our screens after say 20 years with games like shooters, World of Warcraft replacing our Magic Realm and Advanced Squad Leader games ...

But ... but nothing could replace the feeling of having YOUR fighters in hand, your figures strolling over a board. YOUR roll of the physical dice and counters/figures taking hits ... Games like Ambush or Warhammer Fantasy battles could not be replaced with computer screens ... until ...

... until Golem Arcana came to earth ...

Forget about reading 64+ pages of rules, forget about the input of hex numbers, forget about looking at a screen imagining a real 3D figure in hand. 

Golem Arcana just linked real time physical elements with the calculations and rules of a computer game without entering anything really. 

read this: you can even roll physical dice by pointing at paper or board ! :)

In 20 years we probably will be able to play full physical boardgames with computers build in on self printed or bought 3 D terrain. Intel is only 1 year away of mass selling their new nano technology based super chips costing 1 dollar, but in the meantime the first FULL playable paper boardgame is there that is controlled by a Light pen ... pointing at your PHYSICAL board/painted figures ... with all physical components, up to and including dice ...

As Golem Arcana is based on other traditional tactical mechanics and RETAINS these like - for us boardgamers - excellent modifiers and stats. It is like a true Warhammer game WITHOUT the needed 3 Army books ... I think it is indeed a look into the future for some of us that will never see 20 years ahead unfortunately.

Perfect score for a new kind of game. Innovation deserves to be recognised.

The nay sayers are complete wrong. This game brings a new experience for boardgamers.

I can imagine the future possibilities: Gears of War, D%D miniatures on a board, even the unplayable ASL could get adapted within 20 years.

But Golem Arcana lets you experience it today.

Not really a miniatures guy, but this game is fun and the technology is integrated flawlessly. Never felt awkward to tap the screen with the stylus, the game never felt "put on hold" while you stopped to use the app. It all gels very nicely to make an enjoyable game (I'm just not a miniatures guy).

I've lurked on BGG since Y2K and benefited from useful contributions from most of the community. I was compelled to finally register just to rate and commment on Golem Arcana.

This is a fantastic game that will attract new people to war/boardgaming and deter WAAC players. Both conditions suit me just fine.

The potential of the TDi/App system for upkeep,balancing and amazing hidden information scenarios are what really excite me.

Plus with my gaming group, saying "get your hands off my tdi"  or "Thats a big golem" just never seems to get old.

Too many good new things have been lost due to ignorance and fear. This can be the Heroscape of boardgames...er wait this could be the Firefly of boardgames..er...nevermind you know what I mean. Dont be such a Fox executive.

It's just fun. There is a surprising amount of depth in strategy. The army building is a blast (combining the abilities of the pilots and the ancient ones with the golems). Once you understand the way numbers are calculated, you spend more time staring at the board (to plan several steps ahead) rather than staring at the screen.

There is a lot of game under the hood.  The app does all the calculations for you but the game becomes much more enjoyable when you dig into the special abilities of all the characters and terrain.  With the app you can have a tendency to just click on goem and click on attach and click on enemy golum and see if you hit.  But what you need to do it read the little cards and find the special abilites and how they work.  You can start to set up a more strategic attack.

The app is working fine but I wish you could log in and get the stylus working a little faster.  Also some prebuild armys would be nice.

Too much back and forth between board game and iPhone -- with iPhone almost just a solo experience for each player, looking into it to see what damage they did. Games are supposed to be fun. I can see how this could grab hard-core miniature players, perhaps. I would much rather play most other games, including real hard-core miniature games or hard-core wargames (neither of which are my favorite genre).

Very happy with this game. I am a long time Battletech player and have always wanted a way to play games like this without the hassle of teaching all the rules and having long setup and takedown times. This game is amazing! The tablet handles the rules and I focus on playing with my friends and family. The stylus makes this all so easy. I highly recommend this game. Easy to pick up and play, hard to put down.

I am so happy this game was made. I am a long time Battletech table-top player and have always wanted to play games like this with my friends. The rules are handled by the tablet, and with the visuals on the screen, it is so easy to introduce new player to this game.

The miniatures are GORGEOUS! They really get my imagination going. I love that you can save a game, clean up, set up later and continue the game. The stylus works flawlessly. Using two stylus is very convenient with large numbers of players.

I am having a wonderful time with the lore. A living story that changes how the history progresses is something I have never seen in a board game.

Thank you for making this game. It is just what I have always wanted to play. You nailed it!

As a seasoned miniatures gamer, the stylus and ipad just got in the way.  I felt like I had to 'update' the iPad to let it know what I was doing, rather than using it as an information tool.  I think the cool factor would wear off pretty quick.  Also, why am I playing this if I don't get to throw dice?!  Bonus points for nice minis though, the game looks great.

Lots of neat breakthroughs going on here. The predicted iPad-integrated-to-tabletop is finally here, and they really got that integration done right.

As these things go, the world (WarMachine copy) and the chromey-fiddleyness take down my opinion many notches.

RATING: 9.5
I was intrigued when I saw the initial Kickstarter, but passed largely because I didn't like the look of the art. However, the actual minis look much better than the original art. I was able to demo the game at GenCon and purchased it, along with the first two expansions.

What I love about this game is that I can play it with my 8 year old. It is simple enough for him because the app keeps track of everything, but has enough depth for me. We both fell in love with it right of the bat. It reminds him of the Skylanders video game series (which he loves) and reminds me of Heroclix (which I love). The Action Point and Cooldown system provides a lot of balance and adds a lot of strategy; it would be really difficult to manage without the app. The world of Golem Arcanum is also really interesting and the fiction makes the game even more compelling.

There are a few key features that are missing that would cause me to rate the game even higher. Luckily, one of the advantages to this game is that updates to the app can add this. First, the army builder took a little bit of getting used to. It is also frustrating to have all the figures available listed even if they are not part of your collection. Also, even though the app handles all the rules, a rulebook would be helpful for strategy purposes. The first update already added some more maps and scenarios, but the ability to create your own would be helpful. I was also frustrated when I was not able to save a game, which was one of the selling points. I know some of these improvements are in the works, which will only make the game better.

Edit: Recent update with save feature and scenario builder were huge improvements. Army building is also much easier now (although I still think this could use some improvements). The only improvements I'm looking for now are to allow more than 2 players and remote play.

Wow, what a great, innovative game. This is a breath of fresh air. The app offers so many possibilities. Still a bit clunky but will clearly be improved. The minis are just awesome. Quality through and through. Will see if rating changes after more plays but for now, a solid 9.

I had the chance to play this game at Gencon this past weekend. I personally did not buy into the stylus gimmick that this game offers. I felt that this was basically a simple tablet game that offered you the chance to play it on a board. It felt very unnecessary. There really is no point to the board.

I wasn't sold on the rules either. The game is extremely boring. Everything about this game seemed dry and tedious to me. The rules reminded me of a miniature war game for children.

I can almost guarantee that all the high ratings this game is getting are due to the hype and the "cool" factor of the hybrid board game/digital game technology.

I will say that the miniatures look fine given that it's a board game.

This game had been looked at prior to GenCon 2014, and then seen at the convention.  My young son and myself really liked the idea of the game...he enjoys Monsterpocalypse, and this seemed like a nice jump upwards in gameplay.  We own almost 1 of everything HBS has out for GA, and we love the game.  So much so, that although I had never played in any game tournament in my life, I had to join the current one HBS has going on thru the end of April 2015.  Great game!  Would recommend to anybody with kids who like chess, miniatures gaming, war gaming, fantasy gaming...the list is long, and the possibilities endless.

There's a lot of game going on here in addition to the App stuff.  Without the App, though, the game would be much heavier as you track all the modifiers.

I've been messing around with knights, relics, ancient ones, and Colossus. I have really enjoyed delving into constructing 1000 point armies. The great thing so far is the deeper down the rabbit hole you go the more you find. Add the fact that this is a "living world" and my initial reservations about game play are gone. Love it! Are there problems? Sure but those should be cleared up with time. I love this game. Not because it's flashy or uses an ipad but because I can construct armies at my own pace and play others without bickering about rules or timing. The storyline battles are a blast and it's great to interact with NPC's during a skirmish.

Played the heck out of Golem Arcana this past weekend at GenCon.  Thoroughly enjoyed the game.  There's a lot of depth to the game that will appeal to advanced gamers, yet at the same time its easy for the novice to pick it up since the app is handling all the rules.  The pre-painted miniatures look very good and game play is very smooth once you get over a very short (meaning a few minutes) learning curve of using the stylus to tie the physical and digital pieces together.  I also got to see some of the scenario ideas that are possible with GA and I liked what I saw.  Based on the crowds I saw at GenCon, it looks like the game's debut was a success.  I can't wait to see what HBS has in store for the game!

Very enjoyable miniatures game. Nice figures, well detailed and the app is getting better all of the time. Initial playthroughs were a bit chunky but have settled into a nice play flow by using the cards with the pen (versus tapping on the figures' bases and hopping to hit the right action, etc). 
I have the Beta set and have recently been playing lots in anticipation of the release. Looking forward to playing a lot more!

I don't see the point of this. Mixing tabletop games with videogames inherits the worst traits from both worlds. 

As a half-tabletop, it needs storage space, has high price, and players need to be physically present. 

As a half-videogame, it needs battery, depends on having a device and OS, and cannot be customized or houseruled.

An very interesting concept. The figures and board are high quality. My wife likes that she doen't need to learn the rules as the iPad keeps track of everything and tells you what you can/cannot do on your turn. This tends to be Golem Arcana's downfall too: it tends to make me lazy; I haven't really learnt the rules (just relied on the iPad) and therefore don't get as immersed in the gameplay as I might otherwise.

This feels more like an app with a board instead of a board game with an app.

The pen does not always work, you often have to hold up the cards for the Golem's for the other players to use as touching the Golem never works.

Don't like that you have to pay for everything, then there are IAP for the app to enhance your Golems. When everyone is playing on my account, it sucks for everyone as if I do any IAP to enhance them, the other players won't know it.

They also seem to update the app and change things, so out of my 4 armies, 3 of them all of a sudden became WAY stronger and no longer work as is for a 500pt game and now have to be totally re-built.

Feels like an iPad game unnecessarily ported to a boardgame. Not a lot of tactical depth, and the army and scenario builder are clunky and hard to use, especially if you want to try to create 3 player scenarios. 

This should be a $3.00 App Store purchase, not a $50+ boardgame.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2015)

I finally played Golem Arcana and I must say I’m impressed. I have no problem using digital devices as gaming aids, I own and like Alchemists and XCom but Golem Arcana has the most impressive boardgame/digital device amalgamation I have seen so far. The Bluetooth stylus works perfectly and I really liked it. The game has a huge WOW factor, when we were playing it, even non gamers approached us to ask about the game. 

The iPad app does all the upkeep which I really hate to do in most games, but its potential is much greater than that, so many possibilities :D.
 
So far, I have only played the first two scenarios, so for now, the game is a very simple tactical miniature game, but it is my understanding that with each scenario the app introduces new rules to the game making it more interesting and challenging. Due to this, teaching the game to new players is a breeze while at the same time, it appeals to the heavier gamer in me. I hope the game has a lot more depth than I have seen so far.

The minis look gorgeous and (mercifully) they come assembled and painted. In general, the components are top notch.

I have nothing bad to say about the game, perhaps the fact that you can play the game on the iPad without using the miniatures or the map can bother some people, but I don’t think I will ever do that, after all,  I’m a boardgamer so I will always assemble the map and move the miniatures in real life.

Bottom line, I like Golem Arcana a lot, it has the potential to go up in my personal ratings. I think it is a very innovative game and it offers a glimpse of some possible future of the hobby. I plan to buy the game along with all its expansions.

It’s been incredible hard to get Golem Arcana to the table. Most friends (for some reason) prefer to play other games. I still like the game a lot, but my desire to play it is decreasing slowly.

The RNG in this game hates me for some reason, so I love the fact that I can roll dice manually and enter the results. I'm sad that this game failed. It's not a bad system and had a lot of options for customization. I hope someone finds a way to keep the app alive.

2016-06-24 - This is a pretty good skirmish game. I've only played the 2 tutorial scenarios, but I enjoyed the way it played and the mobile integration. It's maybe a little simplistic out of the box. You may need to add some expansions to make it really interesting. I'm looking forward to exploring the other scenarios, though.

After the first tutorial I have to say that it feels like a slugfest. Thats partly down to not being familiar with the game yet and partly the way the scenario was set up. Intial plusses, the sound from the pad and the fact it tracks all the maths. Downside so far, the pad takes attention away from the board and miniatures. I spent very little time viewing the board, maybe 10% at the most.

The game drew me in. I have now played 4 times and find it rather more interesting and the novelty of having to keep my eyes glued to the iPad has dropped off a bit. Likewise as you get used to the terrain effects you start to be able to look more at the board rather than the iPad. Using the pen and the cards makes that easier. Tapping the iPad is part of the distraction so using the cards bring the focus back to the miniatures.

I also own the 4 army packs.

So after 4 plays solo I found nobody interested in playing the game so decided to sell it on. A pity, but you have to be realistic.

Initial rating based on a 4-player game I joined in progress.

Strait-forward fantasy miniatures skirmish game. A 500 point battle results in 3 to 4 figures for each side and players battle to be the first to 3 VP, which are earned by holding objectives on the map. This results in short, brutal battles with very little subtlety.

The stylus and tablet greatly enhance play, taking the place of rulebooks and charts. As a noob, I was able to learn the basic mechanics quickly as the tablet took care of modifiers, how far a figure could move, etc... I really like these tools and hope more games adapt them.

Excellent idea that combines a miniature game with an electronic component that keeps track of all of the fiddly bits that slow down gameplay.  I guess I enjoy the low tech nature of the boardgaming hobby and find the electronic elements interfere a bit with my enjoyment of the game.  That said, it works as advertised, is quite a groundbreaking idea and I do like the idea of allowing the players to focus on the game rather than the bookkeeping.

This is BY FAR my favorite miniatures game of the last decade.  I really enjoy the software handling all of the rules fiddliness, but having transparency into the specifics, if I so desire.  The prepainted miniatures are simply lovely, and I'm proud to field them right out of the box.  The planned support for this game is really intriguing, and I know I plan to follow the game from this point forward.

Got a convention-style demo where two basic armies start right on top of each other and just fight. I felt as though we spent all our time looking at the app and could have just as easily been playing a video game instead of a board game. The board and minis basically felt extraneous. I would need to play a lot more to see whether that tactical combat feel comes through because aside from the tech involved I don't think the game by itself was all that interesting. A good bit of the strategy probably comes from the army-building part (choosing golems, pilots, additional spells and artifacts etc). This feels like a proof-of-concept and first step product into this board/digital crossover realm. Ultimately for me it's a straightforward dice-chucker but I didn't hate it; if someone suggested it I'd be happy enough to play once in awhile with their copy.

Picked this up from Spirit Games for just £9 (expansions were £3.60 each). Even casting aside the gimmicky 'tabletop digital interface' stylus, this is worth it just for the painted minis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game is played on the tablet. The minis and other physical components are just window dressing. It's an expensive peripheral input device wrapped around a tablet strategy game. This is less like the "marriage of digital and physical" gaming and more like Skylanders or Disney Infinity. It's a videogame with plastic pieces you have to buy to really play even though those pieces have little to do with the actual gameplay.

On top of that, the gameplay is boring, downright tedious. Instead of being deeper than your average wargame (which you'd think digital technology could enable), it's incredibly light and barely distinguishable from the legions of touch-oriented strategy games it was clearly inspired by. If you want an accessible, pre-painted wargame to introduce your friends to the hobby with, get X-Wing. It's easier to play (because you're not constantly tripping on the superfluous pen interface), faster, more exciting, more tactical and just plain better. You can get more minis for your money, too.

Golem Arcana is disappointing in every way. It's basically an expensive, high-quality execution of a poorly considered gimmicky concept. All the pre-painted minis in the world can't disguise the boring game at it's core.

RATING: 5.1
Tactical combat with overproduced miniatures. Pretty fun to be honest. But I dislike the fact that your entire round can be useless (or even harmful to you) just because you missed a couple of dice rolls. The cooldown mechanic is interesting. 

It also feels like you'd be better off just playing it as a pure digital game on your PC, tablet or console.

I have played some miniature games, but never had such success of playing any game with non-gamers, perfect gateway game.

I like cooldown mechanic and how it works together with action points, you can push your golems to the limits but that will cost you. 

Great catch up mechanic in form of granting mana for dead golems, you never feel like you have no chance of pulling a trick or two even if you loose some units first. Most games I've played been very dramatic and close.

Rules are easy to understand but aren't dumbed down, some rules like terrain modifiers can be more complex thanks to app handling all calculations.

Great army building customisation. Layer upon layer of possibilities with golems, knights, relics and ancient ones providing unique abilities.

New features coming up, the future looks great. Connection to internet allows for easy balancing and errata without delays (no army points are printed on anything)

Living world scenarios are interesting and pushes the story forward.

Can't wait for remote play.

All in all despite few flaws and bugs I give it 10 because of how well the app is integrated with physical pieces, truly revolutionary game.

this game makes no sense as a board game. no not that it isn't understandable, it's just a generic tablet turn based tactical game. (Final Fantasy Tactics, with dice, if you will)

adding a blue tooth pen and a board to that doesn't make it any better. having to share a tablet, strain to read stats, and generally that it's easier to play without the miniatures (which are awesome looking and the only light in this gloom of a nothing game) makes no sense. no sense at all.

RATING: 7
I backed this game on Kickstarter and received the Kickstarter version a couple weeks ago.  I finally got to play a full game with my 8 year old son and we both had a blast!  The look and feel of the physical portion of the game is excellent.  The golems are all very detailed, pre-painted and really look nice.  The game looks and plays similar to Battletech, but the rules are all calculated by the app so it makes it a lot smoother to play a game (especially with children).  The app is pretty slick and worked fine.  Unfortunately I had to play on my phone because my older tablet wasn't supported.  I have a Moto X and the game played fine on that device, we just had to hand the phone back and forth.  The tutorial missions are fairly simple but there is more depth to the game once you get into later scenarios.  The developers also plan on adding more and more scenarios as time goes on.  After some time passes and they add scenarios, the game will be even better. Since the app is connected to the Internet, they can do some really cool things like adding scenarios and story-based missions etc are planned.  There is a lot of freedom there to tweak the rules and fine-tune the game and missions as time goes on.  The potential for that type of expansion in the future is very powerful and cool.  As it stands now, the starter kit is a great way to just load up the app and play a nice match against a friend or family member in about 40 minutes or so.  The gameplay flows smoothly once you get the hang of it and it's a lot of fun.  There is also the additional appeal of collecting the very cool figures.  I'm very glad I backed this project and I look forward to what's coming in the future!

Added notes: Some negative reviews below mention complaints about how the game is overly simple and would be easier to play without the physical board and miniatures.  I think those are valid complaints, but I strongly disagree with both.  This is a website for fans of board games, and I think most people here would agree that there is a kind of 'magic' about sitting down at an actual table with friends/family to play a good board game.  How often do you think 2 or more people would sit down with an ipad or tablet to play a board game?!  I don't think very often.  Having gorgeous (and collectable) figures and moving them around an actual board, is just more fun.  The app takes the tedium out of managing rules and dice rolls and allows people to focus on what is actually important, the movement and abilities of your characters! An app can never replace the physical act of playing a board game with friends!

And about complexity, the game does have depth when you are willing to take the time to dive into it.  The depth comes from the different abilities of your Golems and how they play against each other.  Also keep in mind that the tutorial only goes over a simple battle between two teams consisting of three golems each, but the tutorial doesn't get into Knight's (basically golem 'pilots') abilities and The Ancient's abilities and mana pool management etc and how to build and army based on different skills.  Those are the basic elements of games like Magic: the Gathering and there are 'a few' people in this world who have found enough depth in that game to keep them busy for quite a while.

I'm not trying to say that the game is perfect, but giving the game a 1 or 2 for those reasons doesn't seem fair to me and I felt the need to counter-point those arguments.

We purchased this game at Gen Con 14 and it just arrived yesterday.  We are very disappointed.  The app currently has significant flaws and crashes constantly (every 5-10 min) on the iPhone 4s. This causes the loss of all in process game data and the current game setup.  The crashes continue even after multiple uninstall/reinstall/restarts and, judging by the comments posted in the App Store, I'm not alone in my criticism. We will be trying this game again tonight using the iPod v 5 Touch but have little faith it will work. It is also disappointing the app is not compatible with the iPad 2, which is the device I'm using to write this review.  Unless/until HBS updates it's app to fix its stability issues, I do not recommend anyone purchase this product.

The app and the digital "pen" used to read the board and models work beautifully.

The game itself is very rudimentary for a tabletop wargame.

Being forced to check the device the app is on can be annoying, but since it's the only way to figure out what is happening it's necessary.

Though the models are pre-painted they're quite poor quality and too expensive.

This may be the next frontier in Boardgaming.  All book-keeping and statistical tracking is done with an optical Stylus linked to an App on your Smartphone or Tablet.  Very detailed prepainted miniatures engage in combat in scenario based campaigns.  Thus far HBS has supported the game and its App admirably.  The only downsides are the expense of the figures and the lack of a good way to transport or store them.  If you are a completionist be prepared to invest both money and real estate to this title.

Wonderful game. The use of tablet really enhances play and is a breeze to pick-up leaving learning the golem/knight/ancient one strategies as the only real "learning curve", and that's the great kind of learning curve, imo. A variety of scenarios, board layouts, golems, and attack strategies make for some deep and fresh game play. Quality of the miniatures is very good overall with excellent design and component quality and good paint schemes. Only 1 real "miss" (The Black Widow Elites). The Jagara Colossus is flat out stunning.

I am a little mixed about this one.
On the plus side:
- The technology is impressive
- The Minis look very good
- For a minis game it is VERY accessible (thanks to the technology)
On the minus side:
- The integration of physical material and technology is not very good. The physical material is not really needed. It's only purpose is to look nice. You essentially play on the tablet, not on the board.

All in all still an interesting attempt in the field of hybrid games.

Owned, played, loved.  Golem Arcana has accomplished exactly what it set out to do.   It removes the 300 page rulebook from miniature tabletop games and is accessible to gamers of all ages and skill levels.

I'm sure this game is great but I don't consider this a board game.  As the box says, the app and stylus will figure out everything for you.  You don't need to hassle with learning rules or keeping track of stuff or using your imagination. You don't even need to bother with interacting with the other players. The app will even have fun for you.  What are you doing Dave?  Why bother reading a book when you can just watch movies. Like I have said in other digital-board game comments... I play board games to take a break from technology and enjoy the human company of my friends and family for a couple hours each week. However, the pre-painted golem miniatures are way cool and if you are a mini collector you must run to the FLGS and buy this now.

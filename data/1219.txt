RATING: 7
Provisional rating based on 1 quick game with my 4 year old daughter.
She liked finding the locations on the board and later she liked putting the maze together as a 'jigsaw'!

I hope to give it a try with my nephew and niece who are a little older....

Update:  My niece (9) and nephew (7) absolutely loved it and have basically demanded a copy.

Update: Got them a copy.  Then now demand to play it every time I see them.  A hit!

A fun kids game built around solving routing puzzles to race to your objectives more quickly than your opponents. In resolving your routing player shift the pathways around on the board, this affects other players' routing and produces incidental player interaction.

This is such a great game - with kids, and other adults.  It's like Maze Runner the game - it changes every turn.  Perhaps I like it because I'm not that good at it.  I can't see the possibilities and then, all of a sudden, I can walk straight to what I need.  How did that happen?

RATING: 6
As an old school game for kids, this is not a bad option for a fairly simple challenge that makes you look at the board to find doable routes to your target tiles. Our kids like to play it occasionally. Adults usually can't stand it more often than rarely. It is great for adult nostalgia, though, if you grew up with it in your home.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another wonderful game that I spent hours playing as a child. The moving tiles, the changing paths, the search for the next mythical creature or item... what fun! It helps that I have great spacial awareness and can easily see how the paths will change by inserting a piece here or there. I loved this game far more than my sister, but my sister was a good enough sport to play with me. One of these days I have got to play this again.

A good solid kid's game, with enough to ensure adults enjoy themselves as well.  Pretty much a no-brainer for any gamer with kids around 6-10 years old.  I haven't tried it adult to adult, but it's the kind of kid's game that could well actually work that way with a minor rules tweak here and there to prevent infinite looping or fortress construction.

The sliding tiles mechanic is interesting, but there's not a lot of decision-making (there's usually one optimal move each turn, whether it's setting up a later move or capturing ). Points for being able to play with kids, but not a lot of adult replay value IMO.

This quirky little kid's title is a fantastic gateway game for getting non-gamers interested in gaming.  Very simple rules and simple strategies make for a smooth transition to the field of gaming.  The game also is satisfying in that it is very art-like in the ever changing nature of the board seeing the patterns emerge as you shift the corridors for benefit or hindrance.  A mildly surreal experience and very enjoyable.

This rating is based on how the game plays for a younger audience . This is a fantastic strategy game for kids to learn how to think ahead and manipulate their environment. It promotes basic lateral thinking and visual processing, much in the way Tetris or other puzzle videogames do.
I played the hell out of this when I was a kid, and was delighted to find that a 25-year Anniversary edition had been produced.

Very strong recommendation for any household with kids who are approaching gaming age. Though the recommended age range is 8+, I think it is basic enough to start a little younger (I remember playing it when I was 5-6).

Pretty good game that's teetering on the edge of holding an adult's interest. The shifting tunnels allow for some thought as you try to plan a few moves ahead, but in practice they can be fiddly, getting stuck at times. Component quality is pretty good, and the art is well done. Worth picking up if you have kids ages 5 and up and can grab it for $15 dollars or less.

My early Ravensburger edition lacks the aMAZEing adjective in its title.

A "dungeon" crawl to find valuable objects in a moving maze of rooms; what could go wrong?

Another triumph for marketing with a poor game spawning many derivatives.

[i]Posted: 7/5/06, Rated: 6[/i]

I'm afraid that I have my timeline backwards.  The first "Labyrinth" title that I played was [i][thing=437]Master Labyrinth[/thing][/i], which was awarded the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Deutscher_Spiele_Preis]Deutscher Spiele Preis[/geekurl][/i] in 1991.  I consider that to be an excellent game, especially for people who are unfamiliar with German games.  While staying at my cousin's house, I found a copy of [i]Amazing Labyrinth[/i] in the basement, still in shrinkwrap.  Time for introductions.

The initial board layout is familiar, randomly placing the tiles in the channels on the board.  These tiles have pictures of the various reagents printed on them, instead of having separate tokens.  Each player is dealt three cards, which represent individual objectives.  These are kept secret.  Since no two players will ever be vying for the same ingredient, it is possible for you to unknowingly help your opponent while trying to help yourself.  I much prefer the "open information" of [i][thing=437]Master Labyrinth[/thing][/i], where you must choose whether you want to  strive for the current ingredient, to better position yourself for the next one, or to thwart an opponent's efforts.

When a player reaches the ingredient on her first card, she turns this card over for all to see.  She then peeks at her second card, which becomes her next goal.  When she has visited all three of her objectives, she has to return to her starting position.  Short of deducing your opponent's targets earlier in the game by observing how she manipulated the maze, this last segment is the only time in [i]Amazing Labyrinth[/i] when you are able to hinder her progress.  The onus of stopping her usually falls upon the player whose turn precedes her -- a responsibility that dampens some of the enjoyment for the blocking player.

[i]Amazing Labyrinth[/i] has the potential to be a great game, potential that I feel was realized in [i][thing=437]Master Labyrinth[/thing][/i].  However, the latter title is becoming harder to find.  If you do pick up a copy of [i]Amazing Labyrinth[/i], I would suggest the following changes:

1. When initially creating the maze, fill in the spaces around the perimeter with tiles that do not have items printed on them.  Save the "item tiles" for the interior spaces.

2. Leave another such "empty" tile as the last one, which will be inserted as part of the first player's turn.

3. Do not deal cards to the individual players.  Instead, use the deck as the sequence of common objectives.  Shuffle the cards, and place the deck [i]face up[/i] next to the board.

4. Remove the top card, and set it face up next to the pile.  This card depicts the first ingredient that all players will attempt to capture.  The next visible card on top of the deck will be the second ingredient.

5. The first player to arrive at the space depicted by the single card set to the side of the deck "captures" that card, and takes it into his hand.  Then the next card on top of the deck is set to the side, and becomes the new, common objective.  The card that is now visible on top of the deck will be the third ingredient.

6. When the last card is captured, all of the players count their cards.  The player with the most cards is the winner.

7. I leave it up to you to decide if, during the course of the game, the number of cards that each player has captured is public or private information.

8. You can use a smaller number of cards in the deck for a shorter game.

Playing with those variations, I'd give [i]Amazing Labyrinth[/i] a 7.

The most difficult thing as a gamer parent is finding fun games to play with my younger kids that actually give them a chance to win without me letting them win.  One of the rule variants in the book is to let small children look at their treasure cards and pick the next one they will look for.  This simple change made this game a big hit for me.  My 13 year old and I were able to compete with each other while my younger kids (5 and 7) messed up the labyrinth on us just going after the closest treasures in their lists.  The little kids ended up going out before us and we almost tied.  My last treasure was right next to my starting tile.  I picked mine up and on the very next turn she got hers but there was no way for her to beat me back home.  Fun game.

DeafMute KILLED me over and over at this game.  Be it by luck, or by skill, that guy creamed me.  I may not be too smart, and this game showcases that fact, but jeebus, I could not for the life of me get this game!  It is easy peasy, but I just couldn't get it.  So I hate it.

This game is fun and relaxing.  Rainy Day Games in Portland had it set up for a long time, and I'd stand there by myself playing through half the cards. (It's good with other people too.) I'll go ahead and state the obvious: it's a great game to play with kids, especially because as an adult you won't want to wrap it up after the second turn.

My wife picked this up at a yard sale for $1.  She had no idea what she was buying but the owner said it was a fun family game.
My wife, me, and my 7 yr. old daughter play this one often.  It's very simple to teach and you can vary the length of play by adjusting the amount of destinations each player needs to reach.  Excellent family fun.  (Especially for the price!)

Kids game for sure, but fun and cute. I wish I had an older edition with the better artwork before it went CG. Plays best with 4, not so great with 2. as the board doesn't get shifted around enough to easily prevent one person from racing directly back home after gathering all their treasures. Otherwise, simplistic, but fun!

Played this game at my FLGS.  While it does require some strategy, there is also a large element of diplomacy.  It becomes entirely too easy for a group to work together to screw over another person or even just to help each other.  I also found it to be too slow for my tastes.

Great fun for families.  My wife's favorite game.  Good spatial reasoning practice.  Ingenious design.  You can handicap it well for young kids (you turn over 1 treasure card at a time; they play with all six -- or some subset -- of their treasures face up and seek them in the most convenient order).  We own the 25th anniversary edition which has better art plus wizard movement tokens instead of generic token -- worth the extra $$ IMHO.

UPDATE:  Raised rating from 7 to 8 since after three years of owning this game we still frequently play it.

This game seems like it should be so good. Moving the tiles messes up the game for the other players. But you don't know what they are seeking so you will rarely be actively blocking them. Visualizing what the board will look like before you move.

I loved this as a child and I still think it's okay in the right circumstances. You need to be able to think spatially and try to think a few turns ahead and position yourself in rows where the other players can't hurt you much, so I guess the tactics involved in this game is actually decent.

I like that you can adjust the difficulty and allow children to search for all of their treasures in the order they like. Nevertheless, I don't think I will play it much, but if I'm asked, I probably wouldn't refuse.

Rated 7 after one play. Admittedly, this was a play with my wife, so I didn't really get to try this out as a kid's game. I imagine the age for this game is as it states... 7 and up... but I might be wrong. I want to try this out on my niece and nephew.

It's a cute, simple, and clever game. And, if it's a challenge to try and find games that you can play with kids but that are still mildly engaging for adults, this just might fit the bill.

The original Labyrinth game but likely the last one for me to play having already played Magic Labyrinth and Chateau Roquefort. For whatever reason seeing the whole board does not do me any favors as I try to find the best move that always gets me to the spot I need to get to even when it's impossible, but I still try to puzzle it out. Be the first to get to all of your treasure spots first and you're the winner. I like how in other similar games portions of the board are hidden that add a bit more randomness to the game to make the whole labyrinth idea better in my opinion. My daughter still likes it but I think Chateau Roquefort will always be requested by her over this.

A puzzle game. Playing with open goals is probably a good way to make it more interesting. That way you can thwart your opponents or - more interestingly - anticipate their moves and use those to improve your position. If it wasn't a kids game, it would get a 4 or 5 from me. But as a kids game, it is one of the few that isn't dex or memory. That is good.

I bought this to play with my six year old. On the plus side, he enjoys the bits, the theme, and the gameplay. He completely understands the rules and the basics of strategy. The strategy to play this game, however, is far more challenging than I expected.  I don't think he'll really get it for a few more years. On the minus side I would never choose to play this game against an adult. My taste in gaming is not for abstracts or games with meaningless themes. I like my games to portray something interesting, be it historical, fantasy, or sci fi.

Update: He's really amaze-ingly (pun intended) good at this game.  And it's quite fast as well, which is nice.  We can set a certain number of treasures to find, depending on how much time is left before bedtime.  Very glad we got this.

Even incomplete (my copy is missing a treasure card), this game has been well-received among my "light-gaming" siblings and friends. The rules are easy to learn, and the game play is essentially an exercise in puzzle-solving. This game is especially noteworthy because it is one of the few games that I can convince non-gamers to try at least once (or twice, or thrice...)

This is a nifty little game that's ideal for children.  There is also a nice equalizer where you can allow the younger child to view all of his treasure objectives throughout the game and the more advanced player can only view their NEXT objective (card).  

My son's first 'gamer' breakthrough moment occurred with this game. He was 4 and a half, and could already claim a treasure. He placed the maze tile in a place where it could ONLY screw up my path. Then he said, "Your guy's stuck!"  I was so proud of my little cut-throat gamer!

One of my daughter's favorite games (beginning when she was 4 y.o. and now at 6).  Didn't go over as well as I'd expected with my son on first try, but now he really enjoys this.  I really like it because it's easy to handicap for the kids either by letting them find fewer objects (or play with 2+ cards showing instead of just one) or allowing them to slide 2 tiles instead of one on each turn.
Good early logic game for kids.
Edit:  Bumped up the rating to 8 for my daughter.  At 6 yrs. old now she still loves this game and requests it frequently.

Thrift find April 2008.  

Welcome to Eurogames my child.  Great gateway for children and also adults.

Game play is simple.  Take the tile passed to you from the previous player and try to push it into a row/column to change the structure of the maze so that you move in the maze to pick up your treasures before your opponent.  Pass the tile that popped out of the maze to the next player.

My kids really liked this one when we first got it.  They have played it far more than I have as well.  Great puzzle game.  Enjoyable enough for me too.  All my kids gladly and are capable to play this one (5 - 10)..

Family game.  Shifting puzzles as you try to find a way to your items on the board.

RATING: 4
Components: The cards could be sturdier, and have more appealing backs, but the tiles are pretty, functional, and easy to wield.

Experience: Definitely not for adults. It can be fun, shifting about the corridors in search of my trinkets, but there is no way to deduce the objectives of my opponents, and therefore it is just a race game with a puzzle element; one player's decisions certainly do affect how the others must play, but that player couldn't have planned it that way.

Clever mechanism, but it can get pretty annoying when the maze changes just as you were about to pick up an artifact. I know that's the point, but it's still annoying with 4 players.

The only reason I am even mentioning this is for completeness. The person who taught this game to me, taught it incorrectly, and as it stood it was impossible for someone to win unless someone else directly took an action that allowed them to win.

Similar to Stars are Right in manipulating the board and screwing people over.  But it is more obvious in this game what you are aiming for.

RATING: 8.5
Really fun, and I like this a lot better than the Master Labyrinth version.  I love the puzzle aspect of finding the best way to change the maze.  It does have some luck, but it rewards clever play.  It's also really easy to teach to non-gamers, but can be a bit of a brain-burner for those who are not good at spacial reasoning (imagining how the maze will look once it is changed).

RATING: 4
Potentially a good children's game, but only for the very patient or analytical types. It looks approprate for kindergarteners, yet every shift in tiles changes so many paths that it can be bewildering. The largest problem is that players of uneven skill level will not be able to compete well, so adults or serious players will thrash opponents.

I like this game, but it is a bit random, which is great for kids, but for adults, you get the feeling that if you were so inclined, you could delay the end indefinitely but just moving the winning players pieces constantly.  When you play with 4 players, there is definitely a 'gang up on the winner' strategy when you play with adults.  Most people will probably find this game too random to have an actual strategy, but if you DON'T play for blood and guts, there IS some strategy to it.

RATING: 7.5
Very creative game, and novel concept!  Move maze parts to reconfigure the maze, and move your piece to the treasure squares.  Depends somewhat on what cards you draw, but the actual game play requires great creative thinking!  Enjoyable for children and adults alike. 

Also owned: [gameid=437] - a more complex and enjoyable version for gamers.  Its superiority is a result of point-scoring, magic wands (extra turn), trading, and the competition to get the right ingredients for your secret potion.  

Also owned: [gameid=533] - much simpler card game using similar artwork.

I feel like I should like this game more, but if just felt way too random.

aMAZEing Labyrinth is a game I've only played a few times. Each game was with my niece who was seven. She loved the puzzle aspect and feeling clever. What makes it a keeper for me is the old-fashioned charm of its fantasy theme. It looks as if it belongs in a classroom from the early eighties alongside Schoolhouse Rock videos and a Lite-Bright. Rating for kids. 

Update: My partner and I played this recently to see if we could enjoy it without kids. Definitely not a game for adults.

+ Interesting mechanics. Did you say modular board?

(Rating as a kid's game is eightish; I think it's one of the best kid's games I've ever played. No rating, since as an adult I'm likely to give it a three or four due to its simplicity. Of course, if you have problems with spatial recognition...) Maze manipulation game where players start at the corners of the square board and go around a maze visiting spots as given on randomly-dealt cards. The twist is that the maze is mutable. Each turn a player takes a loose maze piece and slides it into a row or column of the maze, moving the row/column and kicking out the piece at the other end. That piece is passed to the next player. The game would be nastier if the goal cards were open, but hey, this is a kids' game. A pretty good one, too. Recommended for young'uns from, oh say six to twelve.

RATING: 8
Lots of fun.  Mostly two-player games, but occasionally three-player games.  Three-player games are alot more fun, I think.  We are currently using our own variant of flipping over all the movable tiles at the start and having one flipped-over pile for the treasure/monster cards.  Tiles could only be flipped over to the image side if they were pushed off the end of a row, and you couldn't move across a tile that was face-down; and whenever the last treasure/card is picked by one player, the other player (if all cards finished) heads straight for their home corner.  A player can either win by having the most cards, or by getting to home-base first, or both.  Also:  Cards are drawn one-at-a-time by each player (not dealt out in same amount per player at start of each game), and the next card isn't drawn until the current one has been reached.  Played this way with Noelle today (7-6-2012) and she wasn't so keen on it, but did play one game of it (I won the most treasure cards, but she won the race back to home base).  She and her mom have their own way of playing it that they seem to like alot better.  Which is okay with me.

Ötletes labirintustologatós játék. A játékosk feladata megtalálni az labirintusban a titokban kiosztott kincseiket. A labirintus minden második sora és oszlopa mozgatható egy plusz labirintus lapkával. Mindenki egyet tolhat és addig mozoghat a bábujával ameddig csak akar, illetve tud. A tolás utána  túloldalon kiesik egy lap, ezzel fog a következő játékos tolni. Nagyon jópofa a játékban, hogy hirtelen meg tud válrozni a labirintus felépítése a tologatás miatt. Emlékeim szerint egy hátránya volt. A győzelemhez közeledő játékosra mindeni rászáll, aki így nem tud nyerni. A többiek behozzák. És gyakran végződik úgy a játék, hogy valakinek döntenie kell az uolső lépésénél, hogy most A-nak vagy B-nek nyerje meg a játékot.
Sokat játszottunk vele anno, de már 15 éve biztos nem került elő. Elő kéne már venni! :)

Amazing Labyrinth is an interesting game.  It is ultimately a race game, but has the feel of being an interactive puzzle.  In many ways Amazing Labyrinth is a game unto itself, as there really is nothing else like it that I have played (disregarding it's sequels).  This is a game that requires more thought than initially assumed by it's appearance.  The quaint, folksy illustrations give this game an innocent shell, yet the nature of the modular board in this game makes for an often brain burning challenge.  Long term planning in this game is difficult if one is spacially challenged, as the constant shifting of the maze can quickly throw off players who generate tunnel vision when eyeing paths to their next location.  The Amazing Labyrinth is also a game that scales well for both number of players and age.  On evenings when I have four or less gathered for gaming, this title more often than not will make a showing. Good fun!

I think this game is loved more out of nostalgia than out of actual experience. With young kids, it tends to be pretty random (they can't see how their choices will affect the board); with older kids & adults, it bogs down into AP due to the sheer number of choices and possible consequences.

RATING: 8
A truly amazing tile game that is great for families. The luck-factor is rather high, which makes it a lot more fun for kids who aren't very good at thinking spatially. Games can be finished rather quickly, so you can easily get in a couple games within an hour. 

The quality of the product is pretty top notch, but you can tell it is an older game based on its design. My friends and I are working on a way to turn Labyrinth into a co-op game, so if that happens, I'll be posting a video describing how to do so!

Yep, we played this moving maze game loads as kids. Who didn't? I think we got a couple of rules wrong, but it was still a blast.

And you know what? It's still fun. I recently acquired a copy from a charity shop and have been playing it with my four-year-old. Every time I play I'm thinking - you could play this on a gamer level and it would be great. One to crack open at the next gaming night, perhaps...

I realize that this is more of a kids game, but since I'm not a kid I can only rate it as an adult.  I find it to be tolerable, no more.  The changing board makes advance planning almost impossible, and the player who draws easy destinations will be unstoppable.

Looks like a kiddie game, and it is, but I've found adults  who've enjoyed taking the time to puzzle out the shifting board and claim the treasures. Also, given your group dynamics, someone will inevitably suggest a hilarious re-theme. 
So far, my favorite suggestion is to re-skin it as food moving through the lower intestines.

...Not even kidding.

RATING: 8
A simple idea that is magic.

While luck of the draw can sometimes determine a game, there is still a lot of choices, dare I say, fascinating choices in the game. I like how your pawn in not restricted in its movement to one square a turn but can go the length of a path in a turn.

The game has an apparent toy factor since you are sliding the board itself around. However, that is the tactical heart of the game.

Here's a fun way to expand this game: 
Give players stats (STR, DEX, etc.) and weapons.
 Then add a monster. 
When a path is cleared between a player and a monster, roll for initiative. 
Also, I plan on generating a trap table (1d20) with traps, monsters, and curses, etc. to be rolled for each dungeon treasure found. 
Great dungeon crawler.

RATING: 7
Relatively easy to learn and play but there's a clever puzzle/tactical element involved. It's aimed at children but is perfectly suited to adults as well.Only downside is you can get stuck in one place, it can impact heavily on your actions and potentially cost you any chance of victory, this is especially evident in higher player counts. Aside from that, and perhaps it's simplicity, it's a great game, as an added bonus it's quite easily setup and put away.

This game can work on a lot of levels, for kids or grownups or both. Its rules are easy to grasp, but there are some very interesting tactical decisions to make. Players, even adults, will start to see more and more efficient ways of getting from point A to point B, yet a degree of randomness keeps this skill from being an overwhelming advantage over new players.

The board is brilliantly designed. I've never seen any other game like it. While you certainly won't get overly involved in the theme of the game, the sheer tactile joy of shifting the maze makes it worth the price of admission. The game often creates tense moments as other players shift the maze to your benefit or detriment. You often want to cheer or cringe, but have to resist doing so for fear it will give away your intentions. It's a really intense feeling for a game with such simple rules.

It's not without its flaws. It does suffer from analysis paralysis, but if you don't take it too seriously you can have a good time. Or perhaps more accurately put, "as long as all players take it the same amount of seriously." The endgame can really be quite cutthroat as your final destination on the board is open information, unlike the other secret ones along the way. This makes it incumbent upon each player to not only advance his/her own goals, but also to defend against the win by the following player. This is a deep concept, and one that really pushes this game out of the realm of being a pure kids' game if played competitively.

Nice game for starting the gaming night. The playtime goes under 20 minutes, which is ideal for such a game. It has cool tactical aspects because the map is always changing. I can see why this game is in printing after 25 years, however the age started to show on it.

Pros / Cons:
-Cool tactical decisionts to make, under 20 minutes.
-Because of the always changing map you will always try to find a solution in the always new opportunities. This means the game has some replayability.

-It can be boring especially when your enemies on turn.
-If you have great memory what symbol went out you can take too much of an advantage more likely if you are ahead.
-It is big problem if your enemy finished all of his object but you still have one - your enemy is trying to go to the finish line but he knows what you need too. You have an almost impossible work to do.

2.what players do in front of you and how that affects your laid out plans
3.what card piece the player in front of you gives you.... you can sometimes find yourselve cornered in as the right card never comes up and going a different way is not an option or simply not feasible.

One of my kids got this game as a birthday gift.  I didn't have much in the way of expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is basically a puzzle game where you are trying to manipulate the board to help your character and hinder the other players.  I was surprised at how well my kids were able to pick it up.  You can see them already starting to think one or two moves ahead, which will come in handy for them when they start playing more complicated games.  I think this is a GREAT game for younger kids (6-8).  It isn't quite as interesting with an older crowd, but the game is interesting enough for adults to play with their kids.  If you want to spend 30 mins or so playing with your kids, this is a very good option.

A challenging exercise in using spatial skills for older children that holds some interest for adults too. Ignore the 'Age 8' rating on the box, this is a very tough game.

A very good game for kids. We play it with a handicap for the adult. Kids can choose which treasures they want to get first and we start with the treasure on top.

RATING: 6
My kids (9 and 12) love it and the moving maze parts are fun.  The 9yo gets frustrated when she's boxed in and can't make progress on a move.  There's quite a bit of downtime while the kids think though that can make it frustrating for adults at times.  It is nice and quick to teach though.  A good one to play with Grandma & Grandpa who won't tolerate long and extensive rules.

Kids like mazes, so this went over well.

For the first several plays, it's probably best to "help" the younger players - i.e., give them one or two fewer treasures to find and/or let them look at their top two cards on their turn and allow them to collect either.  After a few plays, our crew was perfectly capable of winning playing even handed.

Bought for my kids who are too young to grasp ticket to ride!  I like the element of moving the tiles so that the map always changes.  We play in a ticket to ride way in that you draw 3-5 cards and play them in whatever order you prefer.  It removes some of the luck of the version in the rulebook.

RATING: 4
Me and a couple friends had an hour to blow right after I found this at Goodwill so we tried it out. It got repetitive really fast as it felt like we would endlessly struggle to get to the treasures only to have the board change and screw everything up. After about 20 minutes or so of this we finally decided to just allow people to look at there whole hand of cards and get the treasures in whatever order they wanted. This vastly improved the game IMO. Still not a great game for adult gamers but it added a whole level of strategy on top of the basic rules.

I'm thinking I want to try this game with every body sharing a single deck of goals with say 5 or so displayed at a time with everyone competing over them. I have a feeling it would be a good beer and pretzels game at that point.

In any case I think this is a game that I will be happy play with young children (once I have them).

RATING: 6
Slimy, yet satisfying.  

My 5 year old has quickly moved up from Labyrinth Junior to this version in less than 5 plays.  She prefers the complexity and challenge of this to the Junior edition already!  

That statement should tell you pretty much all you need to know about this simple, filler game.  So easy a 5 year old can play it with little to no trouble at all, yet manages to be fun and indirectly interactive due to the puzzle pieces each player has to place on their turn, which can significantly effect the maze for the next player.  You can't really think ahead on this one.  Thus, if you don't care for long-term strategy and want a quick, background-type gaming experience while you get your socializing on-- or, if you're looking to get your kids involved in a game that demands no actual reading to play, but still requires thought to achieve goals, this is it.  A classic... but may not have a permanent home in my collection once the kids move past it and onto more interesting games.

I really like this game, but I use a variant I found on this site: 

Normally each player would have a set of treasures to hunt inside the labyrinth; well, instead of that, now the whole deck of treasures is set at the table in one single pile. Then you flip over the first two cards at the top: the first one, is the current treasure to be hunted by ALL the players. The second one, is the next treasure to be hunted. Only the current treasure can be collected at any time, but you may position yourself in a good situation to get the next one. When a player has collected enough treasures (12 with 2 players,8 with 3 players, and 6 with 4 players) that player must return to it's starting position. The first to do so wins. Also, it's not allowed to move your pawn on your first turn, just insert a tile as any other turn, but do not move (this is to prevent easy to get treasures at the beginning).

This was a nice surprise, nice fun game that you may play with the entire family.

I am rating this game as a kids game.  I really enjoy playing this one with my kids.  I love watching their wheels churn as they try to figure out the best way to get to their treasure.  It brings me serious joy when I watch them make a particularly smart move. My daughter (8) is learning how to plan a few moves ahead.  We let my son (6) look at all his cards and pick the order he wants to collect his treasure.  Using this variant, I haven't beat him yet so it provides a fun challenge for me.  One difficult to get to treasure can really impede your progress.  This is a must for parents who like to play games with their kids.

This game is a lot of fun with kids but loses it&#039;s luster with grownups. It also says it is for 2-4 but it&#039;s MUCH better with 4. It really doesn&#039;t work too well with 2 IMHO. But the tile sliding labyrinth mechanic is neat. Kids will love it.

A fun and silly game of 'complete the objective'. If I would've played this game as a child it would've been a 9. Seeing the board dynamically change is a treat and doesn't at all feel gimmicky as it actually makes for strategical decisions of teleporting and denial. Not something that I would play all of the time, but could be coaxed into it every once in a great while.

Played the deluxe version and the play in the dark version.
I thought the execution of the in the dark version was slightly better.
I actually quite liked the game. The find 6 treasures is perfect as it mitigates some of the luck. I probably would change the rules to make a common draw pile that has 6 times the number of cards in it. Draw a new card when you completed a quest.
this makes it impossible to cheat.
Game is over when someone completed a quest and no cards are left in tje draw pile.

Rating is based on how much the kids like it and how many times it has hit the table this past month.  Easy to learn and play, short enough to keep inteserest.  I haven't seen a kid aged 6-14 yet that doesn't like it.  It can still be challenging for an adult and fun enough to get Mom and dad to play with you.

Zunächst werden 24 Spielkarten gleichmäßig an die Spieler verdeckt verteilt. Ziel ist es, auf dem Brett mit seiner Spielfigur zu dem Feld zu gelangen, das die entsprechende Abbildung der Aufgabenkarte zeigt. 
Doch das Brett ist nicht statisch. Es besteht aus sieben mal sieben Labyrinth-Feldern, von denen jeweils drei Reihen an den Brettseiten variabel sind. Ein zusätzliches Spielfeld-Teil liegt immer neben dem Brett. Dieses wird zu Beginn jedes Zuges ins Brett hinein geschoben, wobei das gegenüber liegende Spielfeld-Teil vom Brett geschoben wird. Nach dem Verschieben der Reihen darf man die eigene Spielfigur so weit bewegen, wie man möchte und es bei der gerade gültigen Gangarchitektur möglich ist.

Well, I really like this game. 

The problem is: This game is marketed as a children´s game and I do not think this is a children´s game.

Despite of the childish graphics, this game can take hours to finish if played by children only.

It´s faster when played with adults, specially with our house rule that you do not have to come back to your corner after collecting all your items. This rule is too cruel, and makes the game to last a little longer than it should!

This is a clever, wonderful little game. The pieces are great, the rules are simple, and unlike many kids' games it actually has some strategic and tactical depth.

My daughter's four, so she doesn't completely get it yet (the box suggests 7+), but she has fun playing it. I use the suggested rule variant where she has her cards face up and I don't, and I also give her very few cards and me about twice as many.

As she gets older, I can see her picking up more and more of the game on her own, and I look forward to playing it with her often.

---

18 plays in, our handicap has shifted (now she gets the same number of cards as the adults, but can see them all at once; we can only see our top card), and the game remains solid and enjoyable.

RATING: 5.8
This game is pretty cute and is a good way to teach spacial relationships.  Basically it is a game where you race through a maze where walls and objects move to get your spell components before the other players do.  The walls of the maze move because each player slides a new card into the maze (popping out the one on the other side) each turn.  It's definitely a step above most children's games.

Game in a Nutshell: Shift tiles in a maze while opening up pathways and blocking others in order to reach different secret points.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: Super easy to teach and grasp. One of the most accessible games on the market for people young and old. Doesn't overstay its welcome. Such a simple mechanism creates a dynamic game that can be downright addictive from the first play.

Cons: There's a fair bit of luck in the way your cards are dealt out. Things could line up just right or be a pain in the butt... the winner, between two relatively competent players will generally be the one whose cards lined up the best. The chaos of the maze with more players may turn off some.

Other: As a kids game, it's not hard to see how it could wear out its welcome if played in high rotation. But that said, I think it will stand up to the repetition more than most games of its ilk.

Best Use: Excellent game for including grandma, the kids and everyone in between.

A good kid's game, but it's not a strategy game.  I can't see how you would plan ahead.  You just have to react.  There are several kids games like this (Hungry Ant, Atlantis, etc.), and I've been interested in them all.  If someone comes up with a good strategic version of a maze mechanic, it goes to the top of my list.  Octiles and Dragon Delta don't reach that level.

Not an amazing game, but challenging and entertaining. My son was 5 the first time we played (aborted play early) and 6 the second time. He liked it okay but didn't quite get the screw you part of playing. He did a much better job with the Harry Potter Halls of Hogwarts Game, which is similar, so maybe it was just the theme. MIGHT be willing to trade, but would prefer to keep to try with my son when he's older.
Now 8, he has asked to play once recently, and he did better, nearly beating me.

Yay!  Puzzles!  This is a great filler that fits a specific time slot.  The game is simple enough to be entertaining and I find that the skill it can teach is very useful for other puzzles and games.  Its lack of complexity prevents it from getting a higher score, and the game lends itself toward specific skill sets, meaning the same person will probably win.

A pretty good game to play with my 6 year old daughter.  We house-ruled it a bit which has made it more enjoyable for us:  We don't have any objectives in hand.  Instead, there is a line of objectives above the board with values 1 - 4.  We can go after any of the objectives on the line.  If we claim an objective, we get gem tokens equal to its value.  The remaining objectives slide toward the more valuable spots & a new objective is drawn and placed on the 1-value spot.  The first player to 16 points wins.

The tiles on the board are mobile. You push mobile tiles with the extra tile and then you can move your pawn along the corridors as far as you can go. You are given 3 goal cards and have to reach them in order (kids variant: they can look at all of them first). First one to reach all goals and return home wins. Sounds great!

I bought The aMAZEing Labyrinth to my little sister in one (of many) attempts to interest her in games. My intention failed but it was not due to this clever game that pleased the entire family.

The ever-changing game plan makes each turn interesting and gives several tactical opportunities, both when it comes to improving your own position and to disrupt your opponents'. Advanced gamers may find it too simple but as a family game it serves its purpose well.

A similar labyrinthian game with twists and turns is Tsuro, which I also can recommend.

Update: Not sold but lost after my sister moved and unless I get children, I see no reason to track down a new copy.

This kind of fell short for me. Once someone has found all their treasures, then everyone knows where they have to go (back to their start spot) So the person taking the turn before them just has to avoid giving them a piece they can win with (or a maze position they can win with). I finally ended the game on purpose because I saw no end in sight.

Simple rules.  Easy for all ages.  
Only played it twice, so far but find the end game a bit of a problem - because the final goal is known to all, and its in the best interest of everyone else that the leader not achieve it, we found the game bogged down at this point to an extended "Block the leader" game.

RATING: 6
Classic family game where players look for treasures spread over a labyrinth built by several tiles that changes its shape every turn as players slide a new tile into one row or column, displacing all tiles after it - the new tile out will be placed the next turn. The mechanism is clever but there's quite a bit of luck involved in the positions of the treasures and there aren't many options to choose from. This keeps the game from getting too complicated but also means that single wins aren't really filling unless the games are long and players plan for more than getting to the next treasure. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Most played game in collection.  Favorite of adults.  Thinky enough without burnout.  Modified kids rules: Play with dealing three cards, players good to choose which card they want to pursue, then back home after getting all three.  

Thank you, Ravensburger for well thought out games, quality components and great inserts.

Addictive fun. Easy rules, so great for new players and non-gamers. Good for gatherings as setup is simple and fast. This is often billed as a kids game, but we don't have kids and love it. No, it's not super meaty, but it is fun, especially if you like puzzles.

RATING: 7
The mechanics of this game are quite different from any other boardgame I've played.  It sort of feels like those scramble picture puzzles you can get.  Not much player interaction and it can be difficult to plan ahead as the board changes so much.  The more players there are the more difficult planning ahead becomes.  Can suffer a little from analysis paralysis for this reason.  One thing I do like about this game is that it can be played with children using a handicap system.  By allowing the child to look at a number of treasure cards, as opposed to only one card for an adult, challenging games can be enjoyed. An e-Bay purchase based on BGG ratings and comments.

RATING: 7.5
Acquired in trade, September 2007. Went over very well with my family. A very clever design, because of the artwork it looks like a little kids' game, but is anything but once you start playing. Two to four players are dealt an equal number of cards from among 24. Some tiles are set in rows and can't be moved; others (loose ones) are shuffled face down and randomly turned over as they are placed into the open spaces in the maze, thereby creating a different maze for each game. The first player looks at his top card; the picture on the card gives him his first goal, which he must move to through the maze. Players start at their respectives corners, which correspond in color to their playing piece. There is always one extra maze tile, so that on his turn each player shoves the tile into the maze, thereby moving one piece out. That piece becomes the playing piece for the next player, and so on. Players can't move into a tile space just moved out of the maze; players can end up on the same space as another player. The whole idea is to move tiles so that paths open up in the maze, allowing one to reach one's goal. When one reaches one's goal, that card is placed face-up and the player flips over his next top-most card for his next goal. The winner is the player who reaches all of his goals (cards) and then makes his way back through the maze to the corner from which he started. If you're good at jigsaw puzzles you'll probably be good at this game, too, although there is a luck factor depending on the draw of the cards. But this game features a nice blend between luck and skill. There is also a rule for younger players by which they can look at all their cards and elect which ones to use as a goal on their present turn. The only drag on this game can be a player who takes too long to analyze their next move. If that's the case, you might want to use a timer of some length to keep the game moving, because other players can lose interest waiting. But that's the only potential downside I see to this otherwise enjoyable game. My son Trevor, 10, rates it a 10 (10-27-09).

You have a secret objective to get to, and each time you do you draw your next objective, so there's no forward planning - just the here and now. Moves seem to alternate between really easy (you can get there) and too hard to assess - ie what's the best way to set up for next turn, getting closer to your objective and messing others up at the same time. This mix means there's mixed feelings throughout and the result is a bit of a lottery as well, with the game going to whoever happened to have the most easy gets. The kids thought it ok but weren't begging to play again.

I had this when I was a kid and I remember it being mildly entertaining then.  Move your piece around a shifting maze and try to get to your secret square.  It's still probably an OK kids game but I can't imagine enjoying it much now that I'm older.

TRY Sept/05: I liked how adaptable this game was for younger players to join in and compete, and I enjoyed the way everyone had different goals (versus Master Labyrinth, where everyone is trying to get the next number in the sequence) -- ie. virtually no blocking opportunities, which makes for a nice family environment (with kids under 10).

Played this in my after school club. Enjoyed the modular board and the weird creatures. As a game, it works quite well, although I never played it with actual gamers. It is a great game for kids and I wonder when someone will take the game concept and turn into an heavy game. Catan meets Heroquest maybe. It could be called Dungeon Escape and the players would have to escape the dungeon, being subjects to shifting tunnels/traps/monsters etc.

I really quite enjoy this little game.  It doesn't do a lot of things new or very clever, and is in fact quite random, but overall I like the game and it a wonderful little logic game, and would recommend it to most people
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really have difficulty with these kinds of spatial placement games - it hurts my head to visualise new configurations before seeing them move into place.
This makes planning tough, and basically changes the game into a co-op game (which isn't bad).
I just don't see how so many people say this is a great game for (young) kids, because many kids can't visualise the positions and strategize without moving the tiles into their places first. And moving the tiles is kind of a pain  because they constantly catch on the other tiles.
Upped the rating from 7 to 7.5 because when playing with only kids, they don't care if they make a sub-optimal move - just exploring the maze and getting some treasures if fun enough for them.

Labirinto é um jogo diferente de todos os outros, deve ser dificil obter um tabuleiro de jogo tão interactivo quanto este. A ideia está muito bem pensada, o tema assenta-lhe muito bem e a jogabilidade consegue ser forte para os crescidos e acessível para os miudos. Com uma mistura destes, temos um jogo agradável, que se joga num instante e de várias formas, com a particularidade que inspiraria Catan e tantos outros: Não há 2 jogos iguais!

This was (and still is) my kids' gateway (excluding The Enchanted Forest which we regifted). We still drag it out and play. As with most games I play w/my kids, we modify the rules (for the younger ones, I let them look at all their cards) and we speed up game play by reducing the number of cards. Kids like it and I haven't yet reached the point where I dread playing. Rating will probably end up going down as time passes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An interesting concept, but improved and made better with "Master Labyrinth".  With players going for separate goals, the game starts to feel like dueling solitaire where the only interaction is how the board might incidentally change because of another players move.

That said - this is a good game to play with kids.  Especially as it is easy to handicap between players.  Either give the more skilled player more cards and/or give the less skilled player the ability to see more cards when trying for the next item.

Master Labyrinth is more strategic and better, since you have more knowledge of other people's goals.  In Amazing Labyrinth it seems hit or miss whether you accidentally thwart or help your opponents, so I feel like why play this instead of Master Labyrinth?  But the basic mechanism of both games (shift the maze, then move) is cool.  As a long-time fan of Master Labyrinth (the good 1991 version), it was interesting and fun to play this earlier version, 2007-10-11.

RATING: 6
This is a cute tile game that is easy to play with younger children.  It teaches them to think about what the landscape of the board will be after opponents move.

Even with all adults, this can be fun in that you are more often trying to screw your oppponent's moves.  Cute art and since you can find this one for around $10 - $15 it's a great game to pick up.

RATING: 7
Rated 7 for being good at what it is:  a children's game that adults can enjoy playing, too.  Each player moves and changes the maze on their turn as they try to make their way to the treasures they need, making this much more strategic and engaging than the vast majority of children's games out there.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I didn't enjoy this much as a child, because with the "you must return home at the end" rule the game can be broken and never end.  Without that, it's quite a fun game, as I discovered when I played it again recently.

AKA Labyrinth

Central pile of cards - only  get one each to start.  When a player has collected their item they can take a card and if that new item is reachable immediately - then the player can move to it and collect it straight away.  They then take another card and repeat as above.  On 03-04-15 Mai got nine in a row!  If the revealed card is not immediately reachable then do not move.  and play passes to the next person.

We made our own sack pictures to put our loot in once collected.

Picked this up for a great price on clearance at Target because I had heard good things.  The quality of the game is what you would expect from Ravensburger.  Simple game play that entertains the whole family.  My only complaint is that almost everygame one player gets pushed into a situation where they simply can't make much progress and it's really easy to get frustrated if you are that player.  My wife thought she was brilliant the first few times we played because it never happened to her.  When it finally did she apologized for thinking we were overreacting when it happened to us.

This is the best way to teach kids about Analysis Paralysis.  This is a worthwhile kids game that is just too long and chaotic for adults to play.  I would certainly play this again as a filler with two or three players if you took out half of the needed victory cards and had a two face up in front of you that you are going for.  

I'm not sure that there is a good move in this, only ones that work or don't work, set ups that happen to last or get wiped out through no intention of others. The inadvertent chaos of the game is rather frustrating.

This is a great game for kids, and a fun game to play with kids.  The rules are simple, and the shifting map is a neat mechanic.  Adults will find it fun too - you can plan ahead and strategize how to obtain goals.  It's not complex enough for my tastes, but for a quick play with kids it's definitely a great game to have available.

A solid well playable game. The kids' option there is to allow them to open two or more cards to pursue at a time, this si likely enough to bring them up to the adult level.

I would have to say that this game along with "hare & the Tortoise" are my 2 favorite Ravensburger games! Truly innovative when it first came it out, it is still a great little strategy game. As is the case with all Ravensburger games, the components are first rate. While most folks probably percieve Ravensburger games to be for the younger crowd, this one is fun for young and old.

A fantastic, smart children's classic where you have to push tiles to create paths through the labyrinth to find the target items. For me, the first game with a changing board, high replay-ability. Not pitch perfect to combine with adults since they usually have an advantage but older kids (8-ish) and parents does work. You can play in 2 variants, either have one deck of target cards and all rush for the same thing or hand out a personal deck (or mix both). What can I say? It is great, a mix of abstract, planning and fun and, yes, a dose of luck. The design is pretty awesome, too.

Like the moving maze mechanic--its' very good.  Don't like the very significant role that luck plays--it seems one player always gets a couple cards where the symbols are nearly exactly where they need them to be.  Not particularly good for kids, unless you have a group of spacially gifted yougin'.  The adults in the group dont like the hefty luck swings, the kids and adults don't like the fact that your plans get foiled by moves the other players are making--no one tries to mess up the opponents, but it just randomly happens--similarly opponents can feed another player a victory unwittingly.  Not sure where the decent 6+ rating comes from!

Having found a complete version of this game in excellent condition for only a couple of bucks at a thrift shop, I decided I couldn't pass up the opportunity.  And I'm glad I didn't - when playing with the "Master Labyrinth" rules, it is a surprisingly challenging game despite it's minimal rules.  It reminds me of "Labyrinth: The Card Game", except it's a lot more fun.  I certainly feel like I've gotten my money's worth for this game!  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

A pretty decent kids game.  It has just the right amount of strategy and forward thinking for the age group.  What kid doesn't love the maze design or concept.  I find the 8 card play time a little long for what it is, but that's a pretty minor thing.  Well produced components, the raised board is quite innovative in recent editions.  It's a classic family game that isn't going away any time soon.

Nostalgia probably plays a part in my rating of this game, but I still consider it a solid entry. While terribly unbalanced (you may draw objectives very close to yourself while your opponent has to venture across the board) I see it as an interesting puzzle, and unique (tile pushing). Better played with having all three of your goals in your hand at the start of the game so you have more choice and can prioritise and adapt to the shifting board. It's always funny to see players try and hold it together and not let you know you just foiled their best laid plans.

Another of my daughter's favorite games way back when,  this one saw more playing time,  with more different people,  than any other.  It is that good.

In addition to getting me to play with her,  which is not any sort of a genuine accomplishment,  she could get the young,  the old and anybody in between to join her in a contest - and everybody seemed to enjoy it.

It's accessibility is only one of many reasons you should seek this one out,  should you ever have occasion to game with children.  Labyrinth,  simply put,  is just plain fun.

Clever and easy to learn.  It demands that you attempt to plan ahead by at least one move, but any more than that and you have to attempt to outguess your opponent or push them into moving the tiles in such a way that is to your advantage.  It seems the card draws can be random enough to make the game too easy for one player, and I could see the game devolving into a stalemate by one or more players who decide their only job is to stall the other players.  Only played it with two, but I imagine it to be much more chancey with each number more as the amount you can actually influence the board would dwindle rapidly.  Even so, quite fun and would make a great game for starting out the night.

Not that interesting and also not totally painless to play, so I dock it for that. No post-setup luck but there is hidden info and massive chaos, caused additionally by players having some dozens of possible moves to consider each turn. You really just try to naturally perceive [i]some[/i] move that will help you. You're not thinking about the other players because you don't even know what they're going for (and if you did it would make the task of determining your moves even harder).

Labyrinth is great fun - the board is always changing, and so your strategy has to change as well. The tension in waiting for the next person to make their move ups the excitement factor.

After teaching the little ones, they never asked to play it again. And I never asked them. One of these days, someone in the household will politely drop it in the thrift bag. Since it was brought into the house by Santa, we're all being too polite about it. One night soon, house asleep, I'll tip-toe downstairs and smuggle it into the garage. From there to a paper bag. Then the back of the van. A quiet stop at the thrift store; the big red box. Slip. It. Into. The. Thrift. Box. Hope the kids don't ask questions. If they do, change the subject to sex. Phew - close call.

Laberinto (antes El laberinto aMAZEing) ha dado lugar a toda una línea de juegos de laberinto. El tablero de juego tiene un conjunto de baldosas fijos firmemente en él; las baldosas restantes que forman la corredera de laberinto dentro y fuera de las filas creadas por los azulejos que están bloqueados en su lugar. Una baldosa siempre permanece fuera del laberinto, y los jugadores se turnan para tomar esta baldosa extra y deslizándolo en una fila del laberinto, que se mueven todas esas baldosas y empujando uno por el otro lado de la junta; esta baldosa recién retirado se convierte en la pieza para el siguiente jugador para añadir al laberinto.

Los jugadores se mueven alrededor de los caminos cambiantes del laberinto en una carrera para recoger diversos tesoros. El que recoge todos sus tesoros primera y vuelve a sus victorias espacio de la casa!

El laberinto es simple a primera vista y un excelente juego de puzzle de problemas para los niños; sino que también puede ser jugado por adultos que utilizan más estrategia y un enfoque más feroz.

RATING: 6
For an adult player, this game is too simplistic. I don't see a hearty session breaking out over it because it's usually easy to make the one slide and get to the next treasure. I think there was only one round when I didn't either get my next treasure card or get back to my corner (after I had uncovered all my treasure cards). However, if you're looking for a game that would be fun to play with elementary school age kids, this one would probably work well. It'll cause them to think about cause-effect and map out paths as they get their own treasures.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great family game to play with kids and there is some fun strategy in manipulating pathways...however, once a few players find "the main pathway" the game can become unbalanced (often it is easy to "fix" any messes if you aren't playing with multiple others designing to mess you up). Great for some quick fun...but not really for heavy strategy.

Great problem solving exposure, *well* fulfilled its mission of engaging young neice.  She asked for her own copy to play more frequently than just my visits.

Playing with kids my rating would be a nine. I actually do love the maze mechanic. For some reason, likely due to a genetic predisposition to getting directions muddled and confusing left with right, this game is a huge brain burner for me. For all the blood that gushes through my ears on this kids game, I'd rather play something with more long term strategy. Am I the first person on bgg to say the problem with a kids game is it is too hard for me :-)? hmmmm....

Labyrinth is a simple kid's game about a bunch of wizards running around a maze to collect a series of magical items. The first wizard to complete their magical scavenger hunt, wins.

Game play is simple. You shift an entire column of tiles vertically or horizontally, placing another tile in the empty spot. You then may move your wizard as far as you like, until it hits a dead end. Your opponent then takes the tile that was just displaced and repeats the process. In this way the wizards explore the constantly shifting maze and grab any quest items that they pass along the way.

It's not an amazing game by any stretch, but it does a great job of teaching kids to think spatially and to anticipate future possibilities. It also can be played a bit mean if the player's decide to do so, using their moves to mess up the paths of other wizards rather than build longer paths for their own. This additional layer allows a kid's game to be worthy of some grown up play, if you are willing to try it.

Wonderful game for younger gamers. The idea is that you are trying to accumulate treasures by moving around the maze. The maze is modified each turn by a piece that came out of the board last turn and is slide in, moving one of the rows or columns that can slide, thus causing the passageways to migrate along with the sliding tiles. The game is not complex, is fairly simplistic and even the a lighter game player can do well just putting the visuals together to make the best path or else ruin paths for his/her opponent. Very light fair though, not particularly difficult to learn in the space of about 2-3 minutes.

A wonderfully simple game that is perfect for families, especially those with young children and non-gamers.

All this wrapped up in a game that requires no reading and plays in about 30 minutes. Everyone should play this game at least once.

Labyrinth is one of the very few 'old school' games that are still relevant when it comes to the taste of modern board gamers.

That IS the game of my childhood. Although I wouldn't call it a game specifically designed for children. I bet a bunch of adults would have a great deal of fun while playing it. It is moderately complicated and inspires rivalry. Thumbs up!

A good game to play with children.  It is still involving enough to interest me as an adult however.  Navigate a maze while it shifts underneath your feet.

My 8 year old girls love to play this. It is fun, although quite straight forward. The moving of the maze keeps excitement high but strategic thinking is wasted here. Lovely parts and a cool maze mechanic let me give this a decent rating. Good for kids visualization and planning skills.

My 6 year old grandson really enjoys this and we enjoy it with him. A different game format which requires seeing and planning ahead. We always play where he can see all of his target cards, but we must look at them one at a time. This makes the game fair and close.

Upgraded rating to an 8. My grandson loves this game. It is fun as paths suddenly unfold or collapse with every turn.

A game I played a lot in my childhood, and I like the tactical gameplay and the ability to mess people over (or accidentally helping them) by warping them to the other part of the maze.

Just a good fun family game, with some moving maze puzzle solving that is not too difficult to play with 8-10 yr olds.

RATING: 7
A great game, but flawed in the fact that the board (although set up randomly), can ultimately line up for you to get all your treasures and back home in one fell swoop. The game is literally moving and shifting, combined with the simplicity of game play keep this a classic. Still gives a unique feel after 31 years!!

I'm not a fan of race-to-solve-the-puzzle.  Such games require perfectly matched wits, and if you find that partner, you'll want to play go.

That said, my children never tire of it.

Excellent game for teaching younger children spacial concepts.  I love playing this game with my 6yo daughter.  She loves to play to and can win some times as well.  Nice blend of luck with strategy.

A great family game that isn't boring for adults!

Rating of 9 for play with kids, probably a 7 for adults - average of 8.

Shift the maze one row or column at a time to navigate through and find your treasures.  Great game for kids (using slightly easier goals) and holds up well for older folks too.  An instant favorite in our house.

Received in trade (first english printing in fair condition) for part of a painted Warhammer Orc Army.

The instructions were missing, but based on my experience with the subsequent Labyrinth games, and optimizing to minimize backstabby frustration, I suggest that each player pursues a private, secret item. Once you find your item, keep the card as a point, and draw a new goal. It worked well, while keeping the path solving part of the game that defines the series.

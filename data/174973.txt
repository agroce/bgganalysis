RATING: 7.5
Solid on its own, but works better when mixed with the first game as the first game enables more spell usage. The biggest positives to this expansion is it ups the complexity of heroes, adds "animated" type artwork to duplicate cards, and increases player-versus-player interaction.

Pretty fun little game. Making combos with the rooms is interesting whilst adjusting to the random card draws. All in all it can feel a bit random at times.

RATING: 7
A decent, relatively quick card game with a lot of retro video game references.  The basic rules are easy to pick up, and being able to play cards to either mess with other players or help yourself is a great mechanic.  However, keeping track of all of the features of rooms, bosses, and spells can be overwhelming at times, especially later in the game; I've found this leads to a virtual stoppage of the game to explain what will happen this turn.

The deluxe edition of Boss Monster 2 is incredible. I love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Excellent theme ruined by fairly boring / uninteractive gameplay.

Issues I've encountered:

 - Boss "level up" skills are not balanced.

 - I would like to see more / better ways to draw spell cards.  I usually only get to play the 2 starting spells, and then rarely get to draw new ones.  This has an impact on the player interaction, because it heavily limits the pool of options.

 - Gameplay seems to be too random.  Once all dungeons are built, the type of Hero which will be attracted to each dungeon is for the most part established, so when new Heroes are revealed there is usually little you can do in just one build phase to change the Heroes' preferences;  This might be just because I'm bad at the game.

A decent stand alone expansion, better than the original, by a small bit.

No new rules, which is always good for this kind of thing. Just more variety, and any new mchanics are explained right there on the card.

The new hero types are especially nice.

I look forward to eventually shuffling this up with the original.

Game is ok, the theme is A+ nostalgia for the 8-bit era of video games but the game itself leaves something to be desired.  There is more take that in this set then the others it seems but it still all comes down to luck of the draw because if you don't draw the right cards, you can't do anything.  Just too often felt powerless to do anything about what is happening and even when the options were there, you had to again have the right cards to take advantage of it.

RATING: 8
I love this game. In my mind, it has lots of strategy and depth, but is relatively simple to learn and teach to others. This is another one of those games that I can get my wife to play. The theme is fantastic, taking me back to my 16bit video game days. The artwork is great and fits the theme perfectly. I own it all, Boss Monster 1/2 the extras, the mat, the lunch box. My only negative is that it's much better as a 2 player than 3 or 4.

Although it doesn't look to add anything too drastic (such as a new treasure type), the cards this stand-alone expansion plug a lot of gaps from the first release. Could still do with a few more uniquely attracted heroes. Offers an increased level of cross-dungeon interaction is a huge gameplay improvement that greatly increase the competition. Just not a fan of the way the Portable Pack is being handled (or the awful carry case, which I would have much preferred to see as a Munchkin-sized box, without handle, to better fit my collection).

RATING: 7.7
This game is basically the same as the original Boss Monster, but with a few nice twists (dark heroes that can be influenced by other players, hybrid heroes that select dungeons based on combined feats) and the great fact that the artwork of identical cards is often complementary and that some rooms make reference to the original game (Incubus Gym - Succubus Spa, Smashinator - Crushinator) or pop culture (the little kobold on the wrecking ball is pure gold). It made me grin while checking the cards and mixing the decks of both games up.

I also like how the new spell cards often have more versatile uses.

Plays exactly the same as Boss Monster 1, see my comment for that.

Improves the original game by offering increased interaction and decisions. The room and spell abilities are more interesting and there is greater diversity in heroes.

Among the cards that are included in this, the original, and tools of hero kind, I'm sure there is a great game ready to leap out. I don't know if I could be bothered sorting the cards out to find the exact combination needed to make that happen.

Played this tonight with a group of 4 and it was a lot of fun. However it did a bit long to get used to the rules and game play for the first 20 minutes, but after a few rooms were built we started getting used to it and had a lot of fun! Only took us about an hour to play the first run, but the next time we know the rules and game play I think it will only take about 45 minutes.

Moss Bonster and its sequel are both highly entertaining, mildly unbalanced homages to 8- and 16-bit gaming.  The cards are often very funny, and the "lure" mechanic can make for some interesting scenarios as players compete to have either more or less of certain treasure types, depending on what Heroes are threatening.

Kickstarted. Have the sleeve and shiny boss cards.

Just like the first game, you get a boss and draw cards to create a dungeon. You attract heroes to the dungeon and try to create a perfect killing machines - heroes that are killed give you points. The other players can try to interfere with your dungeon setups. 

I usually dislike "take that" type of games (my Munchkin years are long behind me), but this one limits the amount of trouble the other players can cause you. 

I'm a sucker for the pixel art and the creators clearly put a lot of care into it (identical cards actually have slightly different artwork on them, etc.). 

It's a stand alone game and is better balanced than the original Boss Monster. I recommend this one.

I'm missing a mechanic to have more control on the room/spell cards you get. As is, it feels very clunky and luck based with atleast 1 player per game really falling behind because his cards don't add up. And because the control on what you get is minimal, players aren't always able to interfere with each other like they are supposed to.
That being said, the art and the feel of the game IS great and the game is somewhat enjoyable. It's mostly the randomness that bothers me, especially as this is something they can fix. (Drafting mechanic, choosing top 2/3 cards, each player starting with certain "starter" cards that affect the possibility of gaining more of the cards you need/ build towards, giving players the option to go for a spell card/ extra room cards in exchange for not building 1 round, etc)

I have both Boss Monster and Boss Monster 2.  They're both basically the same game, but with different bosses and card abilities, so you can play both of them alone or throw the cards all together into one big deck and play together. 

In them, you're the boss at the end of an 8-bit side scrolling dungeon trying to stop the hero from getting to you.  You do this by playing room cards to build your dungeon.  This game pulled off the theme perfectly.

Read the directions carefully if you pick this one up, and pay close attention to terms.  I played 3 times before I realized I wasn't allowed to do something I kept doing.

I've played both Boss Monster versions mostly as one on one games. Boss Monster 2 is much better balanced for this style of play, and leads to tight, interesting to navigate, and unique games for hours on end.

Bit of "Take That!" but not as much as something like Munchkin (i.e. not enough to ruin it for me). Crash Landing will probably not get played anymore, adding that many people pushed the game too long and I really prefer it as a 1v1 game anyway.

Have Paper and Pixels, Tools of Hero Kind, Crash Landing.

Even though I initially thought this would be vastly superior to Boss Monster's somewhat broken gameplay (where the player who gets spells generally wins) the evening of the playing field takes away some of the tension, and you don't get those amazing wins where everyone gangs up on the spellslinger.  Still, a much more balanced game, though I wonder if losing the feeling of the original was worth it.

Love the theme, love the concept of being the bad guy destroying "good" heroes in my dungeon.

I really dislike that Boss Monster can easily let one player simply run away to victory without any chance of stopping them. Boss Monster 2 has made great strides to remedy this, but "run-away"s can still happen.

I personally like modifying the rules to find a more balanced start to help every player to have the same fighting chance.

You drop cards to grow a linear dungeon. Each turn heroes may be attracted to your dungeon, which is good if it can handle them and bad otherwise. If your hand leaves you with little hope of attracting anything, or doing the same thing as another only not as much, you're out of luck unless everyone else ends up biting off more than they can chew. Then there are various take-that effects, dependencies, ways to remodel your dungeon, and spells. Possibly better with just two players.

So it's the same game as boss monster one, how does it have a better score? More villains, more pop culture references hidden in the cards, while the game play is the same, I just have more fun with this edition and notice some new reference every time I play.

You are the titular boss monster of a platformer-style dungeon. You must construct your dungeon such that it's attractive enough to lure the heroes, but also deadly enough to kill them. You must also sabotage the dungeons of the other boss monsters, who have the same goal.

I didn't enjoy the first Boss Monster at all. It just seemed like a underdeveloped game, with perhaps a lack of play-testing. This version, on the other hand, seems to be more streamlined, quicker and not as luck-driven. To be fair, this version also relies on getting the right symbols at the right time, it somehow doesn't feel as heavy-handed. Plus, it's cute and light.

RATING: 5
Better than Boss Monster 1, but unfortunately doesn't have a lot of depth still. The Tools of Hero Kind expansion makes this game a lot better, but there are plenty of better 2-4 player games.

A standalone expansion to the original Boss Monster. while it doesn't actually add any new rules it does add lots of new cards that can be added to the original with even more geek culture references. Basically this takes everything the original did and does it better, well worth a look if you have the original or not.

Same rating as the first game, not a lot that feels all that different except maybe the star symbol on some of the heroes where opponents may discard a room card to give the hero more lives. But it mixes well with the original game, and there's nothing wrong with having more of the good stuff.

It's Boss Monster but, you know ... more of it. (Played one game as standalone, not with original Boss Monster.) New cards seemed a bit more balanced than before, and the very minor rule change provided a distinctly positive benefit to play.

RATING: 5
The original Boss Monster is a better game.  This game adds alternate play styles and weaker cards for more balanced play.  The original is far more brutal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well after the fact, this expansion does a good job of adding more content of the original style; as well as a few fun bits and pieces of new rules. 

Still not a game I jump to play, but when it comes to the table, it is a fun time for the folks involved.

The variety of Rooms and Heroes TNL adds to the game has really upped our enjoyment.
When combining the two sets, we use all rooms and spells, AWESOME variety!
For heroes: 1 Fool, 4 Dark Heroes, shuffle the remaining heroes and draw 8 for a total of 13.  Doesn't guarantee a balance of hero types, altering strategy. :)
Epic Heroes: We just randomly draw 9.

The theme of making dungeons to entice explorers reminded me of Dungeon Lords, which I haven't played, but I suspect this plays quicker. Not my kind of theme anymore, it was ok, I can see where the fun would lie in 'hit the leader' intent with hopefully some luck like I had to counter the leader bashing.

Boss Monster is a neat concept that fails in several ways. The process of taking your turn is overly complicated in ways that detract from the experience. The main draw is that you get to construct a dungeon as a video game boss, and you're competing with other players to defeat as many heroes as possible. You attract heroes based on the rooms you construct. The problems lie with limited interactivity with opponents along with how little time is spent building your dungeon and how long you spend sending heroes room by room waiting for other players to respond with spells to said hero entering certain rooms. Most heroes only have a health bar, and without anything like hidden abilities, the interaction between heroes and rooms is pretty much nonexistent. With too much tedious work and not enough focus on the fun elements of the game, it's not something I've ever been excited to play past the first couple of tries.

A mostly random, take-that style game with crappy 8-bit graphics that do absolutely nothing for me. If this version added more cross-dungeon interaction, I guess I might like the original version a bit better? But the basic mechanisms: draw a hand of rooms (placing one per turn), face randomly drawn heroes, screw around with other players' dungeons ... is not for me.

I am an 80's kid and Boss Monster 2 really speaks to my childhood in a very good way.  The side scrolling style of the game really embodies the 80's game genre.  I like the fact that you are essentially trying to kill the hero as it is usually the other way around.  Boss Monster 2 makes some good improvements over Boss Monster 1.  In fact I would recommend picking up Boss Monster 2 over getting Boss Monster 1 since you don't need the first to play the second.

Not sure if it was that I always played the first game with 4 players, the people I was playing with, or that the designers are now more experienced (I imagine all 3 are partially true), but I had more fun in each of the 3 plays of this game then I did playing the first. Overall, the rooms felt more balanced towards the early game. I felt like my dungeon dealt more damage but had less room to room interaction. It meant that I took less early wounds, but needed more luck drawing high damage rooms to stay competitive once the epic heroes came out.

This game is seriously square in the realm of the deck gods. If you get good room cards you are set. I love the theme so much, but the game play isn't too satisfying.

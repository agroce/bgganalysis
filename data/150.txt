Great fun with your drunk friends. More tactical than I first thought.

What I love about PitchCar is that it cannot be solved, i.e., there are no obvious "right" moves or so called no-brainers. This means that there is no limit to how good you can become. Sure, one can argue that PitchCar is not a boardgame in the first place, since you only flick your finger. In my opinion this is not true, because PitchCar also involves a fair amount of tactical decisions. For example, taking the fast shot is not always the best, since it might leave you vulnerable to overtaking, or you could be pushed behind obstacles. I also like that in desperate situations you can take greater risks.

In a nutshell, PitchCar offers great fun and decision making, and is not limited to just mindlessly flicking your finger.

It's certainly a lot of fun.  My boys (5 and 3) both love it too and my wife is happy to play it.  I'm sure that the lads who come around for a beer once in a while will enjoy it, too.  It certainly costs a few bob to buy (I got mine from Ebay) but I'm glad that I went for this rather than Pitchcar.  The wood is not that well made and it can chip a bit because it just chip-board underneath the surface, but even so it has to be better than plastic.  I haven't got close to mastering this one yet, but I'm going to enjoy learning!

WARNING: Sore fingertips! Broken fingernails!
But how much fun this is. 8 grown ups circling around a table (remove the chairs, you won't need them), cheering, yelling. 
Somehow it turns all players into kids again.
And you're never safe: I dominated the game once, led by 1 lap ahead of the 2nd, and then I couldn't do this jump anymore & lost the game. You know what: it was still a blast!

My favourite dexterity game - it's accessible, unlike Crokinole, which is like snooker in its barrier to entry for new players. 

It is slick and customisable, and allows 'bad' players to come back with aggressive flicking, leading to high drama.

This game is a BUNCH of fun. I would play this anytime anyone requests to play it. (Given than I can have a couple of hours to build a track because I like to get fancy) Unfortunately the game can be only as fun as everyone is evenly matched. I hate seeing people struggle to keep up when I am blazing around the track. If new players join, they probably won't be able to keep up for the first few games, but it isn't a huge obstacle to overcome. Also, people who have good hand eye coordination will have a higher skill level than people who don't. (obviously) I highly recommend implementing the extra flick rule. Also, there is a great word document on creative track obstacles. HIGHLY recommended!

A fun romp, best with lots of people.  Fitting the track pieces together is a pain.  The best solution we found was an old set of cards used as "shims" to prop the track up...  (eg: if going "right" around the track, make sure all the right ends of the track are a little higher than then left...)

Best of the dexterity games I have but setup and leveling out the tracks can be a pain in the arse.  Everyone seems to like it but although it works well with 2 this is best played with a group of people.  A board to keep track of turn order is essential to keep things turn order straight if running multiple races with qualifying laps.

A neat dexterity game. I wouldn't go out and grab my own copy of this but I'd certainly play in another casual tournament like the pre-Dice Tower Cruise one I played this in.

 So much fun flicking those cars around the track. Seems like it's just crash after crash for us though. It's just a pity that it costs so much. The price really is a bit much.

I love this game so much; I suck SO hard. My aim is deadly accurate, but I always underestimate how hard I'm pitching the cars and wind up magic-missling them all over the room. If toy stores hired PitchCar snipers to discourage shoplifting then I would surely be one of the elite.

The only trouble I have bringing this to the table is that the table normally isn't big enough (though this isn't necessarily a criticism of the game itself.) Some day, I will buy a table specifically for this purpose, massive enough to build a PitchCar track with all of the extensions, and I'll just leave it set up all the time. Some day...

As a dexterity game, it holds little interest to me.

The production value is extremely high; with a lot of people it's a fun party game/ice breaker/whatever, but ... it's a dexterity game. I play board games for the mental interest, not my physical dexterity/talent. Oh well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a dex game, this is really solid.  Game play is fast, the more players the better.  Lots of options. The tracks and the difficulty depend quite a bit on what expansions you've got and how the guard rails are set up.  If there are too many rails, the game can tend toward dull as players will simply flick hard and hope to ride the rails around.  On the other hand, if the guard rails aren't in the right place, the game can crawl to a halt as players struggle to inch forward (literally).  Worth getting expansions for and a fun game in the collection.

Played the Pitchcar version at Gamstorm 14 (2012).  With 2 of the base game and one stunt car you can make a pretty big track.  

Need to remember that 1) when the car goes off the track you reset it to the starting point. 2) When you flip but stay on the track, you lose your turn.  That's all there is to it.

a wonderful "skill and action" dexterity game.  The only sad thing is that it (and even more sadly it's expansion) is out of print.  Can be played without the expansion for great fun, but the expansion adds alot to the flavor of the game.  A racing game that should be strongly considered.

I am getting old, so this kind of games are slightly getting out of my comfort zone... ehm, who am I kidding?!? I played Carabande in my early twenties in a local club, and I had a blast! And now I can't wait for my daughters to grow up and play PitchCar with me!!!

Initial Impression: This is a finely produced dexterity game. The racing theme fits well with the game. Although the setup time may be a bit on the long side, everyone has fun helping build the tracks. The game is simple to teach and doesn't last long. More players result in more interesting races with the potential to block other racers.

I have really enjoyed Pitch Car. It's a great deal of fun and anyone can play it.   The fact that there are several ways to set up the board allow for a hig level of replayability.  I have had difficulties with "Lips of Doom" on slightly uneven tables, but most of the time those just add to the fun as we laugh at the person (generally me) who can't seem to get over without flipping their car.  Highly recommended if you can find it and enjoy dexterity games.

Fun but the pieces do not slide no where near as well as I would hope for,i expected them to slide like in crokinole however they do seem to drag a little and you also need lots of space for making bigger and more epic courses. I do enjoy the game but do feel it could improve with better slideability on the roads,i have used the glide powder from the website but still not has glidey as I would like

RATING: 7
Provides a lot of fun, especially for 6-8 players.  A lot of laughter, groans, and cheers.  Great for all ages.  Many of my gaming buddies and I like to dissect a game and the strategies that were used after the game is over.  What to be said after PitchCar?  "I flicked it badly!"  I think I read a fellow BGGer describe this game as one with a lot of empty calories.  Fluff has it's place, however.  Will be played often, but only when the scene is more party-like.

This game is a sure-fire hit.  I knew it would be.  I actually hesitated to introduce it to my kids, because I'm afraid that it will make them forget about all of the other games that we have to play.  We'll see how that goes.

The entire family loves this game, including my reluctant gamer-wife.  Once she realized that she was going to be flicking these tokens around the track, she got into it with gusto.  Soon she's arguing rules with my sons -- a sure sign that competitive juices are flowing!

The track itself feels rather short, but it does take up the entire table.  I can see how some people would be motivated to purchase multiple sets to make even more interesting tracks.

RATING: 6
Update: I've played this and I was not overly impressed. I have much better and more interesting disc flicking dexterity games. It's an expensive set for so little game. It needs more. I don't mean more challenging tracks. I mean it needs more interesting turn options. One of those expansions should have been to add combat and item pickups to the track. I'm sure this game rates high and is popular for a reason, but having played great dexterity games like Catacombs, Disc Duelers, Cube Quest, Dungeon Fighter, and Micro Mutants, I have to say that this one just fell very flat for me. Even Caveman Curling is more fun, in my opinion.

Aside from the mostly bland gameplay, I will say that the components are very high quality and feel like what could be a great toolkit for creating my own rules for vehicular combat.

BEFORE PURCHASE: Disc Duelers has a racing variant which may mean I don't need this one to fill that spot in my games.

PitchCar.  Two playings (one with 5 and one with 4) with my gaming group, and 2 with the family, all base set only, no expansions.  More fun than I expected, approached as a "lets have fun" game.  Everything you read about it is true - leveling the tracks is arduous, the rails pop out from time to time... and yet, its a great deal of fun as a closer or opener.  The one exception is that the game really doesn't seem to take up the gobs of space that are implied by other comments, at least with just the base set.  In fact, I need to get the expansions so I can get all the track closer to the table edge for my 5 year old...

This is a great start or end to the night, any time you want something just quick and fun.   

My 5yr old loves it and my 3yr old can play with some skill so it is also a great adult/kids game.

It will never take the place of my higher ranked games but I will also never refuse to set it up and run a couple of quick games.

I LOVE this game!  Its lots of fun, but I need the expansion to make it more fun!  
The one problem I have found is we have to put papers under some of the connection points (like wedges) to make them flatter so the pieces dont get caught on them and make them flip off the board.  But thats not too bad, the game its self is really fun!

My daughter loves this game! She has been asking for the expansions and has a ton of fun helping me build tracks and racing. She likes to grab Nerf rival ammo (small balls) and use those instead of the discs. It makes things a lot harder.

Every one I play this game with (wide variety of guys at work) pretty much all ask "when are we playing again?" To my knowledge I've instigated purchases of two base sets and three expansion packs so far by other people! And more still expressing interest. Just a super fun game that anyone can enjoy.

I've played this several times at Cons, and I agree that it's fun for a while. But as far as flicking games go, it doesn't hold my interest as much as, say, Crokinole, and it certainly isn't worth the price people are asking for sets. If you want to play a cheap imitation, try using an old Tyco race track and some checkers.

My comments are for Carabande; I've only played PitchCar a few times, but the games do have a different feel to them - the track for one is a little faster than the other. I don't recall which is which. With the new expansions, I'm actually considering upgrading my set and selling my copy of Carabande. I like them, but not so much I need 3 copies (I have PitchCar Mini as well, and that may actually be my favorite version).

This is a very fun game, best of the dexterity/co-ordination games I've played. One caveat: some players are a bit obsessed with the monster tracks, but unless you are a real pro it's best to stick with small (one set and the expansion) tracks with a modest difficulty level, or the game can bog down and be less than interesting. The basic set plus expansion really is an ideal length. If the pack breaks up into a string, the game becomes a lot less interesting, and very tough jumps or missing rails can make the game more frustrating than fun.

I actually own Pitchcar, but for some reason, you can only save it under "Carabande".  It should have it's own ID, since it's not even compatible.  Fun and incredibly addictive!  I rate it a 9 with the expansion and an 8 without.  I own 2 sets of each the base and extension sets, so the long tracks are a blast!

Addictive, fun gameplay that even grumpy old curmudgeons should enjoy. It's big flaw is that it takes forever to setup and all of the extra, outside work doesn't flow as smooth as the game itself. 

For instance, the rules instruct each player to perform an individual time trial. This sucks with larger groups as it takes forever and you just want to get to the race.

Any game in which cheers and high-fives are mandatory seems like a winner to me. Great light dexterity game. Quick, addictive, scales well. Just by reading about it, you already know if it appeals to you or not. Sometimes has a slight runaway leader problem, but this is usually mitigated by how easy it is to screw up and can be eliminated by playing multiple rounds and keeping score. The rules for the pre-game heat are a little ridiculous (although, they can be nice when playing with only two since it allows players to become familiar with the track)... it just adds too much unnecessary length and "downtime" to a short, light game. And you're supposed to redo it if you die? Ridiculous! Just roll a die.

RATING: 7.5
This is actually surprisingly fun/tense, even with 3-4 plays, although ”the more the merrier” is a term that suits this game. 
Sure there is some luck whether or not your car hits a little bump on the road and thereby flips over and you therefore have to start over, but basically this is still a game of dexterity skills and the better player will often win.

The game design and concept is smart and innovative, but the basis game is slightly dry/boring; the game is much better and more fun with the expansions. However, this is going to be a hindrance to the game because the game is VERY expensive, and the expansions are too. Secondly the game takes up a LOT of space, especially if you’re going to add the expansions. Still, those factors haven't been  a hindrance to me as I've bought all of the expansions as well as an extra base set and expansion 1+6... just to have more tracks! 
I am even in the process of building custom tracks (i.e. drilling holes in a track, adding "pins" on another etc.) which is something that adds to the game. And it's not something I usually do with games, but I think Pitchcar is a good fit for custom made pieces. And speaking of this, I'm actually starting to assemble a lot of stuff in order to be able to play "Mario PitchKart" - it's going to be awesome!

The game is very easy to teach and plays in about 10-30 minutes (depending on the number of players, the length of the track and the number of rounds (we usually play 3 or just 2 if it's a long track). I highly recommend this game, especially with the expansions!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you have the table space, this is the one to go for. It's a bit more forgiving than PitchCar Mini as the track is bigger and the pucks are heavier and therefore easier to control. The bumps caused by joins (different sets can differ fractionally in thickness) can be very annoying though and if not carefully levelled can cause pucks to fly off due to the bumps. I use blobs of blu-tac to level the track and keep the jumps from shifting around. The fences also have a habit of popping out which is a nuisance. Ferti's rules are very poorly written so it is no wonder that everyone who I play this with interprets them differently.

Some suggested house rules/rules clarifications:
1. If in a hurry to get started, use the furthest car after three flicks qualifier rule.
2. If cars don't manage to cross the start line (and remain on the track) then move them temporarily to the the side of the track to allow cars later in turn order a chance to make a clean start. Place these cars back on at the start when it's their turn.
3. Play order is decided by position. Cars furthest forward go first. (The rules simply state that, "Players play in turn").
4. Cars may jump any number of track sections provided they overfly at least a portion of them and miss no more than one completely.
5. Cars finish when they have completely crossed the finish line and remain on the track (whether face up or face down). If you'd rather they just touch the line and have to be face up, that's fine but everyone should agree beforehand.

Variant: Each time a car completes a lap, the player removes a barrier of their choice.

This needs fairly evenly matched players and the first expansion set to really shine. With the right crowd this is a hugely enjoyable game. Works very well with a wide range of numbers and as a tournament game.

A racing dexterity game that I really enjoyed playing. The game is definitely fun, and can be rather difficult depending on the track layout that has been built. Flick your discs to move your car and try to get it as far as you can without either you or your opponents going off the track. Only potential concern is as you build more complex tracks I still think inexperienced players or bad flickers will wind up far behind taking out much of the race feel. Having played big brother and seeing how crazy it is on a table, I am happy to have Mini as I think that will be a much better fit for the space that I have. I look forward to setting this up the next time family is in town.

(Pitch car) I had a lot of fun playing this when it all came together, but there was some work involved getting there.  Rails being glued, track sections smoothed out, etc.  Seems like they could design the track in such a way that the cars aren't as sensitive to very minor bumps.  I really like to be able to have the cars sail around in a consistent fashion, without having to worry about a bump messing everything up.

I have Pitchcar, which is a blast! I don't know that its really a game, however. I would term it more of a toy. But playing Pitchcar seems to appeal heartily to regular gamers. I expect we'll have some gaming nights where we play a big tournament with multiple track configurations.  

I also used this at work in conjunction with a medical review test. Divided into 8 teams, each team had to answer each multiple choice question...a correct answer earned your team a flick.  Very compelling and went over fantastically.  We'll do it again.

Carabande is one of those games that I cannot rate highly, because I would never buy a set, or make a point of playing it, but it is a nice dexterity game to just play around with if you find it set up on a table at a convention.

Flick your car as quickly as possible around a modular course and try not to let the divets in the track (speed bumps) throw you off onto the floor and fiery doom. There are generally some thrilling rail riding shots, and a few pieces precariously hanging over the edge as well, which adds some interest.

Simply put, not a bad dexterity game. Not up there for me with titles like Villa Paletti, which I would actually request, but fun. Only tend to play this at cons where copies are often set up and left out over the course of a weekend.

Family game

I have grown to love this very silly fun game. The only reason it is not a 10 is because of the uneven joins between pieces (or the long set up time to ensure there aren't any).

Mindless fun. My enjoyment may be in part because I don't suck at it because I'm sure it would be frustrating if I did. So far two wins from two races. The only place where formula 1 tracks include jumps that I know of. 

I might like it even more if I was playing with a group of approximately equal skill.
I reckon 4 players with two cars each would be a hoot.
I think I will give this idea to the Manual Arts classes and have them make this as a simple project. It will be MUCH cheaper.

Pitchar is awesome in its simplicity. You lay down a track, flick some discs and see who wins. Pitchcar works great as a party game, with gamers, with non-gamers, with elderly or with children. And it's fun. Every time. The game is on the expensive side, but I've yet to regret my purchase.

Build a track and race around by flicking wooden discs... brilliant!  Building a track is half the fun, especially when you just make one up rather than following a pre-planned track.  Then comes the fun of trying to master it!  It seems so simple but watching people make amazing shots is too much fun.

My only complaints are that the rails tend to pop out from time to time and you need to go through the track before racing to look for uneven seams; I put a few playing cards underneath the track segment to raise it up a bit and all is good.

Pretty minor though and certainly doesn't affect the overall fun factor.

Picked this up in summer of 2012.  We couldn't find it at any FLGSs, so we ordered it online.  We purchased a base game and liked it enough that we purchased a bundle online that included another base game and all of the expansions.  We need to have a bigger playing area to fully utilize the expansions.  This game is pulled out as a break between our heavier games, but is usually a pretty good time.

+ De schijfjes worden verplaatst door te flikkeren met je vingers. Elke vinger mag worden gebruikt. 
+ Als je schijfje van de baan gaat of omkantelt, leg je het schijfje terug op zijn originele positie. Als je schijfje een schijfje van een andere speler van de baan duwt, plaats je beide schijfjes terug op hun originele plaats. Nu is de volgende speler aan de beurt. 
+ Wanneer je schijfje te dicht bij de barriere ligt, mag je het schijfje van de kant leggen (volgens de dikte van een schijfje).

Fun light-hearted fare. Easy rules that most anyone can play and learn. That said, I prefer Crokinole, though this game is similar in purpose, it is different in style. The components are reasonably nice, but I would have really liked to seen the rails cut to a little more correct length. I have several rail pieces that just aren't quite right (too short/too long) to fit into the track pieces. In addition, my biggest pet peeve about this game is that a lot of the rails don't really stay properly in the groove of the track sections. Another very minor point is that my full-sized Pitchcar game came with the rulebook for Pitchcar Mini. As far as I can tell, the rules are nearly identical except for the color of the rulebook and the titles on the rule pages referring to Pitchcar Mini rather than just Pitchcar, so it's not really a huge deal, but I still feel a little cheated by the publisher because of the obvious substitution due to supply issues. Good game, but it suffers a drop of about a rating point for component quality control. The components aren't really bad; they're actually pretty decent quality, but I still feel like an extra level of quality control would have made this game really shine.

Woo hoo!!  A game for all the family that doesn't require rules lawyers for interpretation.  Simply set up the track and flick your car round the bends; hours of fun.  You can play nicely or aggressively (aiming to knock opponents off the track or penalising such actions) and the skill is as much physical as mental (do you flick or push?, go for the long run or block a chicane?).  Best played with beer if with your more mature friends, or on hands and knees on the floor if with the kids (harder to lose the cars if they can't fall off the table).  This will always be one of my favourites.

There are a couple of point that annoy me with this game - the bumpers that can pop out at critical times and the lips that can form when putting two track pieces together.

Still, a great concept and expansions only make it better.

While this game has more physical problems (the sections don't knit vertically as well as you'd hope, and the rails are bit too eager to pop out of their slots) than it should be able to get away with for its price, it's nonetheless quite fun to play every time I do.  A nice mix of mental and physical skill.  I suppose there's no true luck involved, but of course physics are chaotic enough that it feels like there is.  A great kid-pleaser!

I always have a blast playing this game.  

Base rating: 6
With expansion 1: 7.5
With expansion 2: 8
With long straights: 8.5
With stunt race: 10
With two stunt races: 11, hehe, j/k
The cross is mostly just a convenience.

What can I say?  It's expensive, but with all the expansions it's an absolute 10.  Each one just makes for than many more opportunities for even greater and more terrible shots.

There's a couple things we've found greatly improve the game:

1) use playing cards to make sure the track intersections in the direction of travel is slightly higher or equal to the next section.  The game really shines once you learn to build a reliable track.

2) play from 1st position to last rather than turn order.  It's more intuitive and doesn't give a huge advantage to those ahead.

텀블링 다이스와 피치카, 이 두 게임만 있으면 왠만한 모임에서 분위기는 확 띄울 수 있습니다.

개인 성향에 따라 텀블링 다이스를 좋아하는 분이 있고, 피치카를 좋아하는 분이 계시더군요.

피치카의 단점이라면, 거리 차이가 많이 날 경우 생각보다 따라잡기가 어렵다는 점입니다.

하지만 확장이나 하우스 룰 등으로 커버 가능한 부분이긴 합니다.

어쨌든, 트랙을 설치하는 것만으로도 많은 사람들의 흥미를 끌고, 알까기 레이싱이라는 테마를 잘 살린 수작임에는 틀림없습니다.

Great fun provided you got the right tracks. With just the base set alone there is a very limited set of track tiles and beyond the fist couple of games I guess at least some extensions are pretty much mandatory.

Also, make sure to have no unintentional bumps in the track at the tile transition points. That kind of ruins the fun.

 An excellent dexterity racing game. Take a little time to set up each piece and shim it properly and be rewarded with a wild game as you (flick) race your car around the track(and your opponents) to the finish line.

Good to know a new version has been created (Pitchcar) though the pieces are not compatible with Carabande.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pure fun in a (heavy) box.  Always draws people in when it's set up, and everyone I've played it with has a great time.  Having to level out the track pieces using playing cards each time is frustrating, and increases the already lengthy setup time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great fun, and with a few expansions, you can build som nice tracks. Some complain about that there fingers hurt, others that there racecar is not sliding so good. But when the race is on, everybody seems to enjoy it. It takes time to build a track though.

I've played this game before. It's a great between game filler to let your brain recharge. It's fun, it's simple, but challenging. The greatest complaint is that the setup is a bit long for playing it one or two times, but it's still not terribly so.

PitchCar is exactly what it looks like: a game where you flick your "car" (disc) across a track, desperately trying to make it to first place.  As a fan of cool looking games and also dexterity (flicking) games, PitchCar is solid.  Funny enough, there are very few rules governing its play, which makes some situations a bit unclear.  Overall, this game probably plays out a bit more as a fun racing game rather than as a true skill game.  For a true skill flicking game, I leave that label with Crokinole. But the "wow" factor of PitchCar can't be beat and it's a nice way to spend 30 minutes or so.  Great for non-gamers too!

This is a hit with just about everyone but it only tend to come out at high days and parties. You need a table that you can walk all around to be able to play properly.

RATING: 10
The fact that my kids are getting old enough to play this (with a few extra flicks for the younger ones) only ups the replay value for me. Yeah, it was a major investment and the price is SIGNIFICANT, but I sold a bunch of comics to pay for it and the expansions and haven't regretted the decision for a second. People LOVE seeing this laid out and are intrigued that something like this can be a game. I always get asked what it is, where I got it, what it's made out of and all the other questions that only help validate my taste in games.

It can get stale for some people, but I'll just go find other people to replace those people. I've played it on the floor, the dining room table and across multiple tables. The options are endless and I can even get my 90+-year-old Grandma to play it. This has been one of my best heavy investments and has managed to be the only "racing" game I can seem to win fans with. A rare 10, but a well deserved one at that.

I know this is part of the canon, but what made it stand out for me was one very small thing: it's a disc-flicker where you try NOT to hit other discs. That alone gave it an entirely different feeling from all its closest cousins that I've played.

I used to be put off by the work of building a track. But it seems like a decent way to get a group of casual gamers' attention while they are getting around to noticing that they're at a game night.

I learned to play PitchCar with the Mini version of the game, and at the time the full version wasn't available. As soon as I found out that it was back in production I ordered a set and started planning to gradually get all the extensions. 

It's my flicking game of choice. I'm not particularly good at dexterity games, but it doesn't matter with PitchCar because I always bring it out as something light, fun, and usually unique to the people I'm introducing it to. It's a perfect opener--simple rules, visually appealing on the table, and fun.

So much fun!  A must have game that draws people in!

Silly thoughthammer shipped this in such a way that the components ripped the box to bits.  Ok, I take that back.  Silly production values mean this game probably very rarely ships without busting out of the box.  Shame really.

After playing it a few times by myself to shape my technique, I thought that there's no way that this is  a '10'. However, after playing 4 games with my son, I have to give it a 10. After playing with more people at my regular gaming group, I'd love to give it an 11!

Decreased from 9 to 8 after trimming down games rated 9.

Initial
Great fun.  Flick circular wooden discs represetning cars around a track.  If you go off, you go back to where you started.  If you flip over you miss a turn.  Three laps make up the race.  Features such as chicanes and jumps add to the fun.

RATING: 5
Sadly disapointed with this one.  Gameplay is monotonous (flick. . .flick. . .flick) and having to physically move around the table to flick my car is inconvenient.  Neat concept though.  I play it mostly with my kids, and for something different.

RATING: 7
This is a great flicking game.  With 2 or 4 I would play crokinole but otherwise pitchcar is great.  Only downside to the game is that it is expensive and takes a considerable amount of time to set up and take down.  The expansion with the jumps is neat to try once but adds a lot of luck to an otherwise fairly skill based dexterity game.

This is a great family game.  It doesn't see too much 2P action, but my wife and I often play with 2 cars each when we do.  I requires a big table to accommodate the base set and 1 expansion.  I own expansion #2 and will probably pick up the stunt race and long straights at some point.

RATING: 8
This is a fast playing dexterity game.  Players may position their "car" to "snooker" you, so there is more strategy then meets the eye.

Unless you're really bad at dexterity games, it's always possible to come back from behind to win!

A game can be played in about 15-20 minutes with 4-6 players.  This is a big plus, especially when compared to other more detailed games which take 2-3 hours to play.

Last but not least, it's a game the whole family can play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I'm more of a stacker when it comes to dexterity games, this is my favorite flicker so far (mind you, I've never played Crokinole). The multiple tracks that can be created as well as the possibility of playing up to 8 makes this game a whole lot of fun for gaming with a few brews or with a few brats. This game is just fun.

RATING: 7
I'm glad I upgraded to the full size version as it's superior to mini in every way.    A blast to play with gamers, non-gamers and kids.  Only a bit of a long set-up time keeps tihs one from getting played more.

I learned some counterintuitive things about this game in my one play of it. One, bigger is not better. Better to play a short track than make a huge one that looks cool but leaves people wanting to quit after one lap. Two, skip the big jumps. They look fun, but they're not, especially when players pile up behind one and spend turn after turn getting in each other's way. Anyway, the game got some laughs but a lot of frustration as well. Neat concept though. I think for a flicking game I prefer Snapshot.

This is a light, dexterity game where you are flicking wooden disks around a race track.  Also known as Pitch Car.  I'm thinking about picking it up for something different.  There is a whole debate about getting the Carabande version or the Pitch Car version though.

This is a great dexterity game, and always popular with the under-teen crowd as well.  
It is simple, and intuitive.  I have the expansion which adds a jump and 2 tight tracks.  You can make small trackes to monsters, and go for 1, 2, or three laps.

Downside:  Its simplicity sometimes scares adults away.  The joints in the track can sometimes "catch" cars.  Finally, I don't have any of the Pitch Car expansions, and don't know if they fit.

RATING: 7
A dexterity racing game, that relies on a player's physical flicking ability, sort of like a game of Marbles. Flick too hard, and your car goes flying off the track into a fiery inferno (well, not really, but that's what it feels like). Flick too soft, and you just fall further and further behind. There is no better gamer high than flicking your car with just the right amount of force, banking off the walls to come from behind for the win. Its a perfect con game.

Update (01/22/12): Initial rating was an '8'. Do I want to own this? No. Do I have a sense of urgency to play this? No. Downing to a '7'.

Great fun.  Kids seem to really like it and you can mix adults and children in the same game without any problems.  It's a good way to get people up off their chairs and moving around and it's a nice warm up or cool down game.

It does require quite a bit of space on the table and also around the table for people to move and take their shots.

I have the PitchCar version and I must say there really isn't any other game like this out there.  If you have lots of buddies over (and maybe some alcohol) then this is your go-to game.  It's a riot when cars start flinging off the track and straight up in the air.  Sometimes you'll get stuck in a rut and sometimes you'll pull off a miraculous come-from-behind shot to land you in first.  Basically, the game is one helluva toy for geeks like me.

2. It can play a ton of people. 
3. The rules are simple and easy to explain. 
4. Everybody loves it and has a blast with it.

[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28018119#28018119]I find the original PitchCar lacking and overpriced, and so designed my own track shapes and cut them out of PVC with a CNC router. I replaced the grooves and sidewalls with holes, furniture pegs and rubber bands, which further enabled a wider variety of track building options.[/url]

Next step will be the addition of jumps, and beyond that, new track pieces that will enable Mario Kart style battle mode. Complete with different weight classes and weapons.

[b]MANDATORY HOUSE RULES:[/B] Two flicks per player per turn. If you fall off on your turn, you lose your next flick. If you knock off any number of opponents on your turn, you gain an additional flick that turn. Hence the name [i]BitchCar[/i]

All of which minimizes traffic jams, speeds up the game, creates opportunities for underdogs, and enables more interactive tactical options per turn for maneuvering around the other flickers.

Great game with a large group and some table space, very light (no thinking required really) but very fun.

Much better with expansion if it includes the jump and the more people the better as well. Right up there with Crokinoe as a fav dexterity game.

I will be trying a variant where knocking the other player off the track DOES NOT make you start over unless you go off the track too. This will help stop the leader which can be hard to catch and come on now... let there be SCREWAGE!!!

Finally got this after a long wait. Rails kept popping out, especially the corners and without even touching them, so I had to glue them. No English translation with the game, only French, but I wouldn't expect any less from them. With the glued in rails, they no longer fit into the box so it's now stored in a nice Rubbermaid container which will also help protect it from humidity.

**UPDATE**  The rails popping out has plagued me since I purchased this.  No matter the glue I use they pop out when they're bumped, especially the corners. It's to the point that I have trouble getting the rails in the slot due to the glue built up. Very frustrating.

CABS owns Carabande, which I think should have a separate entry in the BGG database (the pieces are incompatible).  Dexterity games like this don't seem to come out very much, but I would probably play more if they did.

Initial Rating: 5.5  (October 2013)

I don´t like racing games, so my  rating of 5.5 speaks of a good game. Pitchcar is perhaps the best racing I have played. It is really simple to teach and play, and with the correct crowd, it can be a blast.

The game components are great, and the game is gorgeous when assembled. I recognize it is a good game for many people, (gamers and non-gamers)  but it is not my cup of tea.  It can be a drag (for me) to assemble an unassemble the tracks, also it is heavy to transport (moreover if you have all the expansions).

In conclusion, Pitchcar is a good game, but not one I particularly enjoy. I would play again from time to time but I won’t seek more plays of this nor I will buy the game

Current Rating: 5.5
[hr]
2013-12-05

After another play, I’m downgrading its rating. The game can be fun, but I don’t like racing games. I would play again but I will always offer resistance against the suggestion. Still most friends like the game and I cannot deny that the game components are great.

Current Rating: 5.0


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It really shouldn't be fun.  However, it is strangely addictive and plays fast enough, so why not.  Skill does count for something but easily accessible for a variety of ages and skill levels.  Now where is my expansion track already? I need a jump!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just got this recently. Had a few laps with my wife, and also with my 3yo daughter who has the most fun pushing her car *off* the track and throwing her hands in the air saying "oooohhhhhhhhhhh" with a big smile. (Of course she can't flick with her finger yet so she uses the back of all her fingertips at once.)

Seems like a fair bit of fun. Takes a few minutes to set up. (My daughter enjoys assembling the track.) We've been playing on the carpet, and that introduces a couple of "hazards" in a circuit where the ends of two bits of track don't quite meet. I don't consider this a particularly bad thing, but we'll set up on a hard surface next time anyway.

The rating could move after more plays but I must say that I VERY much enjoy playing it and it is rare to find ANYBODY who doesn't want to play. It really brings people in. 

Plus, it supports the idea of regular gaming very well. You could have one race a week and keep track of performance in a type of "league" or "circuit."

I strongly recommend it.

The setup time and the enormity of the game are the knocks on this one.  It is undoubtedly a neat flicking game...probably best with 4 plus players.  Buy this if you have the space and a group who enjoys flicking games otherwise play catacombs or caveman curling.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
$150 for this??? I expected a lot more action instead of the TEDIOUS set-up shots you have to take because anything fun sends your car off-track and costs you a turn. I'd install better guard-rails and a slippery board, it's a CAR RACE for God's sake! It's supposed to be fast and exciting not slow and tedious. F the F.

RATING: 4
Manual dexterity games and I don't get along.  'Flick'... off the track again!  'Flip'... move disc 3 cm.  'Flick'... was that Mike who just lapped me?   How can a game be fun, if you have absolutely NO chance of winning?

"Ahhhh, what the heck, bring me another beer... let me try again."

Why not? This game is a bit pricey, but you get quality components, and a fun social experience. Just make sure you keep track of turn order really good... We all know that one gamer that claims it's their turn, and with 8 people socializing, they might just pull ahead...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was an enjoyable experience, and is short enough that you can play multiple games in a row - even with full compliment of people.  But for me this is more of a toy used for amusment rather than a game.  Don't get me wrong this is probably the most enjoyable racing game I have played (being that they are not my thing), but it is still a toy.  This reminds me of the electronic slot car track toy you had as a kid but instead of pulling a lever and making your car go you flick your car along.  
Will play this anytime it hits the table, but would become boring with more than a couple of plays at a time.

Light, silly game of manual dexterity; I've only played Pitchcar, the re-release, which I've heard is of slightly inferior quality to the original.  It's not something I'd want to play every night, or for an hour straight in one night, but I'd love to play with a large group every week or so.

I expected to have more fun with this one, but any sort of variation in skill levels between players makes this an exercise in embarrassment as the players at the back try to catch up.  I get the feeling I haven't played with the correct group yet - you need some friends who are willing to have fun yet still play competitively.  

Update - the family loves it for big gatherings.  The key for this game is to place dimes underneath the forward edge of the pieces so that the cars move smooth like butta. I almost want the expansions now. . .

This a fun, if expensive, little game that is good for virtually any age. It can be a kid's game, a party game, or a dexterity filler for more serious game nights. I anticipate playing this a ton over the years. The one downside: the tracks that come with the base game are rather basic and dull. You need the (pricey) expansions to realize the potential here. Also, some of the railings don't stay put.

RATING: 8
Fun to play but set up and teardown are really annoying. It also requires a very large table (hence pitchcar mini exists). Really should come with a ramp or two in the base box, but this game has more expensive components than basically anything else so I guess I can give it a pass. Great drinking game or to have out during a football game or something. You should know if you would like the game before you buy it as it's that straightforward.

Great fun, but from my perspective, it doesn't differ that much from Pitchcar Mini (which I have).  I think I could play either interchangeably and be happy either way.  I guess if I could choose, I would play the larger version.  But from a practical perspective, I don't really have the table space to get any play out of the full size version.

Update: I do have the table space, and I have to increase the rating from 7 to 8 as my children really enjoy the game, my son especially.  While he can't really flick yet, it's still a lot of fun to see the joy in their faces as they play the game.

Pretty fun game. With everyone fumbling around it can feel kinda weird, creating highs and lows based... well, based on (un)lucky shots mostly.

The Good: One of the most enjoyable aspects of a manual dexterity game is making a high excitement, high tension shot. And this game has loads of them ! High replayability because the track can be changed. The components are great. This one really draws a crowd, and pretty much everyone likes it. 

The Bad: The tracks do not lay perfectly flat. As a result, there are ridges where the tracks join together. At first, we just made that a part of the game - you had to remember where the bad spots were. Then I started adding miniature playing cards under sections of the track to level things. This is much more fun, with some amazing long shots.

5歳の息子が夢中になって遊びます。ただ、付き合う大人は少々苦痛。このゲームの欠点は、広げるスペースが必要であること、ひざが痛くなること、ガードレールがすぐに外れることです。ルールを守ることをこのゲームで息子は学習しました。なお、男の子ならば、拡張１はどうせ欲しくなるので一緒に買った方がいいです。
カラバンテとピッチカーミニとは互換性ないようですのでご注意です。後、他の安い類似製品もありますが、耐久性の面から高くてもピッチカーを強くお勧めします。
それほど奥のあるゲームではありません。奥深さを望んでいるならキャロムの方がお勧めです。

I enjoy this game, but find it very frustrating.  The seams between track sections can make the tokens skip.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The rules: On your turn, flick your car. Try to be first around the track 3 times. 

There’s not much more than that yet it’s quite enjoyable for all ages. It’s a great game for getting people involved. The interactive nature tends to draw in onlookers and it’s so easy to understand that those onlookers almost always end up wanting to play. 

If you like the game it’s definitely worth picking up the first extension as well. The additions of the ramps, the tunnel, and the cross-over tracks really allow for some fun tracks that you just can‘t build with the base game.

One of our family favorite dexterity games that can be played with big groups. Of course a lot of space and some setup time is required, but an enjoyable fun time always occurs during each play. We typically only do one or two laps, but with younger kids, this is plenty for the good times to roll.

PitchCar has a big problem. The track pieces don't connect very well and just one uneven connection can ruin a whole game as they send unfortunate player's disc flying. Fortunately this can be fixed by adding a bit of blue tack under the track pieces. The fix makes setting up the game take longer than it should, but it's worth it in the end: with the fix PitchCar is a lot of fun and a great combination of tactics and accurate flicking, where (with experienced players) luck plays no role - the most skillful player will win.

A good looking racing game where dexerity and luck is needed. Looks better than actually is - unfortunately. Junctions brings quite a lot luck elements: sometimes your flick goes like you wanted, but every now and then your "formula" jumps from the junction and it flies out of the track. Aargh! Still probably the second best dexterity game ever (after Crocinole)?

Dexterity + racing: fun combination. And now I found out the perfect solution for my 5-year-old kid's disadvantage. First we played by the rules - we won too easily, he wasn't that engaged. For the second time we played in a way that we had one move, he had two. He won too easily - he was quite engaged but it just wasn't right: he finished 3 laps when I was just over 2 laps. So now, the perfect solution: a die with 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 faces. He rolls the die in the beginning of his turn and has as many moves as rolled. It even added some dice-rolling fun to the mix. Now it's a winner at home!

This is an enjoyable flicking dexterity racing game that has a ton of expansions to bring in other elements. I thought the mini version was just fine until I played the larger version and found it a better experience overall - but I'm not certain I can put my finger on why it is better in the larger version.

Pitchcar scratches a couple of itches for me that add up to be more than the sum of the parts.

I used to love slot-car racing as a kid, but I only ever had a single small track plus a couple of extra cars and a couple of extra pieces of track. As much as I loved it, it always lost out to less expensive stuff like Micronauts and GI Joe.

I also love flicking games, especially crokinole, which I played as a kid, but not nearly as much as I would have liked.

Enter Pitchcar, which is a flicking game version of slot car racing. The game comes with 8-10 straightaways and a similar number of curves, which is enough to build a course with some texture to it, but not enough to keep me from wanting the expansions (intersections, overpasses, jumps!) or even a second base set :$

Play is terribly straightforward, and the whole family, from 4 to 90, can play together, and I feel safe in saying the more the merrier, since the pace is usually pretty decent.

The only fly in the ointment is that the track pieces don't always join as smoothly as I'd like, which results in some bumps that can throw or flip your car if you're not careful. Once you understand and accept this, though, I think it can be viewed as another challenge and not a problem.

This is a hair's breadth away from becoming a ten, and I just got it this past Christmas.

Très fun, mais toujours un peu long à mettre en place car il faut régulièrement ajuster la hauteur des pistes (ça se joue à très peu, largement moins qu'un millimètre, mais pour éviter tout saut, il faut régulièrement mettre un ou deux bouts de papier sous les pistes pour les mettre au même niveau que les autres - et ça, c'est vraiment laborieux).

I like this game with the right group.  I think when I get the family together this summer we will have to set it up a flick some disks around for a while.

I'd have more fun with it if I could get the joins in the track pieces to align smoothly (despite playing on a completely flat table). The minutest discrepancy in height between pieces will send your car careering off, which is very frustrating considering the game demands precision and restraint from the one doing the flicking. I'm tempted to sell this and buy something like Catacombs which would perhaps satisfy my disk flicking needs more.

A game for a totaly fun experience. It is a dexterity game with a bit of tactics and some basic strategy involved. 
It is quickly played and perfect filler or ending of a game night. Especially so if other games were heavy and/or brain burning. 
I think it is  very relieving to play a game were finger flipping is the main skill and the outcome of the game is never settled till the first game crosses the goal line since there is allways (and will be) a good posiblity for failure in flipping, and this only increases the joy of the game.

PitchCar is loads of fun for the entire family, for non gamers, for playing with booze, and for large groups. Extensions are definitely required for this to be enjoyed by adults.

Pitchcar is one of the few games that I don't have to sell to non-gamers.  It looks great on the table, the rules are self-evident, and it appeals to the widest possible range of people.  It has a "why didn't I think to invent this" type appeal.  People look at it and know they're going to have fun.  I've played in non-competitive friendly games, cut-throat tournaments, and everything in between.  Pitchcar is a game that lets its players invoke the mood, and that's why it so seldom disappoints.

Playing PitchCar is like being a kid again.

For adults, it's 20-30 minutes of smack talk, swearing, flicking, missing, and making amazing shots. It is an absolute blast to play.

It's also one of those games that, more often than not, makes everyone light up when you open the box. "Wait, you mean we're not playing a board game -- we're flicking little cars? Awesome!"

I had no idea I would enjoy PitchCar as much as I do. There isn't a single thing I'd change about it.

Fun, short and exciting dexterity game which, like most flicking games, is terribly hard on the fingernails. There's a surprising level of skill in learning the best way to make use of the rails and, if you're very clever, some tactical positioning to block the track for those behind. Rails popping out is an overstated problem (it happens, but is not at all annoying) and it should fit on most dining tables.

A second copy allows bigger tracks. We can also have racing teams!

Seriously, I bought this because we had another blast at New Year, and our friends brought their kids who could compete on equal terms. The Nintendo DSs went away for a few hours, but we all wanted bigger tracks and using the extension (see comments elsewhere about the difficulty of this expansion) just made things too difficult for the youngest. I thought about extension 2, but there was an offer on the full set and I got it for not much more than extension 2. Bonus! More track, more cars, more fun.

Not that we don't like dexterity games or flicking, but this falls flat for some reasons. It has every quality that guarantees success like high quality, modularity, adjustable difficulty, yet it's mildly entertaining at best. I guess we've been spoiled by [thing=32129][/thing].

Fun classic. Perhaps the purest use of flicking mechanics in any dexterity game. For such a family-oriented game the rules and mechanics ties in exeplarly with the theme! A little gem, but with very short ifetime at a given session - one or two matches is enough.

Really good looking dexterity race game. Feels like a tabletop version crossover between midgetgolf & bowling. 

It's the kinda game that get's everyone enthusiastically howling, so it's fun at parties at well... Good for creating a great enthusiastic atmosfear. Results go down with beer, but the fun doesn't.

NL: Mooi uitgevoerd houten racespel waarbij je de "racewagens" met je vingers door de baan schiet. Oppassen dat je niet te hard schiet (vlieg je uit de baan of over de vangrail), maar wel hard genoeg om de rest voor te komen en te blijven.

Goed voor ontzettend dikke pret. Sjoelen voor deze eeuw.

Fantastic components, super easy to introduce new players, and just fun and silly overall.  This is a great game to set up when some friends are over just standing around since everyone immediately gets interested and wants to jump in.  Games are quick and the variable setup allows for new challenges every game.  Plays best on a hard, perfectly flat surface since any slight variation can cause ridges between tracks which isn't fun to deal with.  No expansions yet, but it would be fun to try some out.

Game in a Nutshell: Take turns flicking your car (disc) around the track. He who can pass, nail the straight-aways, and bank around the corners best, all while staying on the track, wins.

Played as: 2,3,4,6,7,8 player

Played with: Plain; Extension #1.

Pros: Fast and fun. Practically the definition of accessible. Just set it up on a table in everyone's sight and the game can't help but get played. With play alternating like it does, the back and forth passing adds plenty of trickiness and excitement. People never feel dumb or stupid for losing, and all players can walk away feeling good.

Cons: It's a bit pricey. The rails don't seem to want to stay in place and I wonder if the cars couldn't have been a tiny bit heavier to avoid flying off the track as regularly. The base game won't cut it on its own after you've played with one of the extensions.

Other: By no means is this a 'strategy' game, so let's just get it out of the way and say it's all about having a good time around the table. Complaints aside, this is the easiest game I've every been able to get played. I like it more with the greater amount of players but still retains plenty of fun with less. The best advice I received was using playing cards as shims to smooth out any small 'lips' in the track.

Best Use: Leaving it set up on a dedicated table where the family or friends can jump in for a quick race.

This "game" is a hard time storing, if you don't want to squeeze in the red borders every time, and you don't, trust me.

If you are three or more it could be fun, but you need a big table. You don't want to build this on the floor unless you have it very clean and you are all very bendable. You need to move around the track, and on a floor you need to kneel, get up, stumble on the track, bump into another person, sit down, get up - you get it.

Otherwise than that it is family friendly and party friendly. Easy and clear rules. And not extremely easy. The extensions make it more fun with crossings.

Was pretty fun for a few plays, but at $100 with the expansion, I decided it wasn't worth the price. Each turn you pretty much just flick it as hard as you can...there isn't much skill involved or "good shots" really. The harder you can flick it the better you do. It's kind of like seeing who can spit the farthest. Probably better with the jump, where I'm sure flicking it hard would be a bad idea...but I doubt it would be that much better. Also, it wasn't flat so for each piece I had to put something underneath to prop it up so the pucks would slide from piece to piece without geting stuck.  Not very good quality, especially for the price! SOLD

Players flick disks along a track in a "race" to the finish line.  I say "race" becuase in my first (and so far only) game, everyone got backed up at a jump, and half the game was spent just trying to get at least one person over the jump.  This reminded me of crocinole, but with the added annoyance of being able to go off the track, as well as the ability to have huge backups that are tedious and tiresome.

This went over so well that we set it up during a holiday party with family and it was a smash hit again,

Aside from the fact that I'm horrible at it. (Who wants to play SMART anyway, when you have a 1-in-a-hundred chance of making the greatest shot in Pitchcar history?), the game really does shine in larger groups.

I am seldom going to suggest a dexterity game, but a lot of the time I'll play one if that's what people are playing.

What a fun game!  

It's difficult to describe this game in a way that makes it sound fun to others.  You flick little wooden disks around a track...  and it's guaranteed to have you shouting with joy or frustration.  There's lots of laughs when you flick your car across the room.

I think the expansion is essential, because it includes ramps and some narrow parts of track that are technically challenging.  

This serves to limit the run away leader problem as they can get stuck at the hard parts, allowing others to catch up.  Plus it's fun to launch your pieces through the air off a ramp.

A great game for when you just want a change of pace from playing with cubes. This is a really good game for a mix of gamers... from the youngest to the oldest. It's a simple game yet not without an element of skill involved as you really do need to be able to control your flicks reasonably well to avoid sending your car flying off the track. 

The expansions do add some good variety to the tracks you can build but the key I think is not getting too complicated... keep the courses varied enough to be interesting but don't produce too many choke points on the track so that everyone is constantly all balled up on top each other.

Carabande or PitchCar or PitchCar Mini; basically the same dexterity game and a really fine one, generally putting adults and children on par. The reason why I'm not interested in it is that the narrowness of the tracks doesn't really allow for devising other game modes than racing, where you usually have fewer than 3 viable shot options; not a lot compared to Carom or Crokinole. Also since opponents are the only obstacle, it's harder to catch up the more behind you are while the first player has all the space for themselves. Then even provided you're more interested than I am, the amount of money you'll sink on expansions to build an interesting track could be spent on a cheap snooker table instead.

There are two main problems with this game. One is the amount of space you need to play it, the other is joins between track pieces. Still, a fun game and I think it's best with as many players as possible in the mix.

(Carabande) A blast for a group, I wish I had the expansion, but am not going to pay $200+ or whatever ridiculous price it goes for these days.  Needs a lot of room, but worth it; I dont think I have ever placed higher than third, however.

Played only once so far.  The game is fun, with plenty of hooting and jeering from the crowd!  I think it would probably only play really well with a large group, as it helps te have plenty of enthusiastic onlookers for each shot.   It seems a lot more chaotic and with fewer opportunities for skilled play than crokinole.  Given a choice between these two, I prefer the latter.

Fun car flicking game.  Considered a dexterity game you take the tracks and set them up on a level table.  Even the most level of tables you could use some playing cards to even out some of the bumps your car might encounter during the game.  Easy game that will wake up a group after a long strategy game.

I can play this game with my gamer friends, my 6-year-old nephews, and my relatives.  No deep thinking required, no AP, no tabletalk -- just drink your beer and flick, and it doesn't stop being fun.  You can talk about the elegance of whatever auction engine you're in love with until you're blue in the face; this seats eight comfortably, and you can't beat the flick.

With the ramp extension included, this game is "10" with a bullet.

Pitchcar is a really good, fun and addictive dexterity racing game! So simple idea but tons of fun!

This is really a great game for all ages! It seems a great excuse for playing with race cars as an adult...at the least! This is a great party game; set it up somewhere in the house so people have access to playing it if they would like too! We have even found that announcing that there is a grand prize for the race winner or team makes for a great time! It doesn't see a great amount of plays, but I believe it to be a different game from everything else you will own and has its purpose! Partys, family gatherings, game nights, or just a game for two...it's all good!

單純的彈指遊戲
完成漂亮過彎會有爽感
不過基本賽到除非實力差距太大
不然應該速度會差不多
規則:
*將跑道連接好，並固定好紅色護欄
*玩家輪流進行試跑一圈，彈指次數越少的起跑位置將越前面，可改猜拳決定，依照順位將賽車如圖排在起跑點。
*照順序依序用手指頭彈車前進，可用任何一根手指頭彈，但只能接觸一次
>滑出跑道或翻車就放回彈車前的地點並結束這回合
>被撞出跑道外，被撞的車放回原地點，撞人的車放回彈前地點
>被其他車子或護欄擋到，可以平移一個車身的寬度
>彈飛時，一次飛躍2個以下(包含2個)的跑道板塊是被允許的，若超過2個板塊則必須將賽車拿回原位並結束
*先跑完三圈的玩家為此站的冠軍 名次積分如下：1st=10分，2nd=8分，3rd=6分，4th=5分，5th=4分，6th=3分，7th=2分，8th=1分
***變體規則***
>翻車後不需放回原位，但下一回合把車子翻回來不能彈。
>若車子出軌又翻車，不只要將車子放回原位，且玩家將損失下一回合。
>撞人的不回原點，被撞得回被撞點如果翻車則要喪失一回合翻正
***變體賽制***
追逐賽 玩家分兩組 兩邊玩家起始位置要距離8個跑道板塊(半圈)，想辦法超越敵方車子。
>兩人比賽中，誰先追到並超越對方，誰就是贏家。
>多人分組比賽中，被敵方超越的玩家將賽車移出賽道淘汰出局。比賽直至一組的賽車都被移出賽道結束，尚有賽車留在場上的一組獲勝。

I did not like this as much as I thought I would.  I imagine if I got better at it I would be able to take risks along with taking better shots in general.  It plays very fast and was enjoyable.

It can be 20 minutes of fun with a crowd of people. But it is mindless fun designed for kids or the kid in the adult. It's not a game we'll repeat play in a night.

What I like:
- Mechanically simple
- Reminds me of slot racing cars as a kid
- Goes pretty quickly, at least with 3 players

What I don't like:
- It is a dexterity activity, so I would put it in the "party game" category
- Takes as long to set up as it does to play. Then takes that long again to tear it down

It was fun. I would play again. It's just not in the same category as brain-oriented games.

What a great idea for a game. It is a bit pricey for the large version, but always draws a crowd. Simply flick your car around the track and win the race. But the expansions add jumps and some lanes can have no railings so watch out. You can also play the friendly way or unfriendly, where you can knock others off. Lots of fun for all.

RATING: 8
Lots of fun, the pieces needed work to get the rails to stay, and setting up a track requires 'grooming' for the cars to move smoothly. But this game really seems to have universal appeal, and I can't think of any other game we have played that has generated as many laughs as this one.

September 2010: I like dexterity games with some tactics and here we have one. You can block your competitors, push your luck by trying more hazardous pitches if you are falling behind and speculate how your competitors will do in the long run. PitchCar is fun, quick, has easy-to-learn (-teach) rules and can be played by up to 8 players, so it is (almost?) perfect game for a casual gaming night or to play with children.

Carabande: Excellent quality, rates an 8!  PitchCar: I heard horror stories of PitchCar missing some of the rails.  Mine was missing a straight track.  And one of the other straight track pieces has the cut for the rail crooked so the pieces won't line up.  Ferti is telling me to deal with the company I purchased it through, but the game was sealed when I bought it.  I've never had such bad customer service before in this community (Rio Grande and Mayfair have always been willing to send missing pieces ASAP).

I've long enjoyed the mini version and bought the full size version for my nephew since he liked the game so much.

Still a great game though.

(10+ plays)  Great fun!  Works at parties, works with friends, works with the kids.

I have converted this set of the base Pitchcar game, Extension 1 & 2, and The Cross to the amazing Mario PitchKart variant posted on this site.  I made my own version, graphic design, rules and components - grabbing the art and most of the good ideas from everybody else in the files page on this site.  It turned out great!  Not likely to ever play the original version again, and my rating on this game is for the modded variant.

I have been tweaking the rules a bit each play, and have something that is really fun.  I'd say the main revision that has made the game for fun is eliminating the loss of picked up items when you go off the track.  It took the game from never having any items used, to everyone getting a chance to flick a few things around every game.  Worth the compromise on the theme...

(I own two copies of Pitchcar and combine them into one track, playing two laps generally. I successfully glued down the rails and keep all the tracks in a dedicated third-party box.) This game is great for all ages.  The possibilities for track layouts and play variants are endless.  This is simply a GREAT game to have around and a great gift for non-gamers with kids.  It is rated with heavy consideration of the kind of game it is.  If I had to play it more than, say, 2 times in one night, however, it would quickly start to lose its appeal for all (about -2 per game after two) :+).  "Hey guys, lemme show you Taj Mahal now."  ;+)

Fun dexterity game of flicking car pieces around a puzzle-piece track.

The full-size version is less fiddly than the mini version, especially for adults.

WARNING: Car pieces may be different on each side (one is more stable, one with less friction) so it may matter which side you apply the stickers - at least be consistent.

WARNING: Stickers show wear very easily?

WARNING: Joins between track pieces may throw cars off course if played on a carpet & not perfectly flat. Easiest solution is to put long thin shims under the leading edge of each track piece where needed. We keep strips of cardboard in the game box which we cut from the packaging it came in!

Build the wooden track, put on the crash barriers, line up the cars on the starting grid and take turns flicking your car discs around the circuit, using the barriers to negotiate the bends. Try to stay on the track and be first across the line. Quite a hit with my group, the only downside for me being when we can't get the track level and significant steps between some track pieces can prevent smooth running. I think I'll put a few old playing cards in the box for the next session to use them to iron out the step problem.

I bought this when a co-worker offered to buy my Pitchcar Mini for $5 less than I paid for it. :-)   In 2 short two player pursuit games the rails popped out 8-10 times, which almost never happened with the mini version.  
I found the cars to be much more twitchy, but it was easier to get off a nice long shot.

I'm not glad I traded up, but I don't regret it either.

RATING: 8
A fun, sprawling flicking game. It's fun both to watch and play, which is good because there can be some downtime with large groups. I love how both really good and really bad shots are entertaining in different ways. Just building the track together can be fun, as people pick out a track piece or two that looks fun, or debate on how hard to make a jump.

The downsides are that you need a fair amount of space for a big track, and you need someone to keep the game moving along quickly. I printed out cards with the car colors on them, and cycle through the deck as people play and call out whose turn it is, so people don't forget where they are in the turn order. It's also possible for someone to get pretty far behind and stop having fun, though they can still make great shots that make other people cheer, or watch the other people's shots.

Our house rules:
-You can bump someone else's car as long as it doesn't knock them upside down, knock them off the track, or knock them more than one track section away from where they started.
-You can move your car one car-width in any direction before flicking, to get a better shot.
-(not sure on this one)If someone else's car is totally blocking progress (like it's in the tunnel and no one can pass), you can move it temporarily while you take your shot.

Track building notes:
-Start building with the more complicated pieces like the jump/tunnel or the cross. It's much easier to start with these and build around them with corners and straights than vice versa.
-Start out the track with a pretty straight section, to give the cars a chance to spread out some before hitting hard turns or jumps or anything. It's not fun if everyone clogs up at the very beginning.
-Just don't use the straight piece with the curved bottleneck. It slows the race down dramatically and is frustrating.

I used to play flicking bottle cap races in my school days, so I may be nostalgic.
But this is a modern and elegant wooden version with top notch production that is totally worth it.
So simple and so much fun. Amazing for kids.
Even building the tracks is nice, the problem is picking up the track parts after playing to get them stored again into the box.
It is an action game, but not as crazy as others, so it can fill a spot in party games.
Anyone can flick the wooden tokens so anyone can play and have fun right from the very first moment. They may be better or worse at it, but it's surely one of the few games that almost everybody will like.

As a dexterity game, Carabande is a lot of fun.  The flicking of the discs is clearly a skill that can be improved on over time.

Just picked it up last week and have only played a few times.  Cool game for adults and kids.  I'm sure it'll be a hit at Thanksgiving get-togethers, etc.  Playing cards have helped even out the track so that the cars don't jump off the track so much.  I'm waiting to buy to expansion b/c I want to make sure that we play it enough to warrent another $50.

Update (Feb.'09): This is a good game, but not many folks want to play it.  If I had friends that were fans, then I'd probably buy the new Formula D game.

rating after 2 plays (both 8pl) - 6/7

not sure its at its best with 8pl cos track too crowded but good fun

notes - track must be pan flat else u get lips which send the cars off the track - NB this might actually not be a bad thing if u know where they are cos adds some strategy and skill too avoid them BUT with 8pl not enuff room. we may have played with rules incorrect but we kept in initial turn order which felt wrong compared with leader goes 1st. also if u know another car off u must go back to where u were which is ok but if ur goind after that player and they 'respawn' in front of u cos they messed up is v harsh on you

so with 8 players and a few beers is good fun but not a great 'game'

Overall, a fun dexterity racing game. The Audi Rennspiel-Aktion version of the game probably has the best quality components, but is pretty expensive. The Pitch Car edition has some new pieces, but the quality is probably the lowest. Rails pop out of the Pitch Car version all the time. Also, note that Pitch Car and Carabande are *not* compatible - the track is thinner and the joins are shaped differently on Pitch Car.

--05Aug2004-- Loads of fun...  The children (9, 4 & 2) love it.  The track 'walls' tend to fall out a bit more than I'd prefer - and I'm not at all confident that things would fit back in the box if I glued them in; I'll get there eventually.
--Feb2006-- Current favourite of son #2 (age 3).  He loves "The Flicking Car Game" and practices it while his siblings are at school.

I think I should like this a lot more than I did after my fist and only play.  It was a 10 player massive tracked nightmare at BGG.Con '07, and I played horribly, so maybe that is part of the reason I wasn't into it much.  It's flicking, and I love Crokinole, so I won't stick this one with a 5 rating until I play it more.

A fun finger-flicking fest.  For someone with typically-above-average eye-hand coordination, I was embarrassingly bad at this the one time I played.  I desire a second play, both because I had a good time, and because I crave redemption.

I have two base sets and the cross extension. I would like to trade this all together.  the tracks are in good condition, there is one chipped piece and one piece that is pretty warped.  all the rest are pretty good. 

The boxes are terrible. I have two boxes and because of the weight of this game,  the boxes get abused. the cross did not come in a box, more of a plastic bag, and I have the original packaging. Also, The cars from both sets are all different colors.

I bought this so I could play it with my 3 year old son, tempted by positive reviews on the 'geek. Luckily it turned out to be the game I hoped it would be: tons of fun for old and young alike. So far I have played mostly just with my son. We play the the 'little-boy rule', which stipulates that little boys may have a second try. With that rule in place, my son can offer me quite decent competition. I don't give it a 10 only because the components are good but not perfect. The tracks warp a little bit, which cause unwanted ramps in the track, and the sides don't always stay in the tracks. I will probably also buy Extension 1 someday.
Update: My son is now 4, and I just bought Extension 1. It's still a hit, and this breaths new life in the much-played game. My son now often wants to play with the grown-up rules.

I have the original version from 20 years ago. It hasn't had 20 years of play, I'll tell you that much--I've always had a hard time finding players for this. I suppose the learning curve means some will suck and some will crush it, and there's no mitigating that, really. We play the rockus French rules, where if you knock someone off of the track you get to take their place.

My Crokinole skills come in handy here. Too handy, often, as I want for competitors.

Dexterity game for up to 8 players where you simply flick your disc-shaped car around a track. Much more fun than it sounds, because you laugh at the mishaps of others, and cheer and whoop when you (or even others) make a great shot. Component issues let this one down. The tracks don't always stay even on the table, leaving "potholes" which fling your car into the air. And the discs are not consistently manufactured; some are smoother than others, meaning some players get an unfair advantage.

I bought this on a whim. It reminded me of the reaces we had with toy cars when we were kids (proper races, mind you - you were pushing you car and it moved on its own). Yet somehow I never got enthusiastic about it. 

Then I started gaming with kids. Game really gets better if there's at least 6 people playing and we always play with the "nasty" rules - it's more fun. 

EDIT: It's a game I don't play often, it's best suited for special, nongamer situation. And it's wonderful in these. At least 6 people is a must.

I was surprised I liked PitchCar this much. It's just fun (great fun). The game is quick, light and exiting.  Always good to have these kind of games around.

The rails pop easily out and the track joints could be smoother as the discs (cars) sometimes catch on them vey annoyingly.

Assuming you have at least 4 people in the game, PitchCar is great. You take turns "pitching" (flicking) little wooden disks around a modular race track, trying to be the first to the finish line. The game is very amenable to house rules, is a crowd pleaser, and just generally a lot of fun. Frankly, I'm surprised this isn't carried by Target and similar stores, as well as toy stores everywhere. I can't think of many games which have such wide appeal.

This game is pretty much exactly what it looks like it is.  Trying to give a good summation is silly.  If it looks like you will like this kind of game, you probably will, if not you probably won't.  I happen to dig it.  The set up time and breakdown time is a little inhibitive, but well worth it.  While they are different in many regards, I find that I can't help but compare this to Formula De.  I always would rather play this.

When giving this a go I find that the more people you have playing the better the experience is.  Many exciting moments here.

Try this:
1. Join a Nascar fantasy league.
2. During each race, set up Carabande in front of the T.V.
3. As the real race runs in the background, have your own race. Three laps seems to be right.
4. Record the order of finish and keep records throughout the year.
5. You can play it solo or let your kids join in at any time.

It adds fun to both Nascar and Carabande. Oh, the winner this year was... Pink!

I love this game so much; I suck SO hard. My aim is deadly accurate, but I always underestimate how hard I'm pitching the cars and wind up magic-missiling them all over the room.

The only trouble I have bringing this to the table is that the table normally isn't big enough (though this isn't necessarily a criticism of the game itself.) Some day, I will buy a table specifically for this purpose, massive enough to build a PitchCar track with all of the extensions (I have #2 currently), and I'll just leave it set up all the time. Some day...

RATING: 7
I'm terrible at dexterity games and this is no exception, but damn, if it isn't fun.

In this game a track, much like the old hot wheels tracks, is built and players take turns flicking disks representing cars around the track trying to be first to complete a set number of laps.  Super simple.

I get a lot of hate when I say this about games but I think this is yet another case of a toy disguised as a game.  That's not an insult or criticism but this is more fun to play WITH than play.  The comment was even made before my last play of this that building the track is half the fun.  Players rarely seem concerned with finishing first but rather enjoy trying to make crazy shots.

I did enjoy this, it's never something I would want to invest money in because you need a lot of the expansion pieces to make truly exciting tracks, but I would never be disappointed in playing.

You flick wooden pieces (the cars) around a race track you construct with the road pieces. This may sound wierd or plain but its REALLY REALLY fun. Some people get amazing bankshots, some keep flicking it off the track and on the floor, others yet flick their car into somebody elses in front of them to have theirs stop and the other persons go flying ahead. This is a really fun and simple game that only gets more hectic the more people you have play. Great great family game.

RATING: 9.5
This dexterity race game brings all to the game table, including my mother-in-law who claims to hate games. I win my fair share of games, but other times I seem to lose all ability flick anywhere but onto the floor. Like a wire gets shorted between my brain and my hand. Regardless, I'm proud to own the PitchCar microbadge and will play at the drop of a hat. I've picked up two expansion sets in addition to my base set and I think I'm good for a while. Most of our layouts leave some pieces left over. Longer tracks can be fun once in a while, but they also can drag on. A nice short track, with 2 or 3 laps for the win is better most of the time. Jumps are both super cool and terribly frustrating. I'm think I may need to implement a house rule about three failed jumps places you at the next piece just to get people moving. If I had any skill with tools, I might consider making some custom track pieces, but instead I'll drool over the pics here on the geek.

Rating is for both Carabande and PitchCar, which is 99% the same game. The differences are in the expansions. This is my favourite dexterity game, although I suck at it like a hoover. Always a hoot to play. With the men, that is. Most women I know are not as fond of it. I own both expensions and the long straight pieces, which provides plenty of variable tracks. Tracks shouldn't be too long, though, as this will be quite painful for the less adept (such as me).

I finally got me a dexterity game, and it's a good one!  Not only that, but it's not nearly as expensive as a Crokinole board.  And not since "Cleopatra and the Society of Architects" have I got so much physical game in such an extraordinarily small box.  This game takes mere seconds to learn, but is pure fun.  I'd like to give it top marks for the lovely, all-wood design, but I have to deduct a bit for the slight warpage of some of the track sections, which has the exceedingly frustrating effect of causing cars to fly off the track when they pass over the meeting points of those sections (and of course I HAD to put the start/finish line on the most warped piece), as well as for the tendency of the rails to pop off when they are hit with a hard shot.  I've discovered that the former problem can be resolved if (a lot of) time is taken during set-up to shim the uneven sections (and it's well worth taking this time - otherwise no power shots!), and I now keep a deck of cards in my PithCar box for this very purpose.  The latter problem can be solved by gluing the rails in place, and I bought some epoxy for that purpose, but I'm hesitant about the amount of storage space the game will then occupy.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

This dexterity game is different from any other game I have played.  The toy factor really contributes to the fun as you flick the little cars around the track that you can construct any way you wish.  A very light game, but perfect as an opener or end game that gets everybody out of their chairs hovering around a table, talking, and laughing as cars hit each other and go flying off the track.  For what it is, a great game.

RATING: 7
[Pitchcar 2003 edition (both side coated)] {Racing; action, variable-player-order} Suitable for all kinds of players; esp. for a mixed group of people. Pitchcar is both exciting and interesting. It's funny to look at player flying their car out of the tracks or through many tiles in a single tick.

The atmosphere changes with different number of players. The cars won't block each other easily in few players' game. However, the cars will usually block each other in 6-8p game, the leader(s) will usually be pushed further away by the followers.

Our game group has several copies of the basic and expansion sets. We can build a large track in our house. :laugh:

[Newer edition] I just noticed that the new edition is single-side coated, similar to the new expansion.  Though it is useless to have double side coated, the old edition looks more elegant.

This was a gift from my wife. Thanks Jeannie!

I'm a big fan of Crokinole. So PitchCar is a natural fit. It's fun to play a game that makes the players get up and walk around the table. 

I need to work on making the seams less of a potential driving hazard. The more predictable the boardplay is the more the players can make skilled shots rather than lucky shots. Being able to predict the boardplay would add more depth to the game.

My only other issue with this game is BGG itself. With all of the expanded and pimped out PitchCar sets in the photo gallery, it's a bit of a let down to open up the base set. And it really shouldn't be. It's unfair to the game to judge it on the biggest layouts.

I bought this planning on many games with the kids.  However their interest seemed to be mild at best and storage (IMHO) is a nightmare.  The rails don't stay in the tracks well and are always coming off while playing.  Yes I could glue them down, but then storage is much larger.

I eagerly awaited my copy of PitchCar, only to find that...there were no cars in the box!  Ferti says they will send the cars.  Until then, well, the game is stuck in neutral :)

Update - Ferti, true to their word, sent me the cars, and brought it to the game group - it was a hit.  We quickly ditched the "only two spaces forward" rule, and played it such that as long as the car landed on the track, right-side-up, all was fair.  And so we decreed, and it was good.  Very good.

Such a classic, straight forward dexterity game.  You make a track with some fairly short walls and each player gets a car, represented by a disk.  Then you take turns flicking the disk and trying to knock everyone else off the track.

I dug this as such a simple, quick, entertaining dexterity game.  Anyone can play and you are bound to have a good time.  It also helped my enjoyment that I made the shot of a lifetime.  One guy was in the lead the whole game and on his last turn he stopped about a half inch from the finish line.  I was half a track away and took a crazy shot, went off the track, jumped over a wall, and rolled down the home stretch, coming to a stop about 1/4 inch past the finish line.  Everyone went nuts, and I will never forget it.

I'm pretty sure this is my new #1 dexterity game.  Although I do really like [thing=102548][/thing].

PitchCar 2nd edition with the 1st expansion. The first game I bought after first discovering BGG in 2005. This game is very fun for kids and adults alike. Plays very well for 2-6 players. More than that causes a little too much down time, but, if everybody is drinking, that is not much of an issue. The expansion definitely adds to the enjoyment of the game and adds more variety.

PitchCar lets you bring the excitement of Putt-Putt to your dining room table!  Actually, that's not a bad analogy, because both are dexterity games that are instantly understood by new players.  The flicking is tricky enough that the experiencd players aren't guaranteed a win.  PitchCar is the spectacle game that welcomes new players with open arms.

There is not a better game to pull out whenever with a bunch of guys, gamers or not.  Cheaper than a pool table, ping pong table, current video game console (or game for that matter), and more portable by miles than any of those options.  And it provides just as much laughter and enjoyment as those options.  Ought to be in every gamer's collection.  Fits the definition of a "10" for me on the 'Geek's rating scale--I always want to play, and fully expect that to remain unchanged.

UPDATE:  I feel compelled to downgrade PitchCar for one reason:  set up.  Seems silly, but that does keep me from playing it any and every time.

Pitchcar, one of the few games in my collection that new players can grasp the essentials of playing by merely looking at the board and pieces.  Of course, a bit of explanation is still needed, but Pitchcar is fun and fast and has great components.  One of the better matches of rules and theme I've seen.  If you are looking for something that can be played in 15-20 minutes and can support up to 6-8 players (or more if you make your own pieces), Pitchcar is your game.

The hours fly by with this game. Beware! You'll want expansions on expansions--and they're not cheap! Great fun for all ages. I've come to enjoy it most at large parties. I can set it up and have it out for people to just go up and start playing without a full description that goes something like this: "Flick your disc around the track three times and you win. If your disc flies off the track put him back where you flicked him from."

That description alone delivers hours of fun for large groups.

Better than other dexterity games, because you don't really have to explain any rules to get started.  Just set this up on a table at a party, and someone is going to walk up and want to play.  It's indestructable for the most part, so you don't have to worry about food and drink around it; it's not at all intimidating, so your non-gamer friends won't shy away; and it's totally fun to flick your car around the track.  I've heard that it's even more fun with the expansion.

UPDATE: Hasn't seen the table much.  I think it might just need the right crowd and conditions (read beer and pretzels).

It's indestructable for the most part, so you don't have to worry about food and drink around it; it's not at all intimidating, so your non-gamer friends won't shy away; and it's totally fun to flick your car around the track.  I've heard that it's even more fun with the expansion.

RATING: 8
I almost always have fun with dexterity games and this is no exception.  Although it is possible to create a track that wrecks the game a bit by creating too much of a bottle neck, that is easily avoided with a bit more experience -- and more experienced players tend to be able to handle more brutal tracks anyway.

I would need to try this out with a lot of players to really get a feel for it. Though the most annoying part of the game is how poorly the guardrails attach and stay in place. That is rather disappointing.

Sweetness.  Pure pure sweetness.  Such a beautiful change of pace.  My fingers curl up in anticipation just thinking about the game.  This game is the swiss army knife of games.  Its useful in all situations and groups, but its never the perfect tool.  

Its a good practice game for crokinole.  Or a nice change of pace.  Good times.

RATING: 7
PitchCar is fun, but it pales in comparison to Crokinole.  Both are flicking dexterity games, but Crokinole has so much more depth and strategy in addition to the simple dexterity elements.  PitchCar has a couple distinct advantages over Crokinole because it can be played with more than 4 players, so it's a good dexterity game for big groups of 5 to 8 players.  PitchCar also has the nice advantage of being able to build variable tracks, especially if you use any of the expansions.  However, it's so large that you won't be able to play it on many tables, which is definitely a downside, plus it takes a while to setup and put away.  But more important than either of those two downsides is the fact that it doesn't have the same depth of strategic decision-making that Crokinole offers.

I have Pitchcar, plus the extension. In principle, I love the game. In practice, I think I need to find a suitable table for it. The constant shuffling from one side of the track to the other (when played on the floor or a too-large table) strips some of the fun. 

That said, my 5 year old loves loves loves this game and is very good at it. I think my 7 year old feels as I do, and my husband has no interest at all in this one.

This game is fun and frustrating.  I love how it gets the group up and moving around the table.  Watching your car wipe out in the same spot 3 or 4 times in a row can make anybody mad.  I really like just taking whatever pieces are available and making a track on the fly.

As for a finger-flicker, I definitely like crokinole better, but Pitchcar has its purpose in a multi-player arena.  The "mini" edition is too small for my fingers. Interested in trying the new BiSikle.

RATING: 7
This game is so fun. The way you actually race cars by pitching them. It's really cool. Your fingers can hurt after the races sometimes. Using the raling also helps you alot on the sharp turns. Otherwise your dead meat. All of the poeple we play with at this loves it. Not one person hated it. It is really hard not flicking too hard or too soft. It is also reall difficult riding on the rails. Nearly impossible with no railings. The game is really long if no railings are on. I suggest putting as many railings as possible for your first game and take some off after you get the hang of the game and your strategy on how you flick the car.

Excellent parts. A funny game combines luck and hidden skills and casual strategies. Fit house parties. Hilarious as players keep shifting around the table to locate best likely drifting moves. Prefer original rules than the variant which allows hitting opponent's car off track. The variant just adds chaos and divert from the racing goal, though I believe certain people in the world would love this variant. I just don't appreciate turning a racing game into a mindless shooting game.

I saw this game for the first time at DragonCon a few years back.  I watched them play for a few minutes, and kept on going.  I wasn't really into games at the time, but the game seemed so simple, pure, and fun.  It has managed to burn a hole in my head ever since and I have regretted not hanging around and asking to join them.  Now, I'm into board games, so I go to Origins 04, and finally get a chance to play.  I loved it, and my friends did too.

Ez a játék véleményem szerint hiánypótló a maga nemében - úgy ügyességi (dexterity), hogy közben azok is egyformán élvezik, akik nem olyan magabiztosak ebben a műfajban.

Egyenes és kanyar darabokból, magunk által összerakott pályán, könnyű fából készült zsetonokat pöckölgetve versenyzünk... és nagyjából ennyi. A komponensek minőségiek, el tudom hinni, hogy vigyázva a készletre 10, vagy akár 15 év múlva is ugyanilyen jól szolgálnak majd. A játék megengedő abban, hogy ha gyerekekkel vagy kevésbé gyakorlottakkal játszunk, gumi oldalfalakat rakhatunk egyes szakaszokra, így gátolva a pályáról való lecsúszást (illetve azon mandinert véve egy pöckölésből fél kört haladva!).

Rated after 5 "games" (where a game means a tournament of several tracks or a season of several tracks). There definitely is a place for this kind of games, I really like it.

There's something primal about flicking imaginary cars around a track.  It probably recalls the days of building Hot Wheels courses in the garage, only this time you actually get to compete against other people!  It's ridiculously expensive, but probably worth selling about 4-5 mediocre games from your collection to get the funds together to purchase the entire set.  Why NASCAR hasn't picked this up for licensing it is beyond me.

Mine's actually Carabande. It's a great game, especially for non-gamers (it's a race game with no rules, other than take it in turns), or when you've got down time between heavier games.

I like it, but oh, the packaging is a pain. Once the side rails are inserted, the track won't go back into the box (and I don't want to take the rails out for risk of damaging the track).

RATING: 7
The best filler game I know of. Perfect for throwing together a quickie while waiting for everyone to show up, and easily explained in less than thirty seconds. Also fun to give newbies the chance to build up the track and see what comes out.

Played a few times (with 4 to 8 players). A decent dexterity game - and not one I am good at, if there ever was one. Still, it is fun once in a while, and the luck of physics will occasionally allow someone else than the best player to win.

I picked Pitch Car up looking for something quick and fun and maybe something that could be played with some of my teenager clients.  The first game I played of it I had a blast, I cant count how many times my car went flying off the track but I didn't care I was having fun.  I'm bring this over to my sisters later for my nephews to try.

Excellent party game. Quick, easy to learn, accessible to non-gamers, and loads of fun. My only minor complaints are sometimes the rails can be a bit soft, and the joints can be a bit treacherous. (But maybe those are "features" rather than "bugs.") House rule: The player in last place gets +1 flip. Also, the game is also good for kids; I give kids a +1 "kid flip." (So a kid in last place gets 3 flips!) These keep the game a little more even and exciting, even with my 4-year-old daughter!

A great change of pace.  I've found that if you hammer the rails in (I just used the heel of my hand and a t-shirt as a cushion), they will stay put.  Played a 5 player game last week and not a single rail popped out.

Carabande edition:

A neat mix of the dexterity and the racing genre (unfortunately I'm not a fan of either).  This is a great game for all ages and all types of people.  Scales exceptionally well with the more participants the merrier.  The only downside is the need for a large enough space to accommodate the tracks as well as a really even surface so no one section is slightly above another, which would cause an undue amount of headaches.

Finally got the game for Christmas and have had a blast playing with people from 5 to 55 years old.

Great party game.

I'm not too keen on the low rails which spring out at every opportunity, nor the badly aligned stepped edges in-between track sections, which make the cars either stop dead in their tracks or constantly fly off.

If these issues could be addressed & I could smoothly glide across greater distances in a single shot, my rating would rise considerably. "I wonder if beveled bases would lessen the problem?"

As it stands I think the small, stunted, movement shunts are an issue that players will always have to put up with.

Love the game altough it's sometimes a bit frustrating that the good players (say "me") win against a newbiew all the time. The game requieres quite some practicing before you master the basic shots. When all are roughly at the same level it's a great game - also great for introducing new gamers to the hobby if you don't play too competitious...

Update:  I got tired of Pitchcar because microscopic variations in track heights at joints often caused my "car" to fly 1,000,000 miles off of the track on account of my particularly aggressive flicking style.  Tumbling Dice now seems to take care of most of my flicking-gaming needs.

-----

I can't really rate this game because I'm not sure that it even really qualifies as one.  I mean, why aren't those electric racing tracks with the finger trigger controls that were popular in the late '80s considered games?  Why isn't competitive RC car playing considered a game?  Why isn't running the hurdles a game?  I don't know.  These questions befuddle us all.  I enjoy Pitchcar though.

Very Heavy game... almost unplayable given the time it takes to play an entire campaign. Highly recommend a PC game call War in the Pacific Admirals Edition. Basically the same as the board game but much more playable.

The ETO system ported over to the Pacific Theater much better than the A3R system did.
Quite a brain-burner as the Japanese player to achieve historical results by mid-42.

Not quite as good as the WWII:ETO game also published by TSR, this is none the less a decent game, though be prepared to spend a lot of time to play it to completion, especially if you start with the early war in China.

We tried linking the two together a couple of times but that was definitely more trouble than it was worth -- there is actually very little interaction between the two parts.

A relatively manageable corps-level WWII grand strategy game. The naval component of this game make it more complex that it's European sibling (both in regards to mechanics and strategy).

March 3, 2012 - Just got it. I've wanted this one for a long time. Big, but it doesn't look too complex. I plan to link it with European Theater of Operations for a global game.

I owned this a long time ago, sold it, reacquired it, then sold it again.

It looked interesting enough, with more of a bent towards the operational aspect than [i]World in Flames[/i]. But, it was never getting to the table, so I sold it.

Not quite as brilliant as the companion ETO, but shares most of the clean mechanics and tension.  Suffers from the "mega-fleet" problem common to most PTO games.  Nonetheless, an extremely good, absorbing game, especially when played alongside ETO.

Good ands not overly complex treatment of Pacific Theater. I like the map, a little less the counters, but they are functional. Some interesting rules (I like the need to plan a little in advance for  offensives and the associatet cost, plus the fact that if you push too far early in a season you will exhaust your offensive reserve thus being forced to play more conservatively).

Combining PTO with the European Theatre of Operations (ETO) for a "Global War" game of WW2, the system fails as a global conflict simulation because of botched, unclear rules in linking the two games.  However, considered as a separate war game, PTO is fairly interesting and enjoyable in its own right.  The game components are beautiful with colorful maps and glossy units counters.  As a Pacific War game it plays well.  Worth a wink and a nudge, say no more!

A very good game that's not too complicated to learn or play. It's nice that there are rules for linking with the ETO version though I have never had the chance to try it. However, there were only two downsides for me. First, the counters are ugly. Second, I wish there were more optional units to experiment with. It keeps the game on a very historical track, IMHO.

Generally play in combination with ETO, Will choose ETO over PTO simily to concentrate more on land battles. Good smaller scenarios though.

Strategic division level game of WWII in the Pacific. The game focuses on naval and air operations, land combat isn't very intricate except for the War in China. Rules are moderately complex, manageable for an experienced gamer. The maps look very good, the counters are okay, nothing special. Turns are seasonal and include detailed production rules. Covers the entire length of WWII and more, at a decent level of detail and playability. Can be linked with WWII: ETO for a four map monster. I actually did play a linked game once, solo even; it was a lot of fun for about two months.

A solid strategic WWII game; If the chance arose I'd play it again, Sam.   

Best game of this was when my friends and I set it up along with the ETO map on a ping-pong table and played for an entire weekend non-stop, ordering in pizza along the way.  I saw hexagonal grids in my dreams for days afterwards.

Like its sister game ETO it is really long.
I can only remember having played one campaign game starting in 1937 with the Japanese-Chineses conflict on the continent - we never made it to Pearl Harbour.

Once the US gets their 4 quality fighters there is nothing the Japanese can do to prevent a US victory; as early as 1944

RATING: 8
A few weirdnesses (e.g. the "jungle mountain" border between India and Burma means the Japanese will always be out of supply if they try to invade India) but otherwise a decent game and a good companion to SPI's WWII:ETO. If you like the naval system in this game, it inspired the naval system in my own WWII strategic game Absolute Victory. Using the counter tray covers as "boxes" to store the off-map fleet units was sheer genius -- it had accompanying stickers to designate them as such.

WWII ETO is one of my favorite games. Because of that I was very excited about having a Pacific version of the system. Unfortunately, I find the naval war to be strategically broken.  The Japanese player simply creates one big flotilla and hunts the US player's carriers as soon as they leave the west coast. Sure, the US could wait until 1943 when they have a large carrier force, however, that makes actions like Coral Sea unlikely. Other than that, the system works well.  The land war in Asia is fun to play.

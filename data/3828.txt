Heavy and luck-heavy economic game. It's influence on Automobile is quite clear. More elegant in some respects than it's chrome-heavy descendant, but turn order seems to play a greater role.  As this seems to cycle rapidly through the course of the game, control of this at critical times seems to be difficult, adding a significant element of luck to the endgame.  Or maybe I just don't get it yet. Despite the criticisms above this remains a fascinating game.

Fun game! But I am reminded of a geekbuddy's variation on the game 'Wizard.' He starts the game on the 7th round or something like it. Due it's style, Lokomotive Werks feels like it needs a variant to aim for the 60-75 minute game length. It is definitely a keeper, though.

A surprisingly good game considering the luck factor in market demand. And that randomness feels so natural here!

Also an interestingly different game in trains theme.

After two abortive plays, not sure what to think about this. It seemed like an exercise in continual small calculations to determine your relative position and potential next move, lather rinse repeat, which I'm not sure is my kind of game. An economic game with 3 hours+ play time that [i]might[/i] come down to the final dice rolls to determine the winner might be a bit much for me.

I'd like to read more about the comparisons to Automobile, as the people in my group visibly bristled at the suggestion that LW was anywhere even close to Automobile. 

Still, an interesting idea, and I liked what I saw, even though I might not be willing to invest the time in it. Easy rules, moved fast once we hit the rhythm, although the money was fiddly and probably cost a lot of time. Definitely a "pencil and paper" economic game.

At first appears to have a low chance of catching the leader. However, after several games now, this is defintely not the case. Firstly the game end mechanisms ensure that the back markers get closer to the game leader and secondly, the game leder may vary considerably throughout the game. 
The excellent system for creating demand and then obsolence of the different engines is worth the purchase of the game itself.

It was OK, but felt like it should just be called "Math." Perhaps it was because it was our first play and I cruised that it seems there isn't that much game here. 

Bring poker chips. There's a lot of cash counting.

A brilliantly simple but opaque economic game. Reminiscent of Automobile (yes, I know this came first, but I played Automobile first). Hard to say which I prefer. 

Definitely better with more players. Don't play with three.

This game is decided and has the ability to give your opponent a runaway lead. This usually happens during the first half of the game so you end up playing the last hour and a half knowing your going to lose.  I've heard there is a patch of some sort but until I play it with said patch I'm not changing my rating.

Pretty interesting Economic Snowball game. I'd probably rate my one play a 7 ('good'), but I'm leaving it at 6 ('decent') because I think it has a fairly low staying value for me. I like the decisions, but I'm not sure that I'd want to go through the same dance many times again here. The dice can also be a bit too swingy for how strategic this game seems like it's supposed to be.

Quick and unforgiving game of managing probabilities conditioned on your estimates of the likely plans of the other players.  Can suffer from a runaway leader (or perhaps rather a fall-away-loser).

In many ways this is Automobile, but over more rounds, and without any of the extraneous elements bolted on.

:D10-4::D10-5:

Many cool decisions to be made here. Lots of subtle tactics to employ.

I wish it were easy to see the important numbers at a glance, rather than needing to calculate them every turn. You can do a fair amount of look-ahead projection in this game, and the numbers move around quite a bit, meaning you could conceivably make 20-odd calculations a turn.

I'm still pretty intrigued, and would like to try it with 4 or 5 (my recent plays were both with 3) to see how the texture changes.

OLD COMMENT: Very tentative rating. The game is practically all rhythm and timing. The information is available and easy to calculate; you just have to work hard to stay in sync with the beat of the game pace.

Someone said the winner is who can surf the wave longest. I think I agree.

Initial impression:

Luck might be a problem here; not yet convinced it's as important to the last round as it is to Pruessische Ostbahn's first two.

I really enjoyed the game mechanic of developing the engines, and the way in which the older ones rusted.  I am wary as always of the dice, but they seem well-implemented here.

The important aspect of the game seems to be, similar to Power Grid, positioning one's self to play first - the demand (and profit) is all yours.  This comes with the obvious problem of having too much money for the *next* round, for which you will therefore be lower in the turn order for, which will in turn yield less profits which will cause you to be higher in the turn order for the following round, etc.  Getting yourself to be early on the very last round seems an extremely important tactic, hampered only (hopefully) occasionally and mildly by the varying dice.

I also really hope the development of the engines plays differently game-to-game, and yields successful strategies by rushing the 330.

5-2-09:

Another interesting game.  Luck screwed over Wystan, but he kept putting himself in positions where the roll of one die was a big deal.  Never breaking out, his income faltered, and he was out quickly.

There are two things that can affect your game, one luck-driven, the other chaos-driven.  The first is that your dice can have a low/high spread across the entire game, yielding you less profits (or it can simply have low/high spreads at key moments).  The latter is what locos players get in on - if you're left alone (or only have one other person honing in on a large number of dice) because the development goes up, it's the fault of the players, but you subsequently yield a gigantic advantage.  Similarly, if players pile into your territory quickly, you'll have problems.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play with 3 players.  The game has a lot of potential.  I suspect the sweet spot is 4 to 5 players since it is too easy for 3 players to find engines where they are the sole provider.  In other words, there's not enough pressure to diversify and develop new technologies.

I'm definitly interested in more plays.  Especially with 5 players to see if my theroies about the game are true.

I finally got a 5 player game of LW in.  Let me just say it was brutal!  Ever wonder what a train game with player elimination would look like?  Well here it is.  After my experience I'm bumping up my rating to an 8.  Do not play this game with 5 players unless everyone at the table has some prior experience.  For most games 4 players is best.

The train rush of an 18XX.  Great with 5 players.  Nervous about it with 3.  Somewhat opaque, but I think less so than some of the other Winsome games I've played.  My one concern is the randomness of the dice.  I am concerned that bad/ good dice rolls could have enough impact to affect if not determine a winner.

I typically love engine building games, and this one is literally an engine building game!

Throughout the game, you'll be purchasing production facilities for various engines, and buying production capacity for them.  There is also a demand system for each engine type, where so many will be able to be sold each turn.

The crux of the game is jockeying for turn order, and deciding when to get into various facilities.  If a market is too competitive and you're late in turn order, you'll get screwed as the other players fulfill demands before you, so careful planning is needed to avoid getting burned.

I just love this type of game where you're slowly ramping up your production in a race to victory, and this is a very good one in that genre.  The only drawback with this one is that the luck of the dice can end up completely determining a winner, which is a bit frustrating for a game of this length.  It seems like a lot goes into the game only to potentially have the game decided on some rolls of the dice at the end, but this can easily happen in a close game.

Overall, I still enjoy it, but it's hard to look past the swinginess of the dice in a game that otherwise has some good decision making and posturing.

The game has problems with turn order and runaway leader.  These are not characteristics that I find pleasing, and would not call a game good or even marginal with such characteristics.  Add the fact that the game looks like something a fourth grader would make in an art class and has a $30 price tag, and you have something that equals a steaming turd in my book.  

Now I'm sure somebody will say that I hate the game because I lost, but anybody who knows me can assuredly say that this is not the case.  I love many games I regularly get trounced at, and hate games that I won on first play (Die Handler comes to mind).  My argument is that this game is not mechanically sound, so therefore it is not a good game and you shouldn't waste your time with it.

The problem with medium to heavyweight economic engine games is that a large majority of the mechanics have to be devoted to keeping a level playing field.  Some game mechanics create a level playing field by definition: auction, area influence, role selection, etc.  Engine games don't have natural leveling mechanics, and therefore must add artificial leveling systems to keep the game interesting.  Where Power Grid, an engine game with a similar feel, penalizes the lead player and creates a level system, this game very nearly rewards the lead player.
  
After the first few rounds, the game is decided.  Low demand and sales for the last player in turn order late in the game only delays the crushing for a turn. Their improved development will bring them back up to the lead again when they go first in turn order in the next round.  Low demand and sales will only happen every so often, not the whole game like it should (like it does in Power Grid).  The real problem here is that later in the game, turn order is not penalizing enough to keep the game square.  The game should penalize in some other fashion.  How exactly?  This is the problem with economic engine games.  It has to be something artificial, and it typically just hammers who was in the right place at the right time to receive the game's early rewards.  I would say it would have to take into account the development of the players.  Perhaps tallying each players development x the trains level the development rests on and imposing a R&D fee, rather than the worthless 10% tax (which does absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of this game).

Another problem I have with games like this is that there is no depth to the strategy.  The mathematics is not mind-blowing, so basically it is turn after turn of making moves with no need for reasoning or clever decision-making.  This game could play itself.  Similar to St. Petersburg, once the middle game rolls around, you could really just leave the table, because there are few agonizing decisions to be made.  The real difference is that St. Pete takes half an hour, and this one takes 3-4 times that.  Too long for me.  I was bored by turn 4.  I was already out of the game by that point with no hope of catching up.

Economic engine games require exact mechanical balance, and this game is far from that.  Don't bother.

A pure economic game of buying engines, improving how many you produce each round, and then selling them in a race to $300. The problem is die rolls determine the output of each space so you may invest in one card and have poor die rolls that have little output and cause no money gain. While the leader is last in turn order you can try to slow them down by investing in the same trains ahead of them, but if you can't afford what the leader is buying you're stuck playing catch up for most of the game and with hardly any catch up mechanism otherwise you best not fall behind early or it's going to be a long 2+ hours.

RATING: N/A
Took a first play to understand what was going on. It felt like you would have to do fairly heavy analysis especially in the early game to work out how to use your money compared to other players to get the best balance of player order/locomotive and upgrade/competition with key players. The trouble is that it is analysis to try to exploit the functions of the game system for marginal gains. There are many better economic games out there.

(11-3-12 update after third play) i think i really missed the core issue - or at least an important part of it in my earlier comment; it is about managing the pace and timing, but in the very critical context of the probabilities. Not really a surprise given that there are dice (duh), but i guess i was just so focused on making it through the grinder in the first couple of plays, i suppose i didnt really see the issues of where competition and probability intersect. 

Original comment: Very different from most Winsomes I've played. For starters, no map. Second, it has dice. Third, no shares. Fourth, no auctions. It is something of an economic snowball done right. It is really hard to judge on the first play. The game seems to really come down to exacting calculations that give you the right turn order at just the right time to slingshot at just the right time. While it has a very different feel from an 18XX train rush, it is similar in that if you don't know how the game flows, you are unlikely to manage the rush well. I don't typically subscribe to the learning game concept - I play every game to win with at least some mental model of how I expect the game to unfurl - but LW definitely made me feel like I was just playing along, trying not to screw up. I look forward to more plays, but I don't expect the central problem - timing and pace control - of the game to be that interesting for that long.

Update: After a second play, I felt much more in control, and now I'm quite sure that the central problems of the game will not interest me for long. Another Winsome likely to go on the block.

RATING: 8.5
This is, to use Michael's term, very much a meat grinder of a game. While there is subtlety a-plenty it doesn't hold its punches with the opportunities for calculation or the surrounding machinery to grind the players.  It is also oddly charming in a sort of plangently intense fashion: the beat of the trains just keeps on going, and going, and...

In short this is the train rust/rush mechanism of the 18XX abstracted fairly cleanly out into a standalone game.  As an 18XX derivative it is cleaner, more accurate and more direct than Greentown is the 18XX track planning exercise.  Thematically, Lokomotive Werks explains HOW and WHY trains rust and disappear in the 18XX.  Players buy factories and capacity for those factories and then produce trains using them to meet demand and make money.  Demand is a function of dice with a (roughly) one turn look-ahead.  There are four parallel tracks of factory-types and as newer and more profitable factories enter the game the demand for the trains from older factories progressively dries up.  The result is similar to the 18XX train rush and has similar levels of aggression, but is not as fast or as deliberately controlled (dice).

As might be expected this is a game of heavy elbows and a relentless player-driven pace.  It is also a treadmill-game: players get on and proceed to run, scramble, fall, duck and pull themselves over the heaving bodies of the other players as they lunge for the end of the game.  It is not subtle, not gentle, not genteel; elbows to throats and knees to the groin the whole way.  Unlike other related titles, there's a healthy and even heavy dose of randomness in the dice.  The randomness can be largely mitigated but it is a bit larger than I'm comfortable with and it can simply be impossible to mitigate effectively if the dice or cash don't come your way in time.  The dice can and will throw the game.  It won't happen often, there is room for considerable skill, but it will happen.  The dice also seem to make the game more tactical then I'd prefer, but I suspect that with more long term information early advantages may be be impossible to overcome.  The current random factors force a level of defensive play which acts as its own levelling stick.

While not really a calculator game as the sums are not that hard, I could easily see paper and pencil being popular.  There's a lot of nickel and onesy/twosy calculations to do each turn in planning the exact dollar counts each player will have for the next turn and thus the resulting player order for the next turn.  (Turn order is in order of increasing cash holdings)  This is more than a bit fiddly.  I'm tempted to roll capacity purchases and  Locomotive Production together into a single seamless round: Player-1 buys capacity and does his first pass Production, Player-2 likewise etc, then iterate on Production until done.  This would not change the actual game but would make the painful counting process just before Locomotive Production simpler and hopefully faster.

There is a catch-up mechanism turn order, and it is very good to be early in the turn order, but it isn't a gift.  Turn order only works for you if you make it work, and that requires care and more than a modicum of exacting planning and having the cash to execute on that advantage.  Fall too far behind and you are simply toast.  Fall a bit behind however and your weapons can be fearsome!

I could see Lokomotive Werks getting down under an hour with frequent play, but I'm not sure if any group near me has the tolerance to play it that frequently.  I'd like to try.  While not a brain burner, it is an intensely focussed exercise that would be hard to play casually.  On a similar note: There is a lot of money shuffling, so use poker chips.

Update: The exponential engine is wearing thin.  I still love the dice, but the economic snowball is too much.  Rating fdropped from 8 to 6.5

Update: I'm almost 50 plays in now (it sees steady rotation at local gamesdays).  Yeah, the snowball is annoying, but the market is just delightful.  In particular I find the multi-layered conditional probability games around turn-order and market predictions intriguing.  Rating raised back to 7.5.

Update: Half a day or so working out the cascading probabilities of various dice interactions hand thus the way that tempo maps against the cascade of factory progressions has greatly improved the game (and nearly doubled my win-rate while leaving much of the problem space attractively opaque).  Rating upped to 8.0.

Update: Rating increased to 8.5 specifically for the 5-player game.

First impressions are very promising. Werks plays a little like an 18xx without all the mucking about with shares and track laying, just down to the train rush and more than a little, as many have noted, like Automobile.

But if 18xx is a baroque-pop teenage symphony to God a la Sgt. Pepper's or Pet Sounds, then Automobile is early Elvis Costello -- still got the hummable hooks, just with a bit more punk energy and a greater emphasis on brevity. Locomotive Werks, by contrast, is something like Guided By Voices or the Replacements -- look past the buzzy noisy production and you can pick up the aching melodic sound at the heart of it. But it's very raw, and not to everyone's taste.

If that metaphor made sense, great. If it didn't, OK. But you might want to consider picking up some new music.

By this I mean that at its core, Werks is a simple, beautiful economic game, albeit one with a nasty streak and a tendency towards mathiness. (If you plot complexity of rules on the x-axis and gateway-ness on the y-axis, this one joins its stablemate Chicago Express in the lower left quadrant.) My first game had a runaway winner but if I don't miss my guess (and if the forums aren't steering me wrong) that's less a fault in the game than an affirmation of the Winsome Way -- you either like the give no quarter/accept no mercy ethos of this sort of thing or you don't, because all this game's gonna do is hand you the tools and tell you to balance your own goddamned game.

A knock-on effect of the above reveals an interesting contrast between this and Automobile: while Werks seems to superficially be more driven by chance in each game's element of chance, namely demand: the amplitude of d6s being bigger than a bagful of chits ranging from 2 to 5. And yet my games of Automobile have all gone down to the wire, and both of my games of Werks have been decisively won by the player who everyone sensed was playing smarter than everyone else at the table.

This conclusion, of course, is based on very limited experience, and I don't think I could tell you which one I prefer even if you threatened to strangle a kitten if I didn't come up with a straight answer. Not yet, anyway.

RATING: 7
Business game with a focus so narrow it makes Indonesia look as diffuse as Agricola. Killer supply and demand system that will tear up everyone but sharks. The best player might not win but a bad player will come in last place. Hard, brutal, arithmetically intense.

The line about this game is that it's 18xx's train rush turned feature presentation. This is right thematically, but it's mechanically misleading. I've actually been thinking of this game as a spiritual cousin of Puerto Rico. Without getting too literal, players here satisfy markets in a similar way to PR's shipping phase, influence turn order using similar considerations and to similar effect as PR's phase selection, and make investment decisions based on the same kind of timing concerns found in PR.

For my tastes, the game is strong. It's certainly quirky. Players in Loko Werks are essentially manipulating numbers along three axes: current production, investment in future markets, and cash relative to other players (for turn order). An unkind way to describe it is that everyone spends their time carefully adjusting the drums of a slot machine--just before pulling the handle. While there's an element of slots for sure, I think that what that really means is that defensive play will emerge as the dominant strategy. Just like in real life, aggressive development will make you a slave to the dice. This is great if the dice treat you well, and a real drag if they don't.

There is plenty of subtlety in the decision-making but there is a lot of very unsubtle arithmetical overhead to get there. It's somewhat laborious and can't be done by a computer since a lot of it involves player lookahead. Conservative play in Loko Werks is about having a diversified portfolio and enough cash to bail yourself out if demand dries up. Deciding when to commit to a market (buy lots of production), and when to expand your portfolio--i.e., invest in new technology--is tricky, high-stakes business.

I'm generally fond of Winsome's presentations, and Lokomotive Werks looks good on the table, especially once the markets really get going. The board is just a chart with nice line drawings of trains on it, a perfect match for the game's focus and tone. Its interface design is a little weak, though. While I would never accuse Winsome of putting form before function, I recommend new players to play half a game solo so they can be properly equipped to explain the game to others. The way markets behave isn't complex, but it's unfamiliar. One player running the market like a pro will really make the game flow much better.

I strongly recommend merging the production capacity phase with the first round of selling. Not only does this speed things up, it also just simplifies things and gets rid of some unnecessary obfuscation.

I love the speculative economy of this came.  It's all about opportunity, timing, and risk assessment.  I like that there are some non obvious paths to winning the game.  Chugging along in old technologies can pay off depending on the demand and the market shares your opponents have.

This is the first game I have ever played with the obsolescence mechanic, and I must say that I am very impressed. There is a little aspect of engine building, as cashflow definitely becomes less of an issue late in the game as your profits snowball, but the timing of your last investment can be critical to winning or losing.

2 players with a dummy player controlled by the later turn order player works just well enough to block any run-away leader.  Think of it as your puppet corporation.

Update:  I thought I had this thing figured out, but have been crushed in some games lately.  It seems there are some butterfly effects in this game that are hard to anticipate.  What is even better is that there has not been a dominant strategy in all of these losses.  Sometimes, the winner is on the front end of the development curve, sometimes they are on the tail end.  Some might argue that this is a function of the random dice rolls, but I disagree.  I think there is something here that I just can;t grasp and I love a game that makes me feel that way.

Lokomotive Werks is an economic engine game. Be prepared to bring your mental (or actual) calculator to the table, because it can get hairy at the end game. In essence, the game is all about buying the ability to produce engines, buying workers to produce them, and then selling the product. Simple right?

The board shows a series of potential locomotives, and has spaces for a number of dice, representing customers. Players start with the ability to produce cheap, low income engines, and the new technology becomes available slowly, based on previous player purchases. The factories and workers cost progressively more as the game goes, and it generally takes several turns to recoup the investment price, even though you can cut worker costs to some degree by using the old workers in the new factories at a discounted price.

The core of this game is the market mechanism though, which is quite interesting. There are several styles of locomotive available, and several generations in each style. As the new generation comes in, the market demand for the old technology dries up, and by the mid to late game you can actively screw other players and make them lose money by buying into the new technology quickly, which can make their old factories obsolete. 

The turn order mechanism is a bit bizarre and does not function as it intuitively should. It is completely based on cash in hand, and forces the person with the most money to go later in the order. This is a decided detriment for selling trains, but it is a decided bonus for purchasing technology. Of course, having a lot of money makes you go later, so you are going later when you presumably have the most ability to take advantage of the technology purchasing power, so it is interesting. Intuitively it seems to be a way to rein in a leader, but it does not seem to be that in practice until the very last turn or two (i.e.: you have to already be in the hunt to be saved by it then). Instead, intelligent purchasing of technology is almost always the best way to punish other players. Many new players make the mistake of always buying new technology when it is often much more advantageous to buy something the leader has a monopoly in, thereby undercutting their sales and putting the boots to them. The technology purchasing has similarities to the 18XX rust mechanism, and it is often crucial that players recognize the game state: what technology do they want to see rust or stick around? Who will be forced to buy the next technology level, even if it isn't in their best interest? Timing the rust is, to me, the key to doing well at this game, and it is fairly subtle and will likely be lost on first time players.

I find the game quite engaging, and there seem to be a number of subtleties to solid play here...when you buy new locomotive technology, who you want to compete with, how and where to invest money in workers...all tough stuff. The dice can inject some randomness into the decisions, as they will dictate what the demand is, but generally you can know one thing: if you're making the same engine as someone else, and they're higher in the order than you, your chances of selling all of your production for the round is probably pretty low :-)

I dig it though, definitely worth the price of admission.

(Side note: keeping track of money on a piece of paper shaves 30 minutes off the game, easily. I used to use chips, but now exclusively use the paper method.)

Upon first rules read: a very cleaned-up central mechanism reminiscent of Automobile. But then without the blind guess market; weird sales rules; characters; and black cubes. It's the idea distilled down to its essence, all atoms and probability and player interaction. Nothing more. I love it already, and have a strong hunch this is going to be a very fun game. 

[b]Update[/b] Oh yeah. Perhaps too mathy for most players' tastes, and thus difficult to get a feel for; and very difficult to still win if you mistime production and locomotive upgrades once the board rounds the final corner. (In the Queen Games edition, that is.) And it is quite likely that the game is lost even earlier than that because of how much upgradable production capacity you have in play. There is quite a lot to explore here. I find the increasing and decreasing locomotive capacities a little fiddly (3 generations in play is handled differently from 2 generations in play), but that should all settle in with repeat plays. Oh, do play with pen and paper; not just because it provides a massive speed up, but also because it gives you a good feeling for the ebb and flow of your cash reserve. 

I find it interesting to compare Locomotive Werks to (probably quite maligned by the general public) Ships which instead of intermingling various upgrades along a single path creates two separate but interacting paths. This seems to create a more brutal experience, in no doubt helped by the massive end point bonuses of the second track. Locomotive Werks keeps the final stage of the game quite short: once the cash starts rolling in three digit-amounts the game is nearly finished anyway. Thus you're not made aware all that much of the strength of the final locomotives. I can't help but wonder if Locomotive Werks couldn't be used as a trial annex testing ground before commencing with Martin Wallace's offering. 

My wallet also regrets that I probably need to look more closely at Splotter's Duck Dealer; I like the central mechanism.

Locomotive Werks is an economic game in which players purchase the ability to produce engines, pay workers to produce them, and sell to the volatile, dice-driven market. The game is best known for its unique market mechanism in which the demand for older train models dries up, often at a rapid pace as new technology is implemented.

Very, very dry version of Automobile.  Doesn't seem to scale at all.  We played with four, and one player was stuck in a rut with no way to get out from early on.

Stripped down 18XX, which only looks at the train rush. A little bit of luck is involved (to set demand), but it is mostly a brain burner, perfect information game. The rules are fairly straightforward even though the exact implications of any given action might not be apparent right away.

If you've played the Winsome edition, and then play the Queen: Wow - Queen went *nuts* with the overproduction (as usual). This quaint little card/dice game has become a table-space monster. Also some of the UX suffered (strange graphic design/placement choices). Those were deal-breakers with some of the folks in my local group. If you don't have that Winsome experience, you'll probably not care. It *is* a great game, based solely on play.

As with many economic games, this one follows a simple formula:  invest in a factory, invest in workers for said factory, and then produce units to sell in hopes of turning a profit over time.   Just like the real world.   Here, the whole game is designed around churn, churn, churning that machine until eventually somebody crosses the finish line with the most money.   The game is very math-heavy, and the bulk of the strategy revolves around when to invest in better locomotive factories and how long can you milk them before they become obsolete.   There is plenty of competition built into the game.   The demand for produced units, however, is utterly random.   You might see 17 units in demand one turn, and then only 3 the next.   Totally unpredictable.  So, after all that math, what's the point?   This game is a banker's nightmare - exacerbated by some annoying taxation rules which serve no purpose whatsoever other than to slow the game down.  Why not just set a higher money goal and throw out that 10% tax rule?   Plus, you can game your way around the taxes by stockpiling workers in obsolete factories.  That's gamey and counter-thematic.   But there's not much theme here anyways - it's really just a math excersize.  And that's the problem.  This game, while challenging, is far too much like work.

I like the idea of this game, but it really needs a compensatory starting player fix, for example, give each player after the start player one more dollar. We had a rich-get-richer problem such that we called the game mid-way through. I’m sure not every game can be broken like that, but it certainly can happen where the start player keeps getting richer and the last player is constantly a dollar or two short of getting back in the game. Decisions were obvious and predicated solely on the dice opportunities. I’d be willing to try again with a fix, otherwise the dice can play the players and remove any substantial decisions.

The core problem of when to invest in new technology in order to keep demand for your own products up and take away from the competition is not uninteresting. The implementation in Lokomotive Werks, however, is so linear that there is little space left for the players to actually act in, with the additional complication that for an economic snowball to be meaningful requires a certain length of play. In this case, it might be a little too much for the restrictive environment.

The dice can easily screw you over even if you are careful, but it becomes an order of magnitude more likely if you don't do your probabilistic homework. 3 players is likely not enough to cause sufficient competition.

I sense there is a lot of subtlety here, and I suspect that the luck of the dice can be largely mitigated. On the other hand, all the subtlety seems to be based around jockeying for turn order which has never been particularly interesting to me. Play time is fairly long and there's the possibility of player elimination. I wanted to like it more than I do.

Minor usability gripe: the cards could be a bit easier to read from across the table. Knowing exactly what your opponents have is crucial.

I can see this being a hit or miss with a lot of people as it is hard to be on the fence.
but if you like maths, hard decisions and an unforgiving game this could be the one for you.
You could almost class this as a surfing game in that you must be on top of the wave of locomotive developments, if you fall back it is extremely hard to catch up. But equally you can fall off the front of the wave and land hard building locomotives for a slowly developing market.

Lokomotive Werks feels like the economic heart of Age of Steam, boiled down to a base money making game, and like AoS it strikes me as brilliant, entirely dependant upon play (after the first turn), and as yet another fascintaiong offering from Winsome.

The bits and pieces seem fewer, but the decisions are just as hard if not harder than AoS, and a couple of bad ones can hose you totally, even though there is no player elimination aspect per se.

It reminds me a lot of Wallace's Automobile, without the automotive chrome and personalities. (And yes, Lokomotive Werks pre-dated Automobile by some years.)  Supply and demand are known before each round, all that is left to do is to spend money frugally, while investing in new tech at the right time, and selling cannily enough to not lose sales to other players with better timing.

It didn't completely blow me away, but it stands a fair chance of being as good or better than AoS/Steam, and that is saying a lot.  A very strong economic game!

RATING: 8
Not exactly a train game, but more of an economic optimization/race game of finished goods. Theme could be anything, be it the production of locomotives, ships, cars, or wigets. You develop factories, that produce stuff of ever increasing sophistication (and value), which are then sold for a fixed price, based on some random demand. The development cost, production capacity upgrade, and value of the finished good is increasing in a linear fashion with more technologically advanced factories. However, the number of factories is limited at each tech level, so there will be competition for those. The demand for finished goods is determined randomly with a specific number of D6, similar to Bootleggers. The number of D6 per tech level is variable as well. Thus, there are 'bottlenecks' in the tech development, so players need to decide whether to increase their factory tech level one, or save up and leap-frog. Also, factories of specific finished goods will become obsolete as technically advanced factories become available and purchased.

The turn order is based on lowest money going first, so it is a balancing act of producing just enough to go first next round, in order to get first crack at a newly available factory (of which there may only have two available, which can be cut-throat in a four-five player game), or get enough income to upgrade production capacity from a factory that is about to go obsolete.

It is deceptively easy to play, being accessible enough for newbies, but requires some considerable number crunching to do well (along the lines of Power Grid, but not as severe), which gives the game enough meat to satisfy experienced gamers. The locomotive theme may be a bit dry for some, however. Otherwise, it is engrossing, with some important decisions to be made, with very little downtime. A decent game. I rate it a strong '8'.

Update (12/15/12) 6 plays: First play with Queen Games edition. General consensus (two of us are familiar with the Winsome Games edition) is that the redesign did everything to distance itself from the functionally efficient and visually streamlined "ease" of the Winsome edition. For example, the board takes up too much space, being a huge square, with factories arranged in a "square" track, like in Automobile, instead of the narrow, long board of the original, where the factories were arranged in a top-down fashion. The center of the board is set aside for dice and money. It may be easier for access, but it just seems like a gratuitous waste of space. The worker/production markers, which used to be easy-to-handle wooden cubes, are now two-sided cardboard chits, which are clumsy to handle (and easy to flip between the "1" and "2" sides), and hard to read/count at a distance. We replaced them with mini poker chips, which slide easier across the table.

One rules tweak is that starting money is increased to 12 from 10 thalers, so that it is possible to buy the Level 3 factory during the first turn. The game is still functionally the same, but Queen is infamous for putting out huge game boxes for marketing reasons, and not because there's a lot of components--I'm looking at you, Paris Connection (which used to be SNCF). At $60 retail, Queen's huge box is literally more air than of substance. On the other hand, one is probably paying the premium for a competent, well developed and mature game (not like the typical unvetted Kickstarter fare). While I am happy that the game is finally getting the mainstream exposure it deserves, I am still disappointed in how the game was reformatted and priced.

Update (02/28/2014) 8 plays: I am beginning to see that this is a somewhat fragile (but not as fragile as [i]Chicago Express[/i]) economic snowball, and I don't like that. Starting in fourth position, was pretty much in dead last place for most of the game, and never had a chance to really catch up. Probably based on missing an opportunity to pick up a factory when I had the chance, so early mistakes are unforgivable. At the end, it all comes down to how the die rolls come out for the demand of the last three-four factories, so others have started to bemoan that it all boils down to luck in the last round or two. Still, fun to break out once in awhile, but then we remember how much of a crapshoot it is at the end. Lowering rating to a "7".

For those who want Automobile without all the silly chrome, there is Locomotive Werks.  I'm kind of amazed that a game that seems this simple works as well as it does - it's basically "Buy for a Dollar, Sell for Two: The Board Game" (though it might be more accurate to call it "Buy for Two Dollars, Hopefully Sell Enough for a Dollar to Recoup Your Investment and Buy the New Shiny Thing For Five: The Board Game").  As in many Winsome games, it does seem that at least one player will be completely left out in the cold in any given playthrough, but that may be an issue of experience.  Not sure I'd compare it to the all-time greats of the Winsome pantheon, but it is an interesting side detour of the genre.

A game that's all about the "train rush" from 18xx without sharing any similarities to 18xx at all.  This is a game about meshing your supply to the ever-changing demand curve.

I'm pretty terrible at this one, and our group has had two run away leaders in two games.  I suspect that this is a groupthink problem, however, rather than a flaw in the game.  We need to club the leader a bit more often to keep him in check.

RATING: 6
It's a fun game that invites real decisions around how quick to upgrade engines and how to upgrade capacity in a way that does not outpace nor fall behind the current demand levels. Turn order is an important factor in the decision. Turn order is also an effective catch-up mechanic (if you are moderately close...), as players with less money get to sell earlier, possibly eating up demand before the richer players get a chance to sell all that they can. While I enjoyed the game, it can get to feel a bit repetitive over 2 hours. At that length, I suspect I would always pull out Automobile, which has a few more levers to pull and creates a higher degree of tension all around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perhaps too long for what it is? Lots of rinse and repeat punctured by awesome moments of obsolescence. Until those points the most exciting part of the game is when the dice are cast and you see if your investments have paid off. 

NOTE: Non-overtly combative (read non-war or non-attacking THEME) games in my group QUICKLY turn into group optimization puzzles. People like to help one another and so suggestions are made and choices are submitted to group think. This isn't a problem if there is some hidden information; however, with perfect information games you can largely play on auto-pilot.

You maximize production to gain money which is put back into maximizing production. The choices seemed to simple. Basically spend as much to buy the best you can. Sometimes this needed to be adjusted depending on the dice roles and where you were in the turn order which affect who will produce resources. The game seemed a bit long for only requiring a simple repetitive strategy.

Seems that the core strategy mechanic is manipulating turn order, which is much better presented in something like Power Grid.

RATING: 7.5
A train game without tracks - really a production/market game with an interesting double-dollop of randomness.  The dice-driven demand mechanic adds a strong element of uncertainty that can derail the best-laid long range plans.  That said, local intra-turn min-maxing is the rule and easy to calculate and apply, for better or worse.  The game is computation-heavy which can be a turn off for some but as noted, the math is very straightforward.  

There is ample opportunity to apply sharp elbows to your tablemates, with a very unforgiving decay cycle for old technology as the game advances.  If you are too focused on squeezing the last dollar out of your existing production, you may find yourself splattered by a güter zug you never saw coming.  Though mistakes are punished harshly, the learning curve is undemanding and I believe fatal errors will be rare from a give player's second game on.  More subtle traps lurk beneath the surface of the mechanics, however, and I look forward to learning them through experience.

I'd call presentation a couple steps above the standard Winsome cheap 'n cheerful - the materials are austere but the locomotive line drawings are outstanding and lift the overall appearance of the game.  In sum, a worthy way to spend an evening.

I don't understand how this can be particularly recommended for 5 players. A 5 player game took ages (something like 3 hours), and there didn't seem to be any question about the timing of when you start to go for the end game: it was basically guaranteed that all the permanent trains would get bought -> the main point of the game was to maneuver yourself into an early position on the final turn.

Might be worth trying again with 4, I don't think I'd like a rematch with 5.

Easy rules, yet hard game to master. To me it's a timing game and trying to make your opponents "factories" obsolete.
It' s hard to play well; and monopolies are desirable. there is some luck in it. If only a second die would have been a 4 or higher in a 4P game I would have won in the previous round. Now I was 11 points short. And came in third one round later..
I like that push yor lucck element more in can't stop which has a better timeframe.
Yeah quite good. My friends thought there was too much luck I think there is some luck in thegame. But 9/10 the better player will win. IF all are equal luck decides

Having thought about it. I stand by my previous comment that luck decides in a game played by 4 equally competent players. However people who believe this is a try to mamimize your income in a round type of game are mistaken. Turnorder is crucial as the winning condition of the game is determined by reachin a goal. not a set number of rounds. Our game could have ended with two runaway leaders Gust and myself. And two players well behind. 
However keeping Gust from the victory hurt myself pretty bad. (I could have won if one of two dice turned up higher; came within 11 points) so basicly 12 points short. It gave time for one of the behind players to invest in all companies that were still available and to reck up the points.
He could have been countered by the player who ended up in fourth but he thought to play it safe.

In the end last spot had 298 points. I had 320. Gust 360 And alain 404. I know where I lost my chance of winning the game. It was a bold move trying to stop gust. and handing alain the monopoly in one company.

Want to play this again :) I know a couple of places where I made mistakes.

Unique twist to an economic game in which you are seeking to build and sell locomotives while upgrading locomotive plants and workers.  There is a fine balance between cashing out and selling a lot of lokomotives locking you into going last next turn and being limited to only selling what's left after everyone else!  Particularly in the end game, it appears you would want to be careful and try to set yourself up to go first in what you anticipate will be the last round.  Use of dice to provide randomization of supply/demand is well implemented.  Be forewarned, if you get too far behind early, it will be a long game for you as there is limited ability to catch up.  As well, be very careful in not giving anyone a monopoly in a certain type of factory for much more than a turn if at all possible or they will likely crush you.

Why would you like to make a game that resembles another one, but is much worse? Locomotive works' shows a lot of similarities with [thing=39351][/thing] from [person=6][/person], but one thing for sure is not similar, gaming fun. You could say its a bad "light" version of Automobile.

The game feels very static, very little is going on and the actions you do are very repetitive. So the game drags on and on and is decided in the last round(s). All the rest if foreplay. And in this last round, the roll of the dice can decide over win or loss. Do I really need to be counting like crazy for more than two hours to let the dice eventually decide? 

The worst performing player is rewarded with getting the starting player status, just like in [thing=12166][/thing]. But I couldn't appreciate it here as much as in 2F's flagship.

I'm sorry mr Danziger, nice try but no thank you. One play is enough.

This game is unapologetic in the way it asks you to crunch numbers upon numbers. It feeds you so much information and gives you just a few levers to pull, but how and why what which of those levers is something you need to learn however. A mean game, where you stomp on people's hopes and dreams by rusting their assets and stealing their sales.  If nothing else this game will increase your ability to do simple sums in your head by an order of magnitude. Pen & paper is recommended, and a calculator for those who aren't inclined to do the sums themselves!

It really is a vicious snowball with exquisite timing considerations - and to me at least a lot of very opaque implications of when to push, when to hold back, how much and where. 

My verdict: Slightly difficult to get to the table (you got to like arithmetic), but a fantastic, devious and fast paced game with far less luck than might first appear. Demands that players be invested lest they throw the game.

The 18XX train rush distilled down to a game.  Players are train-builders where demand for their product is both fairly unpredictable (the game comes with 20 dice) and at the same time forcing players to make meaningful calculations based on the potential and current supply potential (opponent current train-making ability + your own).

Play is repetitive: develop trains and production capacity, produce and sell trains, taxes, new demand.  The cycle continues over and over and over and would be boring if it weren't for the stiff competition in trying to out-calculate your foes and deal with out-dated train factories (with zero or diminishing demand).  The timing of these decisions is what brings depth to what would otherwise be a sparse design especially since there are some turn-order mechanics that really drive them.

After 1 play I am concerned that this game is flawed in that the "catch up" mechanism of putting the richest player in last turn order only works if the dice rolls give the other players the opportunity to buy the best contracts. 
If the dice are fairly even then the mechanism fails spectacularly! 
If the dice are not even then it creates yoyo positioning between the front runners where one will have the lead on one turn, then the second player will take the lead on the next turn.... And it is upto the dice which player will get the required £300 to win. Depending upon who wins the "catch up" either fails or gives the false impression that it has actually worked!
Plain bonkers!
Whilst I enjoy the randomness that dice can provide in a game, when a game lasts for 2 hours and can be hugely influenced by dice, then the design is not for me.

An extremely dry econocmic game, but very elegant. The fact that so many things in the game are manipulated by players rather than the simple rules, is what makes this dry game interesting. If you like econocmic simulation game, this is one that you can play in a short time and with semi-experienced players.

--- Preliminary thoughs ---

Medium economic game where you build train blueprints and sell it to a volatile dice driven market until the current model becomes obselete. You can have several models in production and constantly improve your capacity for each model (or even "upgrade" your capacity improvements for newer models).

On the plus side:
-> Few and simple rules
-> Constant and meaningful decissions each round

On the down side:
-> Too long (2 hours!)
-> Snowball effect
-> Too much money changing hands. time saver: use pen and paper to keep track of the money.


Conclusion: dry and simpler version of Automobile, but less attractive too. I don't think this game would have a decent longevity in my shelf.

Well balanced and interesting.  I like the way the game moves through the new locomotives and makes old locomotives obsolete.  I can't think of another game that compares with this one, and that's definitely a good thing.

比想像中有趣一點的遊戲
火車數值太規律
遊戲重點是順位，每回合能先賣火車的人有極大優勢
特別是在訂單很少的時候
所以一定不能讓一個玩家壟斷某種火車
特別是綠色的
規則:
*一個玩家丟三顆骰放圖版綠色一級火車左邊三格，在擲一顆放紅色一級中間格
*每人拿12圓跟一張綠色一級火車卡上面放一個面值1的生產標記，玩家順位卡洗勻隨機發
**五人時 起始14圓，沒有火車卡，丟一顆骰放綠色一級火車中間格
*遊戲進行數輪，每輪有五個階段，當第四個階段結束時有玩家有300圓遊戲結束，最多錢的勝利
1.發展階段  每人照順位可以支付左上金額拿一張還有且不重複的火車卡(有骰的)，如果拿的是骰子在中間格的把該骰移到左邊格，在丟一顆骰放到順時鐘的下一個火車中間格，拿到卡片時上面都放一個面值1的生產標記
*當高級的同色火車卡進場時，把低兩級的火車卡從牌庫移除
2.提升生產標記 每支付中間價格一次可提升一級，無上限，可把價格較低的生產標記移到價格高的火車卡上付差額
*升級後無生產標記的火車卡移除
3.生產 照順位一次賣一種火車卡，進行多輪直到沒得賣，該火車必須在左邊有骰子，如果生產標記數值有對應骰點則將該骰從左邊移到右邊，如果都不相同且比最高的還小則將最高骰點的下降對應數量，如果比最高的還大則移最高的，將對應移動骰點數值的生產標記上移代表賣出，價格等於數目乘上卡片右上數字
*全部人賣完後將生產標記放回
4.付稅 每人扣除10%的金額，向下取整，如果有人超過300圓則遊戲結束，沒有的話則跟據錢的少到多，拿新的順位，平手順位不變
5.市場需求 每種顏色火車分別結算，最新時代的火車如果總骰數小於右邊格數加一顆到右邊，低一級如果是最低的移除一顆右邊的(沒右邊移左邊)，如果不是則補到總骰數等於右邊格，如果有其他更低級的骰子全移除，之後把右邊重骰放到左邊格

There is an interesting core concept/mechanism, but I think this game needs serious streamlining. Only the middle-third contained interesting, non-obvious decisions.

On a side note: Using 25$-cpins in a game where you have to calculate 10% of your income (nobody knows why) is not a good idea.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: A strict stock market game where you buy shares in train manufacturers roads and try to upgrade them quickly so that they don't become obsolete. The dice represent the demand of the trains you produce and you must deliver them before others use up the demand, but the demand can fall quickly form round to round so you must upgrade and turn order is very important. I tend to like these games but this one was just purely mathematical, a lot of calculations and not that fun.

Finally (!) managed to play this game. I'd been pretty intimidated by it actually, given its obtuse reputation and calculation involved for the play. 

To my astonishment, I won, and not by a little either. I think I made some good decisions, in what factories to purchase, and I was helped by my opponents letting me get a monopoly for too long in a profitable engine. And I was helped by good dice rolls.

This is an interesting economic game that can be best compared to Automobile, a game that probably got its inspiration here.  You're setting up factories for and producing different types of locomotives; as the game progresses older locomotives become obsolete, and newer ones become available.  The amount each locomotive type is demanded is determined by a series of random die rolls--but unlike Automobile, it's determined at the beginning of the turn, so everyone knows what number they should collectively be shooting for.  While turn order is important, you can't be totally shut out of selling a particular line, because the players in front of you cannot sell more than one die's worth of engines at a time.  Additionally, having obsolete factories isn't that big of a penalty, as you can upgrade them at a reasonable cost.  So basically, the game is more forgiving and calculable than Automobile.  And, like many Winsome products, the components are awful.  Also, it doesn't play particularly well with 3, as there isn't enough competition in lines.

RATING: 8
The dice, while usually not a problem, can be frustrating. There can be a runaway leader problem if the other players are not paying close attention. Overall, it's a pleasurable game that isn't ultra intense but interesting enough to play. Lacks really creative decision making and instead requires a lot of math. It is unforgiving. Do something stupid early in the game and forget catching up in most cases. This isn't going to make it into the favorites list, but it's innovative and elegant enough to get a significant number of plays.

RATING: 7
I suggest to play this with a house rule: players are only permitted to sell one type of locomotive in their turn. So there are much more interesting decisions in the game. The game might run a bit longer because of this, but at least there is more gameplay and smart plays than just accounting work.

Very spartan accounting exercise that still manages to present enough decisions in each turn to be called an interesting game. The way the dice are used for determining demand is very clever and works really well.

RATING: 5.4
Rating after one play. Although it possess a quite simple and streamlined ruleset, this game continues far longer than my level of interest can be sustained. Much like Power Grid a player needs to manipulate the turn order (determined by the player with the least money at the end of the round) to be the first to play as the last round begins. Unfortunately, dice rolls can thwart this effort. Also the balancing that occurs through turn order and the obscelence of factories made me feel like we were all more or less even going into the last round and the 120+ minutes prior was an effort in futility. The last round determines the winner. This plus the increasing level of downtime due to increasing calculation of income through orders as the game progresses will probably find me decline future offers to play. Oh, and the quality of the components is abysmal!

An enjoyable abstracted 18xx train rush, where you try to keep up with the purchasing whims of dice-driven market demands for better and better train engines. 

There's definitely a neat game here, but it's a wee bit longer than it ought to be, and it is almost painfully snowballish -- once you fall behind, you're screwed.

In LW, dice represent market demands and work well as a mechanism though it makes the game (really the market) very volatile. The game is in using your player order strategically against other players in reaction to market demand, as well as manipulating when technology becomes obsolete. Get rid of the money and track with pen/paper.

Interesting first play w/ 4P.  In hindsight, some timing mistakes by the players were critical emphasizing the fact that this is a game of efficiency and mistakes will be costly. 

Each turn you need to watch your cash on hand which goes out as fast as it comes in, but hopefully one is earning more as the game progresses.  So the game is about optimizing how to spend the cash to yield the greatest returns as the demand for the locomotives shifts over time.

--Feb2010-- Tried it out in mock 3p fashion: fascinating system; interested in trying it with real opponents.  Sadly, the first such attempt scared some of my regular gaming group:  it appears there are a few sharp edges with 4 players when the initial demand is very low.  I'm still amused - but it might be a while before I get it back to the table.

It appears to be a excellent system:  clean, understandable, and difficult to evaluate.  On the other hand, Automobile doesn't look as derivative of this as I'd been lead to believe.  I think there's room in my collection for both!
--Feb2012-- Played with 5 - which should (in theory) be more fragile than the previous play with 4.  Really nice game.

One or two more plays will allow me to speak more readily about how much I like this game. For now I am giving it a provisional 8. 

Based on my first play with three players, this is a very interesting game. There is a large economic snowball element, and we knew by the end of the second turn that our friend Evan had probably won the game. I believe that this was due to myself and the other player not upgrading to newer technologies fast enough. That combined with the fierce and volatile market in the game killed us. Evan had more demand than supply, and David and I were left fighting over too little demand. This allowed Evan to run away with it. I have a feeling that four or five players may be more fun and allow for more competition of resources to prevent such a large snowball. 

Time and plays will tell.

Train Rush: The Game.  If you want to like 18xx, but find the stocks, and rail building superfluous and cumbersome this is the game for you.  This is fun enough to play along with, but it runs a little long for my interests, sadly I see the necessity of the length.

It is a perfect information game, once the dice have been rolled so it is easy to optimize what your production allotment and sales are going to be when it comes to your turn, but impossible to plan for it until then.  Very chaotic, and heavy on luck.  I can't imagine wanting to play this with five.

I get concerned because I won soundly against great players without over-thinking it.  If I win, it usually means there is too little real skill.

First game impressions: 5 player game

The game was deliciously tense with frequent tight upgrade and purchase cost vs. benefit analysis type decisions to be made.  In my opinion, Lokomotive Werk's unremarkable, but serviceable and easily understood game components actually facilitate ease of play.  

Also, with relatively few and uncomplicated rules, game play is where this game really shines.  
In some games the mechanics drive the game play, but here it is chiefly the players' decisions that direct the flow of the game, which is fitting since LWs is essentially a pure economic game at heart. It is the unpredictability of those players' actions that keep Lokomotive Werks from feeling like a dry exercise in number crunching. 

The dice do play a major role in play, but there are ways to mitigate the randomness so it does not seem too powerful a factor to deal with.  It is also not possible to do much if any long-term planning during others' turns, which could potentially lead to some downtime between player turns, especially with AP prone folks. There are however really not a lot of decisions to be made each time around so in our game at least, everyone seemed to be constantly engaged in watching to see how others' actions were going to affect them, that it didn't seem to be a problem for us. 

Overall - We all had a very good time!

After a 1st play, there SEEM to be several problems:
- relatively few choices: just buy the biggest loco factory you can afford as soon as you are able?
- early mistakes are fatal: there is a significant rich-get-richer factor. You would think the turn-order mechanism (poorer goes first) would help mitigate this, but it actually hurts: it ensures that the player with the most money goes last, and can buy an even higher-level loco which will preferentially destroy the income of the poor player
- too much counting. The math is simple -- what's the total production capacity for a given loco, and what is the demand? But playing with people who insist on counting everything every turn is just a bit annoying 'cause it takes too long!

Still, I need to try it again now that I know how badly I screwed up the first time!

What a brutal train rush.  Despite the person with the least cash going first, it is very hard to catch up.  Turn order doesn't so much hold back the leader as provide another resource to be manipulated.  The turn order is VERY important on the turns when new trains are bought and pretty important in the last couple turns. 2009/07/05

I'm a bit underwhelmed by my first experiences.  The mechanics are interesting and remind me greatly of Automobile (which I very much like).  But gameplay is very linear and choices are therefore rather limited.  And it seems very hard to catch a leader (particularly one who gets the single first level blue factory and has some lucky rolls).  Despite all this, the game would still be okay if the amount of bookkeeping and calculation didn't push playtime well past overstaying its welcome.

Excellent economic game but only for players that like economic games. If you like games like Starship Merchants, this game is for you!

RATING: 7
Rating is tilted somewhat upward due to appreciation for this spartan design which does nothing beyond what it needs to do to demonstrate the concept. And yet it's still a meaty game.

Basically players establish factories (in a personal tableau, not on a map) to satisfy demand whose quantity is determined by dice that will have been rolled. Gradually new technologies can be purchased which cause demand to gradually shift away from older products to the newer products.

Turn order is important, as the first player will get first ability to sell to each market. Turn order goes to whoever has the least money on hand each turn.

I don't quite get how to think about the most important strategic question of when to open up new technologies (which is expensive) and when to hold back. In theory it seems you should open it up when it will hurt your opponents more than yourself, but it often strikes me as a wash.

The game is full of tactics as well, as you want to upgrade your factories in the short term to try to best match the selection of demand that will be available to you when it's your turn to sell. Or you can try to ensure that nothing good will be left to those who go after you.

It is the best Winsome game I've played, but considering that I hated the other two, that isn't saying much.  Mechanics are interesting, and the dice add some flavor, something that Winsome games desperately need.  There's a significant rich-get-richer problem here, though.  The leader can jump out to an early lead, and then coast to victory through better income, and thus better access to trains.

Not that good of a game.   

The game is about building locomotive engines and its main gimmick is the "train rush mechanic" from 18XX games where trains become rusted and, eventually, obsolete.   

The opaqueness comes from the fact that all players' factories, coins and ability to produce is publicly visible to all players; so you already know who can sell what, how many they can sell and whether they will sell at all.  

At lower player counts the ability to sell becomes even more opaque and our group felt there were no real decisions to be made, except whether to buy a factory, whether to produce or not.

Further, the linear progression of each train's costs, incomes and production costs further enhances the illusion that the only decision in the game is to keep buying new locomotive engines; except I feel that this is a newbie mistake.

This opaqueness and linear progression really masks the true modus operandi of this game -- its really all about manipulating turn order so that you can sell first and have certain factories with low competition.

If players realize this, then the turn order's importance will result in players' buying a lot of production so that they don't hit the tax threshold or at least getting into a position that they squeeze out of the competition.

In some respects the game projects players the idea of creating a sales forecast with perfect information.

However, no matter how many times I've played this game, people go through the motions and suddenly get bored because it feels the game is playing automatically, that there are not enough hard decisions to be made and that because everything is opaque that unless people try to compete in factories you can play without humans as all decisions seem to be automatic and binary.

Further there are no other routes to success; it doesn't feel like you can have an impact on sales market, there is no such thing as marketing and its not really as in depth as it could be.

Despite all of this, I'm still drawn to playing this game every now and again.

The game really only shines at 5 people.

Overall I give this game a 5/10

After one play:  Economic engine game that's similar to the Outpost/Sceptre of Zavendor/Phonecia family without the auction mechanics.  Interesting, but potentially damaged by the random mechanic of generating demand via dice.  

It's possible that we fell prey to group think and there's something we overlooked, but my initial feeling was "it's fun, but why aren't we playing Outpost?"  Requires another play to be sure, but I suspect my rating will drop as time goes by unless something surprises me strategy wise.

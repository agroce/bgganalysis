RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play of the first mission.
Enjoyed it, but not as much as Doom.
Seemed less intuitive and slower.
Playing with four seemed to mean too much time waiting for your turn.

Want to play again.

Played again 4 player. Wow, my previous description was correct, except even worse. At one point I dosed off.

I will admit to not having played the video game, but I found this to be an interesting play. I found the dual card usage a little unsatisfying, but it's certainly a clever twist on things. Not a bad game either. Haven't had much experience with the Mission Packs yet. I don't know if that improves things at all, but they'll certainly get a shot at some point.

This game is a grind. It's slow and the rythm isn't as brisk as I might like. Also, it's kind of a cold game that rarely surprises me. There is strategical thinking involved but you can pretty much kick ass once you get a handle on it. I feel like I might be done with this game after about 8 solo plays. I do wonder if the expansion improves things at all.

Not a fan of this one. Dragged a too long for me in a 4 player game. The long time between character plays was quickly losing me. Fairly rewarding when you beat a Locust but it's just a bit too repetitive. I also really don't like that mechanic that Order Cards represent your health throughout the game.

Love the 360 games, this game really brings the theme through.  Everything plays very cleanly and the no GM is great.  Needs big box expansions though, more characters from the series, more minis, etc.

First game took forever to get going it seemed, but we made the mistake of punching out, reading rules, and trying to play all on the fly. Once we got rolling it went really well, but halfway through the rules reading, we all thought we had made a huge mistake. I think this will be fun to pull out next time as it flowed fine once we got going, but the length of play might make it harder to get to the table too often.

I quite like this modular dungeon crawl -- it's pretty Ameritrashy but surprisingly crunchy. Good solo and with up to 4, though the variant rules on the forum (draw one card on every player's turn instead of drawing two on your own) help to smooth out the difficulty a lot.

Some of the mechanics are interesting, the figures are great, but we played the same scenario twice, and twice we were lost in the first part of the scenario. Maybe we are bad players, or maybe it is unbalanced. I don't think I'll find out which one it is.

Played the first half of our game:
I like the game, the theme is present, and the game seems to flow well once you've played a couple of rounds. It does last a lot, we've stopped playing after about 2 hours into the game, but it was a positive experience.

Definitively on my list to play once in a while.

A dungeon-crawler set on Sera, the planet of over-the-top cinematics and beefy armored marines.

So far so good.  

The box contains a bunch of double-sided map tiles, a couple decks of cards, a ton of well-done miniatures for your Gears and their Locust enemies, and tokens for ammo, grenades, and damage.

The game takes a while to set up.  After selecting a scenario, you must then build the board by digging through the 20-ish tiles to find the 8 that you want, grab the "General" (the ones that don't say "For each Theron Guard" or similar) locust activation cards indicated by the scenario, find the minis and appropriate tokens and cards for each of the three enemy types in the scenario (you should probably find yourself several smallish boxes: one for Drones, one for Kantus, one for Tickers, etc.), grab the starting materials for your characters, and set up the board.  

Every round, you'll (almost always) play an action card from your hand.  Generally, these are some combination of moving (which is just counting spaces on the modular board) and shooting (performed by rolling custom d6's against the defender's custom d6's), though there are a few others. Cards can also be played on somebody else's turn as some sort of response action.  After each of your turns, you'll flip a card from the locust activation deck, and one or more of the enemies will move and/or shoot. Use these cards to shoot and chainsaw your way through the half-dozen different Locust to get to your objective.  Each mission has several steps, but most mission objectives can be described as "Go Here", with something special for the final objective.

The game can get slow: as in the video game's campaign mode, you'll decide between either sitting in cover waiting for your health to recover, or pushing forward in order to not take three hours to do a mission, but reducing your chance of succeeding in the process.  The downtime factor is mitigated somewhat by the ability to play a card on other players' turns, but is still significant.

Fantasy Flight does a great job of capturing the feel of the game, which I'm sure FFG fans aren't surprised to hear.  I mention this both as a positive factor for fellow Gears players and as a caveat: my opinion of it is likely biased by the fact that when I first played it, I was playing the video game version in about a third of my free time.  I'm a fan of the series, and I suspect that anyone else who is will also be impressed by how much the game captures the feel of the series (The only thing that is bugging me: Theron guards don't feel...right. Not sure why). 

I believe there are some differences in the power level of the four Delta Squad members, and not enough differences in the Locust types, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.

I really enjoy this game, and I'd certainly recommend it to a fellow GoW fan, or dungeon-crawl fans.  I'd semi-recommend it (in a try-before-you-buy sense) to anyone else, provided they have the patience and table space for it.  Given the modular nature of every aspect of the game (and the Fantasy Flight logo on the box) I'm eager to see what they do with the first expansion (and hoping it includes my favorite Gears).

Good Sci-Fi tactical, pure co-op dungeon-crawler game. Nice miniatures. The game is quite thematic (I haven't played the videogame in order to judge if it captures the feeling) and the whole 'your order cards is your life points' mechanic is great. It limits your options as you take hits. The imporoved A.I and the 'cover' mechanic make this game much better than the Castle Ravenloft and the others of the D&D series. The game flows well and it is quite hard to bit. Tense gameplay.  The box feels a bit light, FFG should have put a bit more stuff in it, like more miniatures and tokens.

Criminally underrated.  The missions that come with the game are brutally difficult (especially with more than four players), but the game actually shines if you customize the missions.  You customize the terrain layout and the variety of enemies that spawn.  If a mission is too difficult, modify it.  Brilliant A.I. also, by the way.

A pure cooperative dungeon crawler that substitutes the DM/Overlord for a deck of AI cards. This works surprisingly well although the excitement of drawing AI cards can be subsided when its conditions cannot be fulfilled and you're asked to draw another card and another. Still, the game is tightly designed and follows the story arc of the video game series.

Excellent game, with a unique concept.
You could think this game is just a random bad game with a video game name. You couldn't be more wrong.

The card driven action is one of the most clever i've ever seen in a boardgame. The ennemy AI is really nice, and offers some strategic tough decisions. Each card id both your possible actions AND your health! So you can often choose to play more than one action, but it means litterally to lose one precious health. 
The ammo mechanic is really well implemented. 
Overall, it's Doom as it should have been.

Each mission tastes really different, and the components are gorgeous. Only defautl is the number of ennemy miniatures when you play with the max players, which can be tight. 

Its main default: not supported anymore.

Parece increíble que diga esto de un juego con esta temática pero (en mi opinión) resulta terriblemente aburrido y repetitivo.

El mapa, aunque modular, consiste en un único pasillo por el que los jugadores avanzan disparando a todo lo que se menea. Los enemigos se colocan al montar el mapa, no existen caminos alternativos ni eventos inesperados. Lo que ves es lo que hay, ni mas ni menos. Cuando se llega al final del pasillo se pasa a la siguiente fase y se monta el siguiente pasillo. Normalmente son necesarias 3 fases para finalizar una partida.

El alcance, la cobertura, la línea de visión y el movimiento son conceptos abstractos que apenas influyen en los combates. Los enemigos poseen diferentes características pero tienen algo en común: Todos te pueden machacar de un solo golpe. Algunos con mas facilidad que otros pero todos pueden fastidiarte el día con una tirada de dados. Esto provoca la sensación de que da igual a quien ataques. Será la suerte la que decida si vives para ver tu siguiente turno. Por último decir que las acciones vienen determinadas por cartas, si no tienes la carta correcta no puedes hacer la acción que deseas. Así de fácil.

Resumen de un turno de juego:

El turno del jugador se resumiría en algo como esto: 
-Robar dos cartas sin sobrepasar el límite de su mano.
-Jugar una carta y ejecutar las acciones que aparecen impresas. Normalmente son cosas como moverse y atacar o atacar y luego moverse (yeah!). Algunas cartas solo permiten realizar una de las dos acciones.

Tras el turno de cada jugador hay un turno de IA (Locust)

Se roba una carta de IA que suele consistir en lo siguiente:

-Si no quedan Locust del tipo indicado aparecen nuevos.
-Si hay Locust cerca atacan.
-Si los Locust están lejos se acercan.
Si una carta de IA no puede aplicarse se ignora y se roba otra hasta que se cumpla unas de las condiciones anteriores.

Le toca al siguiente jugador...

Good game, enjoyed it, but just too light compared to the time it takes. 
A matter of taste. 
If I have to spend 4 hours or more on a game, I prefer to do it on a heavy civ game, or on a dungeon crawler with leveling and inventory management (or a real rpg...), than on this.

Well done transition of video game to board game. Great co-op AND solo play, which does not require an "Enemy" player as in Descent and Doom; all enemy action is handled by an excellent AI card mechanic.

Probably my favorite solo miniature dungeon crawl type game because of the cool AI and the inclusion of a scenario.  Being a FFG product, the components are all very nicely produced.  Good combination of dice and card play.  Interesting mechanic of your hand is your life.  As you lost life, you also lose options, which seems thematic. 2 characters is the way to go.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: Finely detailed miniatures, thematic cards, and thick floor tiles are just some of the wonderful components in this successful "run and gun" cardboard adaptation of the classic videogame. The AI is simple and not fiddly, which allows the game to flow smoothly. There are enough tense moments in the game that the players' energy and momentum is maintained throughout the session. 

10 Plays: Although at first glance this seems like a beer and pretzels game, there's certainly more depth to it than meets the eye. In particular, having to manage your dwindling hand of cards can be stressful. I enjoy the fact that I can teach this game to new players in under 5 minutes. The cooperative nature of the game make for some interesting tactical discussions mixed in with copious amounts of bravado and stereotyped banter. I still haven't completed all of the missions and am looking forward to the user-created content as well. I guess I'll just have to keep playing.

First mission disappointed me. But the other missiosn are so much more entertaining. The game captures the video game really well. 

I do not like the recycling of the minis for other monsters. But beside of that the AI system works really well and gives the different Locusts an individual touch without being too predictable.

I wish that we will see a few expansions in the future. But up for now: The base game is a blast to play and so intense! Get the Gears of War Soundtrack and let the ride begin!!!

RATING: 6
Pretty fun, but always feels either to easy or horribly face melting. AI deck may be improved by spawning additional enemies instead of drawing a new card, as the tendency is to burn through it over and over if you balance keeping just one enemy of a group alive so the enemy turn is negligible. Either that or they spawn on your head, melt your face off, and clobber any other players left standing afterwards.

Played the game 4 times and it is a fun game to play with friends.

I consider it slightly under the 3 Dungeons and Dragons games (Ravenloft etc...), because these 3 have a little more variety, but if you are into SF or played the video game, I think you'll have a blast.

Best experience was the last scenario against a huge boss. A whopping 4.5 hours playing time. Very very close, but we lost.

The game takes too long though in general and the play becomes a bit stale after 3-4 plays. Not enough variety in both mobs (monsters) and cards.

Great game with a lot of tension.  The material (tiles, cards and figures) is just superb in a gritty way.
Some folks don't like the health points system, but at least it's innovative!
The major drawback is the pace and length of the game : what should be a quick and brutal slugfest / dungeon crawler  feels like it's played at a snail pace for hours...

Very fun, thematic, and intense coop/solo game. The components are high quality. I love the "orders" cards concept where your hand of cards represents what you can do on your turn and your health. Just wish I could track down a copy of the mission pack for less than an arm and a leg.

This game wants you to die, plain and simple. It's hellishly difficult, but at the same time very engaging as you plan your actions with your comrades in arms and take painful decisions (the cards-as-life mechanics are brilliant).

This game is the epitome of an 8 for me after four full plays and two runs at it solo to learn it, I can say this is one I will not turn down. It is brutal and in your face and it does invoke a property I do not have a past with, having never played any of the video games this is based off of. It does not matter. FF had a really good product here with this one and it is a shame that it is now OOP with very few prospects of being expanded upon in its current form. If the title's brutal brand of monster slaying happens to come along wearing another coat of IP paint, it may be worth the pick up just because. If there is any justice however, the new parent company over at Asmodee will foot the bill and green light a supplemental run at this monster mash, and give us some fleshed out characters missions, and minis for the monsters.

At first, I was not really fond of the card system, but the more I play the game, the more I like it. 

Once you get the hang of the game, it is quite streamlined.  We have had games last 15 minutes, however, our last game lasted 2 hours (we had to retreat to the beginning of the map to pick up more grenades).

I highly recommend this game to any Gears of War fan, and to co-op combat gamers in general.  Give the game a few play-throughs...it takes 2-3 to really get completely used to the turn-flow, after that, the player/opponent turn is really second-nature.

I purchased this game cheap through Fantasy Flight.  The game works great for me, because I do not enjoy learning minute tactical rules in combat games as I struggle to retain the little rules when I play the game again.  

Gears of Was quite fun and simple enough to learn and retain if not played as often as you really would like.  I love the tactical solo play, and the system is easy to understand and execute.  Some of the minis look the same, but a quick paint job fixes that nicely.  

I really can recommend this game to may who want a fun, light, dice fest with a few rules to learn.  I learned it is no time at all with the universal head rules.

5 plays.  Solid game.  Much better than the D&D Castle Ravenloft purely co-op games.  Difficulty seems sufficient to keep things interesting (I detest easy co-op games.)  While I respect keeping your hand hidden to discourage alpha gamers from dictating all the potential plays, one thing I like about Doom is that since everything is out in the open (and Doom is really tough to win), that this generates a lot of discussion.  Currently, I feel Doom is the better experience, but maybe with if we played with open hands there'd be more discussion and cooperation.  (Not that we lack cooperation as is.)  The hands of cards mean less involvement in another player's turn.  Furthermore we like playing Doom so you can freely dictate the order in which the marines go, which allows a lot of discussion and planning.

Also, it seems like the tension of the missions can vary: like at the beginning, things aren't very tense and you're sitting pretty with 4+ cards in hand.  Then suddenly things take a sharp turn for the worse.  Maybe this isn't a bad thing.  Unlike Doom the fact that you heal over tike might make things less tense as opposed to having truly finite resources.

Variant: play with hands as public knowledge.

Game was a good reflection of the video game. Cover is very important, so is maintaining a group formation. You ride the edge of being down to take one more shot. But this tires faster as a game than a video game, unfortunately.

Very fun game. Love that it comes with 7 scenarios and everytime you set even the same one up the variability of the board tiles and card draws make every game very different. Mechanics are very easy and then strategic decisions are rich with LOTS of theme. The video game players say this replicates that version to the "T". Can't get enough of this game right now. One of the only games that I totally didn't agree with Drakkenstike on in his video review. Very exciting and different each time.

RATING: 5.5
A challenging total cooperative game in which the bad guys seem to re-spawn without end, forcing players to work together well and regularly sacrifice themselves to advance the team.  Unfortunately, the near-relentless wave of bad guys combined with unlucky dice rolls can make this game drag on for way too long.  After 2 hours of playing one of the beginner scenarios, we had only completed stage 1 of 3; all of us had an okay time slogging through the stage, but we were exhausted from the repetitiveness and snail's pace progress.

So happy to have a copy now. I like the idea of the card hand beeing your health points. And that your actions depend on the cards you have. Sometimes you would like to move quickly but the card for it is missing. Very well balanced, in the end its a narrow path if you win or lose.

No nothing of the background, but it doesn't really matter - grab your weapons and go into the building, and try not to get killed by the hordes of bad guys.

Semi-random map setup helps, and it's nice being fully co-op. Sculpts are good (although it's hard to see which 'COG' is which ...). Overall, like it a lot - fun tactical squad game, might need more missions if it sees a lot of play.

2nd Mission (China) seems very hard, but we probably haven't worked out the optimal tactic to beat it yet!

Very good tactical shooter. Many others failed in trying what this one did accomplish: A fast and intense gameplay with great atmosphere and meaningful tactical decisions. In addition you have to work as a team. The card mechanics are simple but make a lot of sense. Art and minis are great. Good combat system and finally a game where terrain does matter. Sadly no longer supported by FFG but at least they gave us a card expansion, wich adds even more replayability!

A fun and light tactical game. As is typical with FFG games, there are lots of pretty bit. My only real complaint is that the little mission cards prevent a more descriptive set-up instruction. It isn't always clear exactly how you are suppose to lay things out. If the came with large set-up cards, they would have the space for clearer instructions. That and 3 of the cog models are a bit too similar in stance. If you paint the figures, it's easy to tell them apart. Unpainted is another matter.

RATING: 9.5
I got GoW for Christmas, and I must admit, I was a bit nonplussed. It had been at the bottom of my list, and I have no interest in the property it's based on. It mainly got added to my want list because everyone said it played well with 1, and it is tactical combat, with an A.I. I've liked some of Konieczka's earlier titles, but they never wound up staying in my collection. I was further chagrined because the maps are big enough, I had to buy a table it would fit on (thanks be to the Target gift card I also received).

Well, after two plays, I'm pretty impressed. The game play is like buttah - after a few games, the mechanics are easy-peasy. What's more, the A.I. works great, and the game scales incredibly well; except for one scenario, no having to juggle multiple characters. Equally great is that the scenarios are randomized enough that if one play happened to be somewhat easy, further plays are not worthless, as the random setups and semi-random A.I. allow the toughness to fluctuate. What really sold me is the amount of tension in the game. It plays like Space Hulk, if Space Hulk played well solo and didn't suck! It delivers the feel of fighting a horde without taking it as damn literally as Space Hulk does. Even though I don't have any feelings about the video game, it is easy to see that it feels like a video game (you can run past the aliens, perform interrupts in a very elegant and easy way, and the China Shop scenario has that running from the boss feel down cold). Yes, I've been getting into it enough to be inspired to make explosion and dying sound effects from time to time. This one is a sleeper - too bad FFG decided to kill it off rather than expand it. As it is, though, there is a ton of replay value in the box. I can happily see this one sticking around for a long, long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The components are great and the artwork is great, but the gameplay...meh.  I have some gripes:

1) The COGs are too similar.  That matches the video game but it makes the board game repetitive.  Everyone has basically the same weapons and is making the same decisions using the same set of actions.  I would rather have specialization within the squad: a sniper, a close-combat guy (flamethrower), a demolition guy, etc.

2) The game takes too long, which amplifies the repetitiveness.  The regular missions are 3+ hours, unless you die early.  With a run of "bad luck" you can spend 15 - 20 minutes doing nothing but digging in to heal and dodging bullets.  It gets old.

3) The game quickly teaches you to leave at least one "A" locust alive on the board (and possibly leave a "B" and/or "C" depending on the AI cards in play).  If you don't do this, Locust will spawn and sometimes in spectacular fashion (like 2 Lambent Wretches spawning at each hole within 4 moves of you).  I find this boring and thematically wrong.  The COGs should be blowing away every Locust they see, not "all but one".

I might play this every once in a while but it's not going to a favorite.  Space Hulk Death Angel has a similar feel but is quicker & tighter.

I may change my rating after a few more plays.  The game was fun and I enjoyed it.  It just didn't seem to have a lot of depth.  A little team coordination and planning, but mostly straightforward miniature exploration and combat.  Some of the other scenarios may add to that, but for a first exposure it wasn't anything worth getting totally excited about.

Fun and simple, hope that it gets better with more plays.

A very clever board game adaption with a surprising amount of tactics involved. Everyone plays against an 'AI' deck of cards that offer a lot of variety, due to how they're written. For example, one enemy type has an AI card that will make them gang up on an already-woulded COG/player, while the much-feared beserker can generally only attack players in the same area. Combine this with an order card system that doubles up as your health (take too many actions too quick, and you may find yourself in big trouble) and you're in for a fun, tense game. 

One slight problem - even the first scenario can take a while, and you'll need to set a few hours aside for the longer ones. You're in it for the long haul...

I don't care about the Gears of War franchise at all as it's generic and uninteresting, but the board game is damn good mechanically. One of the few thematic games where I ignore the theme entirely in favour of mechanics.

Gears of War is a pretty neat game. The difficulty seems about right but the lenght is a bit too much for me (not that I don't like long games, but this game feels like it should run quicker).

RATING: 8
Probably my favorite pure co-op dungeon crawler. You make real tactical decisions, something that I think other dungeon crawlers miss out on. It certainly feels like you can play this well or poorly, which is awesome.  Love the dual-purpose cards and hand management aspect along with variety in AI cards so the same monster types always act just a little different.

I also really like how the scenarios play totally differently.  You have to tackle them with completely different play styles which I love.

My only real complaint is that the difficulty doesn't quite scale that well with more players... it seems to get harder.  Maybe that's just due to lack of experience, but with more monsters on the board due to more players it seems like it's easier for monsters to swarm the players.

Still, I've had a ton of fun with this so far.

This game really grew on me, especially in solo play. I really like the granularity of the movement and the elegance of combat. Dungeons & Dragons: Legend of Drizzt isn't granular enough and Descent is too granular. I enjoy the simplicity of the combat system and the LOS rules. The cover rules are very easy to apply and make for some quick combat. In short, this game achieves a lot through its abstraction and yet still provides a good narrative without needing a GameMaster.

My friend got this and I was initially pumped to play it. However after the first game fun wears off it quickly loses its flair. The game can drag on for hours depending on the campaign that you are playing and who is playing with you. The game itself is not hard, but the monsters in it are very tough. You would think that entire purpose was to destroy the players will to live after playing for over an hour. You can go on a rampage and kill six monsters in one turn and then they all respawn and you have no more ammo to fight them. The game also uses your hand size as your life which is just horrible both thematically and game wise. You basically kill your self any time you do anything. The game itself looks amazing and was produced beautifully. To bad the game play doesn't match how great it looks.

I like this game, but it is not without issues.

The hand management is good, the theme is good, the overall idea is generally pretty solid, but I have some issues with some of the main mechanics-- notably, it almost encourages "gamey" behavior-- i.e. leaving one enemy on the board to not spawn more enemies, running past a hoard of enemies to open a new door (because you can't spawn more than miniatures you have), etc.

Also, the nature of the dice means that they can be EXCEPTIONALLY swingy.

Played "The Hive" mission, 4p. It drags forever and we were doing the same thing from the beginning to the end. We lost, but I did not feel the tension. Boring. Maybe other scenarios? Less people? Great miniatures though.

Edit. Rediscovered the game some years later, different groups and more mature gaming background. I started from the first mission, played 4p and then solo. Brilliant, I had a great time. The card management is very clever, also the possibility to interrupt locust movement. The mission built up the tension theoughout, and was never too easy. One misjudgement, going out of cover, and from full life you can end up dead. Rating increased, but I have still doubts on the variability for the future missions. Will see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
In hindsight, this game was probably ahead of its time when it came out. The cards as actions as well as life points plus the If-Then AI were more sophisticated than most dungeon crawlers out there. It still is. 

The hook is how the cards are used for their actions that must be taken in order. For example, attack then move three spaces or move up to three spaces then attack once, don’t move but attack twice, etc. You have to play the actions as per the order on the card. On the enemy AI’s turn, you can use a card for the symbol in the corner as opportunity fire or defense. When you take wounds, you must discard your precious cards. It’s a great system for the most part as it’s really fun to figure out how to play cards and which ones to save.

The problem is that the game can often devolve into a cycle of hopelessness. Your hand size is either six or seven yet you only draw two cards a turn. When a COG gets knocked out, someone has to discard a card to revive him. Then on his turn he’ll draw all of two cards. Frequently, he gets attacked again, loses all his cards and gets knocked out all over again. Someone has to discard a card to revive him, etc. When that happens, you may as well restart as it’s just not fun. All those fun cards decisions go out the window when your real hand size is two every turn.

An unfortunate aspect of this game is that FFG lost the GoW license and therefore no further expansions are forthcoming. The game could really use some new cards and scenarios, so it’s an unfortunate dead end in a way. If you’re a big GoW fan or simply love the game, you’ll want to scour the files section for the wealth of fan-made content that’s out there. I downloaded a fan-made scenario that was well worth it.

House rules to try:
1. COGs draw 1 card on each COG turn (instead of 2 on their turn)
2. Each COG may activate an ammo location
3. A COG may drop a grenade down a spawn point and auto close it w/o damage
4. Proxy a "Recover" card into the enemy AI deck
5. COGs draw 2 cards when revived

RATING: 9
This is an excellent miniatures, cooperative combat game for 1-4 players. Your team of COGs are trying to complete one of the provided missions (lifted directly from the 1st Gears video game). You have some default actions which you can perform by expending a card from your hand or you can perform the actions on the card. The drawback is that your hand of cards also represents your health. Too many actions and you'll be in for a world of hurt. Also, the enemy Locust activate after each COG, so, the more COGs, the more enemy activations before your next turn.

The AI is controlled by the monster deck. Unlike Castle Ravenloft there is a bit more variety here in the monster behavior.

This is one of my favorite games of 2011. I've played it both solo with 1 and 2 cogs (I prefer 2) and multiplayer with 4 people. I prefer solo (or maybe just 2 cogs).

A game that lasts a long time and is more or less exactly what you think it will be. If you love this style of game or the Gears of War universe then dive in. Anyone else will probably be left a little cold by it.

I like the co-op element of the game and the AI system for controlling the enemies without a GM. I like the hand of cards representing your health. I like how the board game is thematically linked to the video game.

On the downside, and perhaps this is more due to a personal preference than any fault in the game itself, I dislike the randomness. I'm starting to find, as I play more games, that I'm not a dice chucker. I also find that the AI cards can get caught in a bit of a loop and due to an unlucky roll or whatever you are set back significantly as more enemies spawn and you have to go at it all over again.

All of these negative points could be overcome, and I could go with the game telling a story, laughing at both the victory against the odds or the annihilation due to a mission that was suicidal, if the game was shorter. Giving up 2 to 3 hours to a random event is not that enjoyable. Some games have really grinded and others have been great fun but it does not seem that your tactics control which type of game you are going to be playing this time.

This is the game Castle Ravenloft was supposed to be!

Enemies controlled by AI cards allow each type of monster to be both unpredictable and different from one another. They also keep the game feeling less like a series of motions you simply go through (like in Castle Ravenloft) and more like an intense gunfight (get in cover!). Doesn't get much better "Risk/Reward-wise" than rushing an enemy and rolling a successful chainsaw kill with the Lancer.

Great (and HARD) co-op fun - and the rules are clean enough to have a new player wrap his head around the game in the first few turns on a scenario.

I could care less about the source material, but as a sci-fi "dungeon crawler" this game is pretty darn good.  The AI system is much improved over the simplistic system in the D&D games.  The whole mechanic of "your hand of cards is your hit points" is simply brilliant as it regulates you available options as you take wounds. The plastic minis are some of the best that FFG has ever produced.  The box feels a bit light on components so I hope there is an expansion in the works to keep it fresh.

I picked this up when I found out about the discontinuation.  

I'm an accidental fan now.

This is the most entertaining and cinematic dudes-in-a-corridor game I've played and has effectively inoculated me against anything else in the genre.

I mean, really, who needs Shadows of Brimstone or any of the other bajillion miniatures co-ops crowding the genre with shallow, busy rules and crappy miniatures? GoW is so much more efficient at getting to the meat of a dungeon crawl and looks better while doing so. 

There's no doom track, no ticking timer, no complicated item/monster spawning or convoluted AI, no decks telling you to draw from other decks, no "leveling up", town upgrades... all of those BS layers of pseudo-RPG kruft that give an illusion of anything more than incremental changes to how the dungeon crawl is really being played. The Gears of War recipe is somewhat simpler. It's just cycling through an AI deck, managing hands of action cards that double as hit points, using them to move, mow down monsters (basic attack vs defense dice with some procs), pick up loot (that actually allows you to measurably kick more ass), and triggering some scenario-specific rule tweaks or events. It works.

To anyone on the fence, I say grab it, even if the theme isn't completely to your liking. The rules are smooth and the scenarios are wonderfully staged and paced.  Yeah, the dice will screw you, but they usually do so in spectacular, somewhat satisfying ways. Fantastic game.

I seriously hope someone at FFG revives this system with a different license or in-house IP. It deserves to outlive the garbage designs that are crawling out of the Kickstarter woodwork.

I've found [thing=42776][/thing] more suitable for solitaire play then multiplayer.  The single mindedness of the monster AI (which mostly just rush you, but with some species variation) is very suitable for solitaire play.  The cooperative nature of the game and the seemingly pointlessness of "teamwork" interactions, which could be done just playing by yourself, makes this game more a solitaire game for me.

When played solo, controlling several characters, your choices become more tactical in nature, and this mitigates the somewhat chit-pull random nature of monster type activation.  The game is also very quick playing when you are playing by yourself.  

All the games I've played by myself has been very close affairs, either with the heroes dying near the end or winning.  Very tense.

Game is god damned great.  I appreciate that it is single minded---kill aliens, get to an objective, or die trying.  None of this chipping away HP style dungeon crawl or figuring out how to spread LOS into rooms or such nonsense.  Also, FFG spared nothing in the box.  It has a huge amount of content in it and reflects its GoW videogame theme perfectly.

Unfortunately, there are some "beta" elements to the system, especially the AI card system which encourages gamey behavior.  With a little more polish, this system would be unbeatable.  Even as a beta, it is still my favorite dungeon crawl.  I think it is the best Dudes in a Corridor game of all time.  They really need to reimplement the system in something that will sell a lot of copies so they can expand on it ad nauseum.

FINALLY announced! And it even has Horde mode! *fanboy squeeeeeel*

UPDATE 1 after 3 plays, rated 9: Wow, this is actually better than I expected. Hoping to get some more multiplayer games in soon. Great mechanics, beautiful components. Tons of fun, and excitement with every die roll. Close to a 10, but I want to play some more of the missions and with different number of players first.

UPDATE 2 after about 10 plays, still a 9. Keep playing with different people, so we've yet to progress beyond level 2. Everyone I play it with seems to love it though! And I'm definitely not tired of it yet. Still lots of monsters and missions to try. Also just noticed the release of the first POD expansion. Must buy!

UPDATE 3 after several more mostly solo plays. Still think this is awesome. Have yet to try/beat all the scenarios, and still some monsters I haven't seen in play. The variation in maps/monsters/weapons/player abilities and combination of these is absolutely fantastic.

At first I thought "another dungeon crawler, based on a franchise".  I was pleasantly surprised.

Fully cooperative: there's no DM, but maybe more importantly: this game doesn't have character progression.  So there's no use in getting more loot/exp/gold than your fellows.  This results in a game where each team member is a cog in a machine, and teamwork is vital.

The shtick of this game is that the evil Locust come running at you.  They're all deadly, and communicationg a cooperative strategy and/or taking defensive positions is key to good play.  This makes it feel different from the hack-and-slash feel of some other dungeon crawlers.

Negative point, but to be fair: this is a common complaint with all modern dungeon crawlers: lenght.

Quite a good game with streamlined mechanics and lots of tactical choices. The thing I don't like about Gears is the feeling of constant dread -- I'm sure this is by design but almost everything that happens in the game is negative. YMMV.

In a way, there is not much real innovation in Gears of War. The players do their stuff and then random things (dictated by card draw) happen. What it does however, it does really good. The AI on the cards work quite good and can put up some real challenge with tough decisions every turn and the game is not really hard to learn. The game feels more action filled than other games in the genre. Some scenarios may not be fully balanced, but is more so than e.g. Mansions of Madness and Descent.

Great game, full of tension and brutal combat and a surprisingly cunning enemy. It transcends the usual "explore map and kill things" through the use of cleverly designed AI cards that dictate how the enemy will respond. The random events don't disrupt the game's narrative, however, it all feels like a single, seamless adventure. Beautiful components and a sleek, efficient design make this a game that's possibly a step above Space Hulk and Earth Reborn.

Fun futuristic dungeon crawl.  Provides a good overall feel of the video game.  Lots of fun blowing away baddies or chopping them up if they get too close.  Rules are easy to grasp and it plays quick.

Hoping FFG pumps out more expansions.

One of the best AI systems out there and a great use of the IP. 
The game was as little bit too much on the hard side for my tastes, and the difficulty scales dramatically with more players.
Ideal with 2, 3 for overachievers, 4 for masochists.

GoW siempre me ha parecido un juego de cartas sobreproducido donde el tablero y las minis son simples adornos. El juego no está mal, es bastante competente en lo que hace, pero hay cosa que podían estar bastante mejor, el orden de turno que es fijo hace que no se puedan desarrollar buenas estrategias y la IA de los bichos es un poco tosca, todo hace pensar que es un juego pensado para uno o dos jugadores como mucho.

Fantasy Flight has solved every issue I had with Doom.  I love this game.   The miniatures, the tiles, the missions, set-up, and game-play are all improved over its predecessor.  It is as close to perfect as I've seen in this type of game, but there are minor things that could be improved which keeps my overall rating to a 9.

Buen juego tematico cooperativo muy cercano a la experiencia del videojuego. mencion especial al sistema segun el cual tu mano de cartas son tus acciones posibles y simultaneamente, tus puntos de vida. 

Algunas reglas lo hacen excesivamente dificil para los jugadores (mas bien "cheto" para "los locust"). esto se puede corregir con algunas reglas caseras.

Preliminary impressions suggest that there might not be much to recommend this over the recent D&D coops. The components are nicer and there are more options on your turn, but I'm not sure there are many more actual decisions to justify the increased rules overhead and playing time. 
I love the license, so I hope I'm wrong, but for now I prefer D&D and even Death Angel.
[EDIT] And indeed, I stand corrected. The improved AI is worth the extra complexity, and managing what to do with your Gears is quite engaging. A top-tier solo/coop game.
[EDIT] The AI enhancements that this game introduced have since been done with far more texture and nuance in other games. This is now a very crowded field, and Gears is a little too long and little too lacking in variety.

If only the theme would not make players I think would love this shy away. It's got great mechanisms, I love the AI cards, and the whole shooting and spawning and scenario-ing business was implemented quite flawlessly. I must admit that this one kind of fired Doom: The Boardgame for me (though I still also like that one). I've played this more solo than as co-op, but I like it both ways.

Eh a Corey K game that is correctly designed!
This game works like the D&D new boardgames should; the difference lies in the AI cards which feel much less dumb.
This is a nice co-op without the classical know it all player problem, partly because of the luck element.  
The rules are unusually clear for a FFG game, and the whole is quite simple and streamlined; unlike other CK/FFG games, there is no really cluncky part and every rule deserves to stay in the game.
The game is also true to the theme, but players who did not play the video game will enjoy it too.
Gears of War is a fine example of AT done right.

RATING: 3
Not a good game, it has the same appeal than a pc shooter.. wich, for me, is very little.

As a true co-op, killing hordes of monsters becomes repetitive very quickly.

Combat & components are all good, but after 1h you become aware of doing nothing than running up against a tough but rather simple AI.

The worst though is the action card system. Move one space & shoot, should be simple right? No, if you don't have the apropriate card you can't do it.. but hey look you could instead move 5 spaces.. Yay!
Why..? You're a trained super soldiers and you can't just do the most simplest thing..?
You know why it's in the game.. because it hampers your options.. and that makes the game more difficult.. otherwise you would realise much quicker that running up against a dungeon crawler AI is not really a lot of fun.

For what it is, the game length is too long.

It draws heavily on the computer game, so if you're a fan of it, that helps.

I'm torn between an 8 and a 9, with the fully co-operative gameplay pushing me toward a 9.  I really enjoy co-op games that offer an appropriate challenge, and this game fits that bill.

The gameplay is similar to Doom, if just a bit simpler.  Guns are all pretty similar in play, with just differences in range and damage dice to be rolled.  Unlike Doom, where different dice have different properties and each gun actually feels different.  Same goes for enemies, in GoW each enemy just has a different attack and defense dice number.  Sure, each gun and enemy has an ability when you roll an omen symbol, but the game feels simpler than Doom in this aspect.

The range is more picky than in Doom, which is a downside, and I don't really like the cover system.  Maybe I'm just detached from the theme because I've only played the original GoW on Xbox for about 30 minutes.

As for the health system, I'm torn on liking or disliking it.  On one hand, it is simple and elegant in that the more you try to accomplish, the more health you lose by spending cards.  Yet I also don't like if you have six cards in hand that don't allow you to move, and you really need to move, you don't get to draw any new cards and have to just discard one to move two areas.  With more gameplay and tactics, surely you could use the Follow action to mitigate this, but it is still a slight annoyance compared to the movement options of Doom.

I much prefer the ammunition aspect of this game to Doom, whereas you don't get penalized simply for rolling a particular die the wrong way.  The overkill shots are well implemented and make ammo feel more meaningful and less of a critical requirement.

Overall, the game is a lot of fun to play, and we fit a scenario in under 3 hours, which is nice compared to the usual 3-4 for Doom.  It also doesn't have the angst of Doom, where it's always one overlord versus all others.  There isn't as much tension in this game as it's much easier, but the full co-op in this type of game is very welcome.

A cooperative dungeon crawl with a couple really neat ideas. For starters the AI system works very well and doesn't feel overly taxing. This easy accounting means you have more time to actually play the game and focus on decision making. There is some meat to the game too - you need to understand your possible actions and make use of them all. That includes using support actions and making use of the cooperative abilities that are available to your characters.

GoW captures a lot of what I like about dungeon crawling games: collecting items, rolling dice, empowering rolls, hand management. I've always loved games like Doom, Unreal, and Quake and this hits the theme and feel on the nose. Here in particular you feel the constant onslaught of waves and waves of enemies and it's pretty satisfying to blow them up with rocket launchers and the like. It's not perfect - it runs a little long and can stall up if you start playing poorly, but overall it is extremely good and one I can recommend without reservations. 

Best with 1-2

Good game. Too long for what it is. a little repetitive, after 10+ games

Edit after more games: the game, no matter the mission, has a huge flaw: a single bad die roll will destroy your tactics. It has no strategy what so ever (you're just moving, tucking, shooting): all you have to decide is how many areas to move by... All the rest is dictated by dice. After 20+ games, and a Pod expansion, the game became stale.

I won't sell it, yet... But maybe... Who knows…

After 1 play ... I had a lot of fun and I look forward to playing again.  

The mechanics are some what similar to Castle Ravenloft and Wraith of Ashardalon (you perform actions for your character and then a card dictates the actions of the enemy).  The random tile layout is sort of similar but you build the map for Gear of War before you start.

Gears of War is similar in some ways but not the same, it seems more detailed then the D&D games.

OWNED SINCE 2011
A great game, and it has a different feel then other games with the same "military/tactical theme." It really feels like a first person video game and I like the way cards in your hand are used- very original. One of my complaints is that too often this game has one player giving orders or making all of the plans. Often what is suggested is the best thing, so it is followed. This makes it feel like there is one player making all of the decisions, and if your group is not talking and playing cooperative you will lose- the AI is difficult (in a fun and possible way). My other complaint is against the game mechanics. For some reason the locust phase feels like it interrupts the flow of the game. It does not transition very well and can take a be a bit too long to conclude.  I think the game will get better, and flow better, as my gaming group (my kids) get older. Still a nice game, and I love the constant feeling that at any moment things can get very difficult and we could be losing. Any time we do win, we feel like we barely did, and there was several crucial moments when we could of lost.

RATING: 8
In this cooperative game, every player takes control of 1 of 4 characters and have to work as a team in order of having success in every mission. This was the first cooperative game against the board that I really enjoyed and that I had real feeling of victory. Usually I do not really like defeating (or being defeated) an inanimated piece of cardboard, I prefer humans, but with this game is different, the mechanics are very good and it is actually really fun. I think that every time that I have played we have tried more than one scenario. 
The minis are very good, maybe this was one of the first games of this type that actually came with 28mm miniatures of good quality for every enemy. The cover and line of sight mechanics are also very interesting and work very well. The last mechanic that has to be taken into account and considered as a very good one, is the life/action/cards in hand mechanics: basically, your life are the cards that you have in your hand, those cards are used as well for doing actions. You only draw 2 cards at the beginning of YOUR turn, and this is the system that creates the big separation between the 2, 3 and 4 players game. After the player's turn, it takes place the activation of the IA. Then you can play cards from your hand to respond the enemies' actions. If you are playing with 2 players, you draw 2 cards, let's say that you have 4 cards in hand, that I think is the limit (I don't remember exactly), you play your turn (1 card), then, enemies' activation (they deal you a wound, -1 card), after the other player's turn, another activation (let's say that nothing happens, you are still with 2 cards), then is your turn and you draw another 2 cards for a total of 4. With 3 players you have to survive 2 extra enemies' activation, and with 4, 3 activations!!! Which makes the game insane. I do think that it really works fine with 2, being 3 the optimum combination of fun/difficulty
Positive:
1. Easy to play and explain
2. Cover and line of sight mechanic
3. Toughness increased depending on the number of players
4. Quality of the components
5. It is not that long, more than 1 scenario can be played during a single afternoon
Negative:
1. For 4 players the game is almost impossible (maybe an in-house rule should be applied)
2. The game is discontinued and I think that there are no plans of reprinting

When it comes to components it is truly outstanding. The game is just gorgeous and very functional. 

When it comes to playing the game is sometimes... frustrating. I played a few times with my brother and we lost every single time. It's not the lost that frustrated us that much - it was rather a complete lack of hope of winning. We just felt that we were screwed all the game long!

At the moment I am far from writing this game off and far from willing to try it again.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2012)

I’m a huge Gears of Wars fan so I really wanted to try this game. When I found the game was cooperative it was a bit of a letdown, I thought Gears of War was going to be like Doom, one player playing the COGs and another the Locust but the game is cooperative, which only bother me the tinniest bit. After all I love cooperative games :D.

The game has gorgeous miniatures, a huge plus for me. The art and components are great, except for the COGs miniatures, they look very similar so it is easy play with another COG. The game is more or less easy to learn and teach but I suspect that, like the videogame, the game has little replay value. Once you managed to do all the missions there is little incentive (to me) to get the game to the table and that is the main reason I´m downgrading its rating to a 6.5.

The gameplay is relatively short (shorter if the game kills you) and has a lot of luck with the dice and the IA cards, however you can plan and generally react to this kind of luck so it doesn’t bother me, some missions are really hard to beat. I also like the feel of the game, it is very similar to the videogame, including the same missions :thumbsup:.

I like to play it with 2 or 3 players, more than that and I begin to feel the downtime.

I won’t turn down a game of Gear of Wars but this is not a game I will request often. I DO want to finish the missions, so far we have been killed twice in the China Shop. I would like to own this game, mostly for the miniatures.

I recently played the game again :D and I continue to enjoy it. All my previous comments are still valid. I own the game but, nowadays, I have drifted away from Ameritrash games. In fact, if a game has great miniatures I suspect the gameplay won’t be good (like Blood Rage a game I dislike).

Gears of War can be played solo which is great for players who like that sort of thing (I don’t ever).

I (somewhat) dislike that weapons discarded are removed from the game, it doesn’t make thematic sense that you cannot share weapons if you are in the same space, but this is a minor dislike. I want to play again soon.

I dismissed this game so quickly after just reading the title but good friend sparked my interest. The miniatures look awesome, but the price is wow, it is quite a commitment. I am going to look around local stores to find a cheap copy.

Found a cheap copy for around $50(CAD), and I could not pass up on this offer. The components alone made up for the price. The miniatures are exceptionally well done except one of the miniature came with severed head - but nothing like a bit of superglue cannot fix. The map tiles and tokens are thick and sturdy. These are built to last; great job FFG!

When I first read through the rule books and watched few tutorial vids, I had my initial concerns with the game. First able, the game seemed way too repetitive. Yes, the map tiles, COG orders and locust AI cards all vary from each plays, but everything boils down to shoot and move. This might be dungeon crawl at its simplest form but I would have liked to see some sort of character development - if not, then full character customization in the beginning like LEVEL 7 OMEGA PROTOCOL. I wanted to see more variety of weapons and some special actions that make me stand out. Each character do come with special powers, but weirdly, they just felt short.

But after my first play-through...this game was really fun. I mean, the game is very simple yet it works. This is the sci-fi dungeon crawl that I wanted. Yes, if they added more meats into this game, then I would have loved it even better but as now, it is serviceable. Set up is quite quick once you have sorted out the cards, and it plays quickly. The fact that other player can also get to decide to follow you, or help you out with their order cards are huge plus in this game. The number of order cards in your hand determines your health was brilliantly designed. More exhausted you are, less options you are going to have. This game works for me :).

But if I have gotten this game for 80+ dollars that which I saw at local store, then I would have expected a bit more from this game than just pretty miniatures. More missions, more weapon types, special actions or what have you to give more depth to the game.

I need to play it few more times but right now I am placing it at solid 8 with possibility of rising to 8.5, but 9 would be pushing it. I cannot see myself playing this over other 9 rated games unless I specifically wanted to play dungeon crawls. Well, this one might be first one I tried out in board game, and works for me. I am ready to go down into dungeon crawl gaming starting with this one.

RATING: 7.5
Theme aside, as a co-op game, it's pretty darn good.  I feel the AI system is better than a lot of other games of this ilk (wish there were more AI cards though) in the way that players feel part of a team via specific order cards.

To be honest, I'm not a massive fan of the GoW theme.  It's not the worst thing in the world but pretty meh.  Now, if FFG took this game, adapted it, and created some form of co-op Descent (High fantasy setting) it would blow Castle Revenloft out of the water.

Still, recommended to those who like co-op games without the need of a GM-like player and is into their guns and/or GoW.

other user's comparisons to Raveloft et. al. are accurate.

The first dungeon crawler type game I have played and enjoyed. 

I haven't ever got into the story of Gears of war as I only ever played a few times but this game feels just like what I played.

The minis are great and the different types of enemies give this great replay-ability whilst also keeping it simple. I also love the action cards for the same reason, very simple yet effective, the whole game is just very streamlined which is great.

We played the second scenario and my rating went up by 0.5 so that is great, we defeated the berserker in Chinatown.

My 2nd favorite solo game ever.  Tense, fluid, fast and engaging.  I can't wait for an expansion.

RATING: 5
Some interesting ideas but feels undercooked.  The A.I. cards are a nice idea, but the deck cycles too quickly and once COGs are taken down, there is a potent death spiral because the A.I. keeps activating after the downed characters.  The COGs themselves are very fragile (they are essentially always one roll away from being downed) and carry almost no ammunition.  The Dodge card (+2 defense dice) is almost laughably inept (75% of the time it will be no better than keeping the card in hand to soak the attack).

Overall, some difficulty is, of course, a good thing, but it feels like Gears went too far.  That said, I managed to complete all six missions in the box so it certainly is a winnable game.

Gears does what it sets out to do and that, of course, is to capture the video game in a boardgame format. The AI is much better than the D&D games even though the idea was probably borrowed from those games. 

The hand management is where this game shines. You have to work with what you got and every wound you take or extra action is a thought provoker. "Do I risk discarding this card to grab a new weapon or activate the areas special ability or hang on to it because it's ability could come in real handy in future turns." 

Be aware there is a heavy amount of luck, from the dice to the cards. I have lost because of bad die rolls and because of the wrong AI card at the wrong time but each time I had fun.

This is the game I have been playing the most lately, mostly solo, and I'm enjoying the different scenarios. Each one has a different feel.

I can't resist responding to "Lowering The Bar" directly below me. Space hulk was this (at least 1st edition) Tense, brilliant AI (assuming your gaming partner is brilliant) A deck of cards will never be as good as an intelligent player. It had variable map boards and maybe not weapon cards but there was plenty of variety in the weapons. Sure GOW has a chainsaw but Hulk has lightning claws. Hulk was not meant to be a co-op, nor was it meant to be played solo. Kind of unfair to compare the 2 in that light.
Edit: Well he used to be right below me, he's now on the next page with an 8.5 rating.

RATING: 7
Its a streamlined squad-based game in the vein of Doom, Space Hulk or Claustrophobia. The system (apart from the map building) is quite straightforward and easy to learn. And while I appreciate how simple the game is, its also lacking in variety.

Everything comes down to black dice and red dice -- and who rolls better. There are no real tactics, and the "cover" system made famous by the video game seems tacked-on. Also the LOS rules are badly implemented in this game. I wouldn't mind an occasional game of this, but it definitely would not be a top-pick for me.

This isn't enough of an advance from other, similar dungeoncrawls like Claustrophobia or Doom, while adding a bit of overhead in setup. The rules are not well structured. It's not a bad game, but it's undistinguished enough that all things considered I'd much rather play something else.

Based on the Gears of War Xbox games, this feels like a first person shooter. Up to four players work as a team to accomplish a mission. Each mission has predefined board pieces that are randomly assembled and a predefined set of enemies. Mission objectives change throughout the game as each is accomplished. Enemies spawn, move, and attack via actions as drawn from a special deck of cards. Heroes also use special deck of cards to determine the sort of actions available each turn. This is a fun game that presents a real challenge, but does not include a lot of depth.

To echo the sentiments of others, it's often too long for what it is. A scenario can take several hours, and you're basically doing the same thing two hours in that you were doing at the beginning.

The first two scenarios (Emergence and China Shop) are the most fun. Hive and Belly of the Beast just drag, especially with more players.

The gameplay is a lot of fun for a while, but it tends to overstay its welcome.

Great game! Its almost just like gears of war 2 the video game everything is the same. The main COGS are in it (some COGS from the video game are not in the board game. The main locust (some locust from the video game are not in the board game). I hope that if an expansion comes out they will add some more characters.
Pros: great game overall, lots of weopons that they added and cool rules that make the game unique.
Cons: some things are missing compared to the video game but they will probably add things with expansions.

Well the first introduction game was fun.
The second game was clearly broken. (rating 1 according to BGG scale)
Why was it broken ?
Because we weren't under a lot of pressure to open the door to the third level.
Two of us were down but if we didn't open the door only a few other locust would spawn giving us the time to heal up again.
We should have been killed and overrun. Instead the game turned into a drag.
If we played by the correct rules I rerate it and give it a 1 for that reason. Certainly for that difficulty level.
The cover rule is excellent and the omens and hits work well too.
The simplification of the rules on the wounds was also clever. No endless adjustments with counters but just one counter.
I don't know if it was in te rulebook. but the minis should come with a picture in the rulebook and the name.
The picture on the event cards and the locust cards varied.

RATING: 8
First of all I have to say: this game looks great, it feels great and it plays great.

The system is nice and there is a high difficulty and pressure while playing. And even if this game is a dice fest it has many interesting tactical decisions to be made all the time.

The models are just great looking and cry for being painted.

I never played the Xbox game (I am a PS guy ^^) but it seems that everything is dripping with theme of the virtual original.


But maybe this deep borrowing from an action computer game leads to my biggest complaint about the game.

I miss the depth and atmosphere of character development and RPG elements and I miss some cusomization options. Therefore you don't feel very connected to your characters. You can find new weapons but you don't have a lot of time to use them because if you play a new mission you start again by scratch. There is a little flavour text on the mission cards but in the end the game feels like much action less story.
This may be an unfair complaint because as far as I know the video game is a true action game and the board game is just living up to its legacy.
But I would have loved to see some campaign rules and RPG elements. You have to come up with something like this by yourself if you feel the need for it like I did. And of course there is enough room to create house rules for those missing pieces, I would have just loved them out of the box.

Reading about how the game plays sounds too simple but playing it yourself soon launches your adrenalin high up and you realize this is more of a perfected stream of brutality were each fight draws you closer to the theme running from cover to cover merely surviving and hoping your injured team mate will help before you bleed out.

Its streamlined, its thematic to an excess with way above standard production quality and the best board game to simulate a cover shooter ever made.

Take the AI driven games that Wizards made (Ravenloft and Ashardalon) and amp them up. 

The game maintains the simplicity while adding difficulty and several new mechanics like cover and range to the formula. The entire "level" is built and populated making the experience more intense as the whole board marches toward you. I also like the idea of the quadruple use command cards, that work roughly like the Command and Colors system; Your hand is your life total, how you use special actions, how you perform regular actions, and perform reactions.

Corey continues to be a designer to watch. OH, and did I mention the BEAUTIFUL bits and the wonderful art on the cards and tiles?

This game is what Space Hulk should have been! Tense, tactical combat with an effective and diabolical AI system, character and weapon attribute cards plus variable map boards that makes each game exciting and unique. It's works extremely well as a solo game, but shines with more players because of the cooperative aspect of the game play. I enjoy playing solo with 2 characters, too. 

The game includes beautiful components that truly capture the feel of the video game. One of my best purchase of the year. Cannot wait for expansions!

PS: This game can be brutally unforgiving if a series of tough ai cards are drawn in succession, and it can become tiresome as a result. Strategy goes out the window when three cards in a row send every enemy on the board towards your COGs, ending in a slaughter!

Love this game and the tension that it brings throughout the entire session. It's a pity it only plays up to 4, so it doesn't always come out with a bigger group. It's very easy to go from seemingly dominating to utterly losing and vice versa. Matches the feel of the video game quite well and the scenarios are pulled straight from the games. 

The one downside is the gaming of the spawn system. Leaving out one of an enemy type and just running away from it means that more of that enemy type will be hard pressed to get out onto the board. There are general events and such that can get them out, but they are rarer. Still, even by abusing this you may only win a session with 1 or 2 players left standing, or still utterly fail.

Edited my score of this from an 8 to a 7.5. This game is easy to learn and easy to teach, but the problems are such: setup can take too long for the ease of the game. Also, for some reason people keep getting AP with this game. This is not a game for AP. You have limited options and there is usually an obvious best option available. People need to stop thinking about it and just do it! The game just drags on too long for what it is when people have to stop and think about their moves for a few minutes. Anything over an hour and a half on the easier scenarios makes the game boring instead of the exciting, easy game it is.

RATING: 9
Very thematic. The only way I could love this more is if there was some tactical positioning involved.

Is it perfect?  No, but it still holds a special spot in my collection.

If I could only have one coop game, this would be it.

Strong hand management element to the game.  You have to carefully balance how you want to use the cards since they can be used several different ways, but they're also your life points.  

Only real negative is that sometimes the game can take too long (3+ hours), which can get a bit tiring since it may start to feel a bit same-y.  There's a lot of threats being thrown at you and you will feel like you're not making any progress.  Horde mode can be a nice compromise.  Set a time limit and if you're still alive after time is up, then you pack it up, if people are ready to move on. 

Update after 30 plays:
Downgraded rating from 10 to 9.  May still be a tad inflated, but it's hard to discount all of the fun I had with this in the past.

My initial comments above are still accurate.  Can be a bit same-y, long, difficult.  Love the hand management.

Keeping my fingers crossed that someone runs with the basic idea of this game (stand alone missions/horde mode/dungeon crawler/cards as life) and fleshes it out more.  How great would this be if you could customize your characters, their weapons, abilities.  Maybe even give them their own deck of cards to make each character feel unique.  I know, I know - it sounds like I'm almost describing Fireteam Zero, but it's lacking something.  Maybe the monsters in FTZ didn't feel as dynamic as the GoW monsters.

I wish I was the one who came up with the game mechanics of Gears of War: The Board Game. It's just a terrific game design and I can already foresee future expansions fitting into this game. The downside is that the game only support 7 missions and the replay value is a little low (yes, you can replay the missions over and over, but why do that when you know that the story and monsters for each game will be the same). I hope the game sells well enough so that Fantasy Flight Games will push out expansions to support this great game. Now, if only fans of Gears of War will come up with their own scenarios and maps...

I've played the first scenario 3 times now and can't beat it. I like the cards-as-wounds mechanic, and the game really does feel like an FPS, but it seems too hard.

That said, I'm determined at some point to win a game, but right now I only pull it out every couple of months.

Update: Finally beat the first scenario! The line of sight rules are what was throwing me off --- I was assuming the little white diamond pointers on the tiles indicated that the LoS bar rotated 90 degrees differently from what they actually indicate.

RATING: 3
Gears is difficult and unforgiving, which is fine, but it can also run much too long and it gets monotonous. Maybe later missions improve variety, but it's hard to see how it would ever come close to the D&D Adventure series. And later missions appear to be longer, compounding the first problem even if they do solve the second. While cards give you perhaps more options than, say, Ashardalon's character powers, those options generally boil down to little more than move/attack.

The first mission is a great example: Roll badly on grenades and you'll spend the whole map fighting newly spawned versions of the same three enemies while you run around like an idiot getting more grenades until enough goes wrong. Our second play on that mission (and second failure) ran two hours before we called it for bedtime; we likely had another hour to go. Three fucking hours? No.

It's amazing how closely it models the video game without feeling contrived (though knowing the video game isn't essential to enjoying it). Some bits work like other co-op dungeon crawlers, but it has a unique rhythm and some clever mechanics that make it stand out. Most notable is the "hand = health and actions" thing, which is just brilliant. Cards are incredibly precious...but so are defense dice, and new weapons and ammo, and shooting enemies before they can act, and...

Cover is well implemented and suitably important, the filthy Locust are deadly, and the whole thing hangs together well. The rulebook is intimidatingly long but it's mostly examples and the rules are quite clear. The bits, of course, are fantastic.

Sadly, two plays with little obvious hope of improvement in problem areas on the horizon takes the luster off this pearl. It's not fun yet and I don't particularly care to find out if it gets fun later. Got rid of it.

Surprisingly good video game license - I don't even like the video game - nicely tactical and co-operative, feels like a bunker-blitzing war movie at times. Longer missions can drag, especially if you retread the same ground and some are a real grind with the full 4 players.

Le jeu réussit très bien à reproduire certains aspects du système de jeu du jeu vidéo. Dans ce dernier, si on reste à couvert on regagne de la vie mais on n'agit peu et si on agit en sortant de son couvert on perd de la vie sous le feu ennemi. Dans le jeu de plateau si on agit peu on gagne des cartes cad de la vie et si on agit beaucoup on en perd.
Très difficile. Semble plus difficile à plus de joueurs (notre tour revient plus rarement donc on complète plus rarement sa main de cartes mais pourtant on en perd tout aussi régulièrement car les adversaires sont plus nombreux et agissent à chaque tour de jeu d'un joueur) => utiliser variante (cf. fiche du jeu)

RATING: 8
Looking at the theme and reading the rules it is completely logical to think the game is the lowest form of a dungeon crawl aimed at IP.  Playing the game is thankfully, delightfully, entirely different.  Playing a FPS on the screen has a fast tension that is punctuated by moments of personal heroism and amazingly by some mechanical alchemy that translates to cardboard.  Long shots feel like long shots, an uncanny roll doesn't feel like luck but like a head shot, and all the while the game keeps the players hunkered down and on the edge.  The screen implementation of Gears specifically trades on teamwork, and even that translates to the game with an incredibly clever use of followon and interrupt actions that players can use in conjunction with one another to make for what can only be described as "team combos".  The mechanics are solid, play is tense, tactics are clever, and fun is plentiful. I did't expect to like the game... but now consider me a fan.

If there are any quibbles they come from the length of the campaign.  Sure it does take you through the story of the game.  Sure it introduces all the unique unit types.  Past that don't expect anything grand and do expect to rely on player content or else choose to enjoy what little you have in the box.

It was just an okay game. I don't care for the Gears of War videogame franchise, and nothing about this board game version threatened to change my opinion.

It didn't seem to do anything particularly well or uniquely. And I didn't find anything about it that made it stand out in my mind.

I would probably play it if someone asked. But I can think of so many other AT-themed games that look better, work better, play better and are just flat out more fun.

Good game. But too long and too much of a grind. I played 4 times, and it took at least 2 hours each time to get from one side of the hallway to the other. I think I prefer more wide-open gameplay. In GOW, you basically have to hide, move, hide, move, hide, move, attack.

[u]23-Jan-2013[/u]:  I don't have many plays of this at the time of this writing, but this game is pretty awesome.  I feel like it's a boardgame version of Space Hulk: Death Angel (yes, I know there is an actual Space Hulk boardgame, but I've never played it).

It's a cooperative game where you control a number of soldiers fighting off the evil creatures to complete your mission.  Lots of cards, sweet miniatures, several tokens, and a bunch of map pieces you put together randomly to create the board.  Lots of variety and challenge with this game.  I look forward to experiencing more of this game...and probably increasing my rating after more time with this one.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  Dang, this game is awesome!  I finally got in some more plays and even tried the second scenario out.  This is a tough, thematic, miniatures boardgame that I always look forward to playing.  Because of the time and space it takes, I haven't been able to play as often as I would like.  

The card system for both the player(s) and the AI works great.  So many options for the player.  Strategy and tactics come in to play every game.  And that "Aliens" storyline is just so much fun to me.

So good.  Really.  Just so, so good.

*Sept 2014* I just realized I've played this game an astounding 15 times. I love this game, the only reason I haven't rated it is because I haven't finished all the scenarios yet. I need to see its full replayability prior to rating it, as longevity is factored in.

Having said that, it's definitely worth buying just to play through once. Got it back in March or April and I still love it a ton!

Great marriage of theme and game mechanics. Co-op really shines through and the locust AI system is REALLY hard to win against. When you barely pull out a win against certain death the following turn I guarantee there will be genuine high fives all-around. The miniatures are very very nice and look even better painted.

Fantastically thematic. Strong narrative current. For a co-op, it managed to avoid quarterbacking. It seems like FFG borrowed elements from Doom/Descent, but managed to update much of the game play so that things were streamlined and focused and players could focus on tactics and successful completion of mission rather than the metagame of loot. I would definitely say yes to future games of this.

Very good co-op miniature board game with simple to learn mechanics.  It does an excellent job capturing the feel of the video game.  One interesting facet is the use of cover and map features that provide cover or restrict movement but do not impinge on line of site (walls that don't go all the way to the ceiling, lofts, rubble, desks, etc).

A solid tactical scifi co-op. Wonderfully mimic all that's great about GoW XBOX experience, in a tabletop format. I'm a fan of the AI design: let's hope it'll show up in other games, too.

Unfortunately, what worked in a videogame thanks to the visuals and the story, shows how cheap the game is at its core: move, take cover, shoot, repeat. Exalting for the first times (thanks to FFG's over the top quality), then an ok experience, and quite boring after a while.

Still, there are a lot of wonderfully working bits in it, it's a great coop dungeoncrawler with a bit of hand management and tactical reasonings.

Was pretty excited to play this originally as people said this was an upgrade from zombicide with its AI deck for monster actions.

I have never played the video game, making my opinion of this game as a board game unbiased.

Seems to play well enough, and I love the "AI" deck idea which makes a miniatures game that plays against all the players- no Overlord required.

However, dice and card draws decide the outcome all too easily, as sometimes you will get the cards to storm ahead and win, whilst other times the dice coupled with certain AI draws will have everyone bleeding out in a turn.

Don't like the discarding cards life system, its too easy to run out and there's not enough ways to get cards back.

An ok game, maybe you can get more out of it if you like the video game.

This has been great so far solo. I'm looking forward to trying it with others as I want the board to be busier and to have more interesting options on movement/cover each turn. Saying that, if others don't like it, I'll happily play this all the way through solo as the dynamic is great and the progression of your character within a 'level' is far more interesting than Fire Team Zero. This feels like 'action' FTZ felt like a puzzle.

RATING: 8.5
After 4th play.  Same thoughts as listed below for 2nd play except, it can be shorter than 3 hours, we played a game in 90 minutes (and won!).  I enjoy this game quite a bit, since I've played the video game quite a bit.  I think it is a GREAT port of a video game to a board game.  I don't know how it would go over for players not familiar with the video game.

After 2nd play, a mixed range of feelings:
1) It does take 3 hours and can feel long and repetetive at times.
2) It is a dice fest, and Luck can work for you and against you.
3) This makes for many exciting and nail biting fights.
4) Yet it is a tactical game and your decisions DO matter.
5) Just as in the video game, you need to stick together, get in cover, work together, and don't try to rush the enemy. "Otherwise", you lose!
6) This game is tough, yet fun.  I will come back to fight another day.

*************

After first partial play, I can say that the game does a great job of recreating the video game feel, and is fun.  I think people that have played the video game will get more enjoyment out of this than those that haven't (much role playing fun to be had :)  I give it a tentative rating of 8, may go up to a 9, anxious to play some more.  First game with my son took a little longer than I would have liked, because of rules and setup, but once it started everything flowed smoothly.  

*************

Yes, it's Ameritrash with dice, but it is fun, with a superb theme (at least in my book).  Every once in a while you need to break away from the straight laced and stiff Euros.

If you are not willing to spend the somewhat hefty price ($45+), I highly recommend Space Hulk: Death Angel ($20).  Which gives you 80% of the same feel at a fraction of the cost, and plays quicker.

*************

I'm a BIG fan of the video game.  Cautiously optimistic about the board game.  Taking a wait & see attitude right now, till we see some more pics and rules.  This may turn into a MUST buy for me :)

Really enjoying this.  Never properly played the video game on the eggs box (being a PS3 man myself) but had a fiddle with it, and it seems to capture the theme well.  The minis and tiles are brilliant and the artwork and design is classic FFG (ace), but with less of the foibles and clutter that usually populate FFG games.  A great cooperative little shooter game which amps up the pressure as you go along.  We're gradually making our way through all of the missions and having a great time with it.

I really like this game as a video game player because it does create an experience that matches the theme pretty well.  There are some rules that seem odd to me, but they do not take away from the overall gameplay.  The biggest downfall for me is the amount of time needed to play a single mission.  This is where this game falls short and games like the D&D Adventure System get it right.  Hope they eventually create more expansions though I find it unlikely given how long the game has gone without one.

Co-op dungeon-crawler with minis, based on the video game. I bought this to play solo and was not disappointed. There are a few finicky rules, but overall once you learn the basic game it flows very smoothly from turn to turn, and the enemy AI system is excellent. It's very challenging (I have yet to win a game), but the experience is fantastic. 

If you do play it solo, definitely play it with two characters, as the cards that allow for character interaction really add to the strategy.

I wish this had had a longer shelf-life with more expansions, but I'm glad I got my hands on a copy.

RATING: 9
An excellent design that also captures the feel of its source material surprisingly well. The card management mechanics work really well, as do the AI cards.

To really love this game (which I do), you kind of have to embrace the fact that you're going to lose a reasonable amount of the time. The difficulty can be pretty brutal, and most of the time cautious gameplay is rewarded and rash, impulsive moves are punished with a swift end to the game. (Some people I've played with felt they were a bit too locked down by the difficulty – they wanted to be able to perform heroics without being savagely beaten down.)

In the end, the 'Gears of War' setting is the weakest thing about the game, since it's such a colourless, derivative world.

I have never played the video game nor do I have any interest to in the future. I however enjoy playing cooperative shooters in video games and this board game fits that bill for me. The board game AI is very tough and smartly designed in this game and was my main draw to it. Unfortunately, the game can be extremely tough and luck dependent. I feel like one bad roll could determine the game so I always play with house rules.

I would recommend this game but not how it is intended with the rules as written.

Awesome, awesome game.  Never played the video game, but watched enough of it on YouTube to get the theme.  The board game version is an amazing translation and the randomized map and enemy AI keeps this game amazingly fresh.  The difficulty and replayability is also perfectly scoped...  Didn't pass third mission (Belly of the Beast) until the 12th attempt - losing was even enjoyable.  Really, really enjoying this one - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  In fact, not sure how this didn't get more praise when originally released.  I am glad I stumbled onto this gem and expect to be playing it a lot for a long time.

I have finally gotten around to playing this with others and it is great fun. 

If you enjoyed games like heroquest or Dragonstrike (i.e. Dungeon crawlers), then this is the game for you. If you didn't like those for the setting, try this one anyway. If you hate coop or sci-fi, don't try it.

This is the most fun I have ever had playing a coop game and is the most truly cooperative and not just a committee game or an alpha nerd (one guy tells everyone what to do all the time). 

Also, the minis are very high quality (GW level). They are so Nice I am going to paint them and if you knew how much I hated painting mini's you'd be impressed.

Brilliant co-op with myriad options on a given player's turn. Little downtime is expected in multiplayer as you've got to pay attention for chances to follow or op fire. A touch too fiddly with all the decks upon decks and tokens upon tokens. I suspect lighter solo fare will come out more often, but when this one does it's a beast. It's Mutant Chronicles with a solo option and hand management.

Wow, this game continues to impress with the further on scenarios. Games are usually very tight, leaning toward the "difficult" side of the spectrum. It's thematic and yet mechanically very tight and, dare I say, elegant.

The downtime is actually a bit annoying with 4 but not bad under that.

This is one tough nut to crack. Its been 18 plays and we're only managed to beat 2 scenarios. Sure it has been several groups but still its pretty tough. Mechanics are nice and relly easy to teach. Geting to grips about how to handle diffrent situations are not. It gets easier and easier if you play one scenario over and over and finaly it will seem like easy one, but so far every new scenario has been like brick-wall that you need to bang a few time to see where the cracks are and then just smash those in. Still, I want to play it, it has very good tension and most endings will come down to wire - can we make it or no. Having Hammer of Dawn ready and then getin your ass kicked is a bit dampening but the rush while your throwing those dice and revealing the AI cards somehow makes up for it. And we were all very happy after that berserker did us in :p
Bonus points if you have played the videogame as the situations and scenarios bring back the memories from the time you wailed on locust with with friend, hands sweating on the controller.

Lots of setup, arranging maps, baddies and events for a given scenario and then your own characters and weapons. Followed by a dice-rolling combat fest, moving forward through the map, blasting baddies as fast as possible before they get you. A turn is to draw 2 cards, then action one of them (typically) to do its listed actions, be it attacks, moves or specials. Then draw a card from the baddie deck which will tell you if or what moves and/or attacks. So some turns are safe, others are horrible bloodbaths - it's certainly dramatic. Take cover where you can as that gives you extra defense dice ... and every wound you take you lose a card. If you take a wound with no cards left, you're dying and someone needs to rescue you by sacrificing yet another card, which makes them more vulnerable ... and before you know it there's a vicious circle going on, everybody's dead and it's sayonara. I'm not sure how much I like it yet. There are decisions to be made on how you spend your precious cards, but it feels a bit repetitive. Nonetheless you've got to admire how true it is to its design goal. The good news is that's there's lot of scenarios to explore and that lends itself automatically to replay and getting money's worth.

Based on one play: It is nice to not require a dungeon master, this way everyone plays against the system in this dungeon crawler. It has a lot of aspects that are pulled straight from the video game, which will please fans of the video game (like me). you can cover, follow and it is non stop action as new enemies come out of the holes until you close them up. One cool aspects is that your cards in hand are also your life points, so you can perform a lot of actions in between turns, but since you only draw two cards a turn, you have to be careful since you also lose them when hit. As with other dungeon games of the genre, it is a little repetitive, but I only played one of the basic scenarios. I am sure I will play again soon.

The miniatures are some of the best sculpts I had ever seen for a board game.  This game is just like the video game, Very brutal.  Out of the 3 games I played, won twice (barely both times) and lost right at the end once.  Cover is important and so is teamwork.  I can not stress this enough.  The other components are top quality and for a FFG very easy to store...for a change.  I do give this an Honest review of 8.  Make sure you put the AI cards in card protecters, they will be used ALOT.

RATING: 8
Great co-op, and the hands of cards make it difficult for other people to tell you what to do. Cool scenarios, impressive difficulty, and numerous tough decisions every single turn. The figures look good (not great) and the board areas are almost adequately made, which is phenomenal for a FFG game. Cover mechanics sync perfectly with the videogame, and are much more fun because you're not staring at a brown slab of stone. The weapon drop mechanics are really spot on as well. Could definitely use more enemy types, though.

Wow, I can't believe I almost didn't buy this game due to the negative reviewers. 

I can't understand how someone could prefer the Dungeons and Dragons co-op board games over this. This game is SO much better than those. 

You don't need to be a fan of the theme or even know much about gears of war to enjoy this game.

Works great as a solo game, but also has great teamwork and co-op elements. multiple ways to use your cards. There is actual depth and strategy in this game. Some real and meaningful decision making in comparison to it's competitors. The AI system works and flows nicely.  Plenty of variability and scenario diversity provides game play variation. Challenging. Fun. light medium to medium weight game. Another good design from Corey.

This game is either an 8 or 9 for me. More plays needed to see where it ultimately falls. It's an 8 for now but could go up.

I only played through 3 time's on the beginner solo mission but I have to say,Great Game! All the figure's the Board,Dice,Rule Book,Even the box is great. Every time I played through it was different and it kept it real close with the AI card's,But I have to say I havent won yet. I think a lot of people complained that it was to hard and being impossible to win,but I think if I did a few thing's differently I could have won,But time will tell in my future play through's. The rule book is beautiful,but I think it's kinda backward's. They don't tell you enough in the beginning of the book,you almost have to start from the back. But it's all in there you just have to bounce around in the rule book for the first couple of plays. Other then those few thing's I didn't like the game played really well and worked out nice with every move keeping it a nail biter. Overall I think the game is great and recommend it. Hopefully we will see some expansion's in the future making this game really take off!

I am not a fan of the theme. I don't like Gears of War, and I hardly like sci-fi (compared to fantasy themes, I mean). Despite this, I love this game. It is a great dungeon crawler. Rules are simple to teach, and it encourages real co-operation and teamwork. As I am sure you have lot of co-op games can degrade into one person taking over and playing 5 roles, but I have yet to see this here because the basic strategy and rules are so simple to grasp. I love the game, and the length is great for small groups. The is a lot of variation, and the games works very well as a system to bring in loads of home rules/scenarios. Really excellent game, even if you don't have an interest in the theme.

Update: it has been a while since I had the opportunity to play this again. I simply do not like the card driven opponent. One member of the group plays so often he had a very good idea of what would happen next each turn. It is ok for a few plays but then it is too similar to play an AI in a video game - learn the system and the game is beatable.


Update: Having played Dritzzt (sp), Gears has fallen from our regular play list. There is simply much more varsity in the actual gameplay than what is found in GoW. Wizards has produced a simpler and better system.


This is a derivative of Doom and as with each new iteration, the system improves. I especially enjoy that it is now completely co-op. The one problem I had with the Doom/Descent system is the DM position...it simply isn't much fun. Claustrophobia improved on the system slightly, giving the DM a larger role but the real fun is in the challenge of making it through. With that in mind, it is critical that the AI reacts properly and retaining a real challenge. It does. This is challenging and fun.

This game has some nice team-mechanics and is nicely fastpaced even with more players. There could perhaps be more exploring in the game but it is not a problem.
But this game is hard. And when I say hard I mean HARD. Like comparable to the actual Gears of Wars' Insanity difficulty. I very much expect that we will never get a win in this game. This too, however, isn't a problem as it gives our group a nice challenge.

As a gamer, I've definitely changed and now an Ameritrash game needs to not be all the same.

That is fine and it definitely holds true to the video game...but it didn't excite me really

RATING: 8
Better than I expected. I prefer it over similar games like Descent or Castle Ravenloft. The mechanics are much smoother than those games, setup is faster and it's easier to teach to new players. The rulebook could've used some more editing or bullet points for quick reference, but it's not overly convoluted.

My only real complaint would be the length of the game. The firs scenario took us nearly 3 hours to complete due to bad random placement of the tiles. (Needed grenades to close holes + 1st tile was the only source for grenades = lots of backtracking)

Simple choices, lots of d6s thrown. Too long on bigger maps with not enough strategy but the mechanics are elegant. That said, the order deck is weak in execution. There are basically three cards in it worth having and almost everything else is suboptimal fodder for interrupts.

Bull in a China Shop as the second mission is a crime. It goes from Tutorial to Puzzle Gimmick without giving you a straight up shootout. In fact, most of the scenarios are just irritating in one way or another. Tickers in the dark, doubling back across a huge map, I don't want this tedious crap. Just throw map tiles and plastic aliens down and let us get to point B... which, given the map tile randomizer cards among other things, is actually extremely easy to do. Making your own missions is simple.

Not a great game, but fun. Plus, you don't have to paint the locust minis because they all come with the exact color scheme from the game.


... that's a joke.

Have played 18 solo games in Emergence Day mission (3 wins with Marcus, 3 with Dominique, 3 with Augustus and 3 with Baird). So far no two battles against the Locust have been the same. Amazing game. It doesn't take long to learn the rules and, although a mission does take at least an hour to complete, often going beyond two hours, such a tactically engaging game couldn't take less than that (IMO). High quality components, highly detailed miniatures, deep gameplay.
Played once with a group of strangers. It does take a while to explain the basic rules, but to play tactically, you gotta explain all of them, and the details. So it might be a good idea to tone down the difficulty early in the session and gradually strengthen the Locust. But we all had fun and managed to win the Emergence mission (two bleeding).
Just finished my first solo China Shop (with Fenix), and the game has just revealed a whole new level of depth to me: the Berserker chasing you every time you fire a weapon, not enough grenades to seal the holes! Amazing game.
China Shop solo score with Fenix: 2, Locust 0. I guess I'm much better at the game now, and with Fenix's +1 life/Order, and his better chance at the Chainsaw, the mission seemed easier than Emergence Day. Now with Dom, things are dire: 1 victory, 6 defeats. One less life does make difference, not being able to chainsaw your enemies and thus having to spend the Gnasher's ammo token to effectively kill your enemies is a serious disadvantage.

Have enjoyed my few solitaire plays so far. The game seems to easily penalize poor play. My one victory could have been a loss based on a couple of tense die rolls.

I like the modular & random setup. The AI card seem to provide nice variety, though I imagine with time it may be easy to predict AI behavior as each "species" of enemy only has 4 specific AI cards.

There seems to be a lot of tactical variety possible with different availabilities of weapons, order cards, Locust AI cards, and room configurations.

Looking forward to playing this more.

From a design standpoint, GoW is one of the best dungeoncrawlers out there. Simplified areas, understandable cover rules, special effect results with the dice, combat cards which give you different options, and using cards as your life. While the gameplay has fired the original DOOM and gives me no incentive to feel I need another dungeoncrawler, GoW isn't *that* good that I would recommend tracking down a copy and paying OOP prices. I do hope FFG uses the mechanics in another setting. It's certainly far better than Descent, Massive Darkness, and other dice-chucking dungeoncrawlers.

This game took a while to get the rules down (invested about an hour in getting to know them all), but once they are learned, this game is tough to beat if you are looking for a great co-op experience.

I asked for this for christmas for the sole purpose of teaming up with my little brother for a game, as we usually get into heated arguments in competitive board and card games.  

Once the rules are learned, the gameplay is fast, frantic and requires team work and strategy.  I am looking forward to playing this again tonight.

Everything an adaptation of the video game should be: fast and furious; ported missions and clean streamlined flow of play (to help evangelize video-game fans). On the design front, Mr. Konieczka is his usual original self, introducing a modular AI, a fun map-building mechanism to allow for different experiences with each mission, staged missions, order cards as health, and a less conducive environment for bossypants syndrome in a cooperative game.

On the negative front, the rulebook is full of poorly worded ambiguity and mistakes, and fails to cover several situations. The gameplay can also get a little repetitive on the longer missions. And I'm familiar with all the Order Cards now; more variety would have helped.

RATING: 10
A very good game with well thought out combat system and enemy AI. Plenty of replay ability for solo play and great fun for up to three players in multiplayer mode. Four players would require some dedicated individuals that really can work well together and concentrate on the game.

Gears of War is proof that a single play is not necessarily all you need to determine whether a game is good or not.
Your first game will be atmospheric and exude chaotic carnage with its card draws and dice rolls keeping you on edge.
However you will need to discover ways to mitigate the random factors in the game, which requires you to become familiar with the rules and situations that arise.
This will only happen if you play multiple games but I can understand why some people do not want to invest that much effort.
You do need to run two COGs so that interactive cards are useful and more tactical options are available.

Fan made content is available for extra COGs, Locusts and missions (most of it is excellent).
There are some commendable house rules available that make the game less random and avoid some perceived weaknesses, if you feel too overwhelmed.
Kurt has a good article in his [listitem=5810625]Play Tracker Geeklist: Gears of War[/listitem] that lists some of the popular rule changes.

A great game that keeps giving, after many years of play! :thumbsup: 

I don't really have anything bad to say about the game!

The components are good. The plastic used in the figures is a vast improvement over the crap found in FFG games usually. COG figures could have looked more like their video game counterparts. The game mechanic is solid and has taken a lot of stuff from the console franchise. My only problem is that pure co-ops never really work for me in board games, and I was just plain bored while playing.

Exactly what I've hoped for: Not as bloated and as fiddly as others of Corey's games (e.g. Mansions of Madness). Quick gameplay and streamlined rules without having to manage a ton of components, similar to the Dungeons & Dragons Adventure System Cooperative Games (Castle Ravenloft/Wrath of Ashardalon/The Legend of Drizzt), but with more tactical decisions to be made. I think this is one of the best games Corey designed (besides Runewars).

(Minor) Cons:
- If you kill all enemies of a kind, they will immediately respawn, so better keep one alive (this is just wrong thematically)
- Unlucky draws from the AI deck coupled with a few bad die rolls can quickly finish you off
- Overkill attacks feel almost always necessary, even against the weaker enemies
- Too much luck required to seal emergence holes (house-rule: discard grenade in same space for guaranteed seal)
- The player characters only differ in one special ability
- Similar molds used for the player figures make them difficult to distinguish
- Gameplay is strongly focused on combat without offering much diversity

If you have played the video games I think you will actually have an easier time grasping the rules of the game.  The theme has been captured perfectly.  Making progress, getting overrun, falling back to take a breather... it's all here.  I'm really happy with this one and it saddens me that there won't be any expansions for it beyond the first pnp mission pack.  This game truly deserved better.  Great co-op game.

I was really impressed with this game, I bought it because I enjoyed the video (the first one, not the sequels) and it turned out to be the best dungeon crawler I've played. It feels like the game was created as a toolbox for recreating scenarios from the video game, which is exemplified by the fact all that was needed to expand the game was a set of a few dozen cards.

The game is fully cooperative, with the enemies controlled using AI cards that react to the situation on the table. Once you learn the AI cards a bit more, there are tons of tactical choices in this game, usually about positioning yourself in such a way that you won't get hit by the enemies during the next activation phase.

The only wish I have is that there was a campaign mode of some sort. I understand the GoW franchise is not rooted in any RPG system but it would be great to develop your characters at least a bit. Still, I'd recommend this game to all fans of the video game and to most people who don't like or don't care about video games but love dungeon crawlers.

I absolutely love this game. I wasn't expecting much from it truth be told, I only got it because I'm such a huge fan of the Xbox 360 games. So imagine my surprise when I actually played it and found out it didn't suck!!! No, in fact it's awesome and captures the 'spirit' of the games perfectly.

I dunno... I find it hard to get excited over full cooperative gameplay, but this game feels pretty old-school, I like it... only played one scenario so far. It's pretty hard to judge scenario based games without more plays so it gets the conservative rating treatment for now.

i wish i liked this more.  It has a tremendous AI, so good for solo play, and very smooth play.  But it gets a little tedious when new baddies keep spawning.  I'm not sure i like solo and co-op games, since the game is usually designed to be hard.

Provisional rating after one four player game using the first scenario.

I had my doubts about this game as I'm not a huge fan of this genre of board game (Doom, Descent etc) but as a fan of Gears of War, the game turned out to be much more fun than I would have expected. A good translation from video game to board that recreated the tension and desperation well.

Very good game! I do hope that eventually get's reskined. Only negative aspect would be that in longer missions game tends do become a bit of a drag. If you play cautiously, game tends to last and last for hours, if you rush, you will probably die. I would not recommend playing more than 1 mission per session.

So far played only solo.

There are lots of co-op games, but this one feels unique. Most of the games focus more on character development and less on actual strategies. I love how this play focuses more on strategic play and less on characters. The characters feel different due to the variety of their abilities. Having tried all 4, felt like every game in solo play required different strategy.
The game is pretty difficult, especially in the beginings before players get used to the unique mechanics. But I found out that co-op games I win 99.99% of time and the only time I lose is due to "bad luck" are not for me, I want a challenge in games and this one provides it.
The gameplay itself is fairly strategic, limited options of stuff you can do makes you think harder about your choices and plan your moves carefully. Gives you a unique play each time and keeps you engaged, thinking on your feet, which appeals to me. The game also counts with drafting cards having a random element, so there are two ways to use a card, either to play action listed on it, or it gives one attack or two movement. Which perfectly balances some "unlucky" draws of cards, since you always have the possibility to do what you need (even though the "default" abilities of cards are a bit hindered, but gets you out of a tight spot, which serves it's purpose well enough).

The AI and enemies are tough, there are some luck factors in die rolls, but overall you know what you're getting into with enemies and you know they'll keep comming and you have limited ammunition, so it adds to strategic planning. Do I try to kill this guy or just run for it? Keeps you on your toes.

Overall a very unique co-op with lots of interesting mechanincs and very engaging gameplay. The only downside is the small amount of missions. The length didn't bother me since I didn't have a feeling of doing the same thing over and over again, each gameplay felt different so far.

A great game if you like medium weight tactical combat in kind of fps style in a board game. And even though it's based on a video game, there's no need to know it. The story (since it's an fps) is almost non-existent and the board game itself reminded me more of fallout tactical combat than the fps "father" of this board game. And I loved fallout's tactical combat.

Edit: After some playes in group of 4 I'm even more excited. At first it seemed the dice are a bit too decisive element in the game, but we figured out since then a lot of ways to mitigate that. I mean you can't predict what AI will do or what you roll on dice even though you have like an 80% chance to pass, you may roll terribly. But once you figure out all those little tactical nuances, the game becomes more and more a tactical play and luck factor is really nothing that can beat you down very often. Somehow it feels like having bad luck at Pandemic. It can happen, but more often than not you are able to mitigate it.
Love this game even more. I'm sure it will hit the table more often now. Though the game length is somewhat limiting, but still, everyone I played it with enjoys it greatly. Worth the money.

Edit2: After few more plays with various player numbers, it's even better for me. But I prefer to play with 1 or 4 players. With 2 the game seems to lack a bit on co-op tactical aspect, with 3 it's better, but best with all 4. With 4 the game really shines, all characters work awesomely together and it's starting to get a huge tactical feel to plan carefully few moves ahead (usually the whole round, roughly of course, you have no idea what may interfere with your plans). Lovely game. And solo it's just like a one great puzzle you have to solve. Although it's not that frantic as in 4, it's really great as solo play. Love it.

This is the first game in the last 20 years, that comes close to my all time favourite Space Hulk! While it is certainly different regarding its gameplay, I liked it very much, that the rules are easy to understand and that the designer realized that tactic is not necessarily a function of highly complicated rules, but the result of a balanced game structure. Thank you very much Mr. Koniezca!
It has a very intuitive game mechanic, that creates this flow which only few games possess. What also impressed me is the card driven AI. Really a joy to play.

Rec'd Mar 20, 2012. FFG still can't figure out how to write a concise rulebook, and this one has the usual "refer to page X for the rest of the info you need to understand this particular rule here." But the components are great, having solo play as an option is great for me, and the rules make sense after slogging through a couple plays.

4th game - 'The Hive' - torture, reptitative, over long, no arc. Game sold
---------------------------------------
I need to play more than one game to make my mind up. I like the card play/reaction/follow/health use. I don't like the set up - at least its no as fiddly as Mansions on Madness. not convinced by the AI either, but need to play more. So far I think i prefer Ravenloft/Ashardalon as they are easier out of the box. 

--------------------------------------------------------

2nd game Belly of the Beast solitaire and its looking like Ravenloft/Ashardalon is winning by a couple of points. There is just a bit too much set up and fiddliness in 'Gears' for the amount of game play, the scenarios don't seem to offer much real variety and steer you through the game like the 70s solitaire dungeon books. I don't dislike it (i really do dislike the scripting of Mansions of Madness), it just not going to get a lot of solitaire action.

Minis are gorgeous and production top notch 

------------------------------------------------
Having watched the FF Video its piqued my interest

Looks a little like a co-op Descent with a splash of Castle Ravenloft and a pinch of Mansions of Madness. It does not look as fiddly as the latter, looks more involved than Ravenloft and as ever with FF top notch production.

Paid double the price for a new copy due to out of print status and likely to never be printed in the Gears of war license again. 

I got a bargain. This is a surprisingly thoughtful tactical shooter. Hand management, defensive cover, teamwork and a cunning AI deck. Only negative is that there is not more content (official) around. 

Scenarios have a variable set up so there is some uncertainty and there's fan made scenarios around the geek.

The kind of game that puts the trash into ameritrash.
This so not my kind of game.  Really feels like a pimped up version of Zombies!!! to me.
The theme, board, characters and monsters are bland and so is the game play which can be summed up with dice rolling, dice rolling and more dice rolling.
The choices aren't compelling, the coop element is weak and the AI cards are uninspired.
The kind of game that makes me stay off Fantasy Flight games.

I enjoyed this somewhat, but it has a lot of problems.

Pros- It is pretty.  It is thematically sound.  It is fun to kill things.

Cons - The AI system is flawed, in that clearing bad guys is always met with spawning them.  There's no sense of gradual achievement, because killing something just causes something to spawn.  The cards as health idea does not seem sound.  The rulebook borders on atrocious.  Too many little exceptions for a game that is fundamentally medium weight.

Not recommended unless you love dungeon crawlers.

Picked up a 'damaged stock' copy from IGUK with a small dent in the bottom. Much better than some reviewers had suggested, this is a tense enjoyable game that works well as a solo. The game tension build nicely with some moments of brief respite before the action builds again. Got this for cheaper than the vg, and will get much more from it.

Feb 2013
Now ten plays in and love it more each time I play it. There are some truly epic missions in there like Belly Of The Beast, and I've had some sessions that are so good they feel like stories worth telling. Just a really great fast action tactical game, the best of this genre by some margin.

Jan 2016
Still the best game in my collection. The AI and the health being hand count keep this exciting for me. There are occasions when you need to make a call, but nothing that detracts from how far in this game takes me. When to push forward, when to back off and try and heal up, this all matters. The game works because it doesn't feel like solving a puzzle - it feels like being in the action, which is why I enjoy this more than MK.

Brilliant game. The order cards are well thought out, you have to think what you are going to use, but rarely stuck with nothing useful. The weapons and ammo use is a great feature. The AI is very good and plays a tough game without just overwhelming you with numbers.

Atmospheric and immersive, tense action and involving strategic thinking. I love it solo, I love it coop.

The figures are so detailed I want to at least dry brush them when I get time. The COGs though NEED some paint to make them distinguishable, and (minor point) why isn't the one who starts with a shotgun holding one instead of a Lancer?

Just finished playing the China Shop mission with Gears of War music in the background.  Good times.  This was my fifth game and I am liking it more and more with each play.  I need more missions!

After a few more plays I started to lose interest in the game.  The missions started feeling very samey, I felt the cover mechanic slowed the game down, the dice rolling is too important for a game that go long, and ultimately I didn't care for my hand of cards dictating what actions I can take.  When I see a big, ugly thing and I want to shoot it I don't like my cards saying I can't.

I much prefer an action point allowance system.  I have Shadows of Brimstone coming so we will see how that game is.

GoW is a good game it just wasn't one for me.

Being a massive fan of the series, I can say they did a stellar job of porting the mechanics from the video game to a board game format, everything just feels right. Anyone who's played and loved the video game will feel right at home here.

This game is...... awesome! I've only played it solo so far but as a single player game it bests all others in my collection. Its very atmospheric (i play it with the GOW sound track on in the background which also helps!) and gameplay is really interesting, fun and challenging. Board looks great. As with all great games, I find myself getting really sucked into the experience represented on the table and there is a real sense of fighting for survival in a clostophobic place against clever, dangerous opponents. Pretty clever for a board game! Much better than the video game as well!!

RATING: 6
As co-operative games go, this is pretty good if you're prepared to overlook many of it's shortcomings.  It is, however, brutally difficult.  That coupled with the frustratingly long setup time (about 30 mins) and in-concise rules, makes this a game that you really need to be in the right frame of mind to play.  If you've played the Gears of War video game then you'll immediately notice a good job has been done on replicating the theme and when you win a game, it's incredibly satisfying.  Losing a game however can often feel like it's out of your hands and you're merely at the whim of luck.

You can play a perfect game strategically, and have dice rolls on your side, only to be undermined by a series of unlucky event card draws, which will completely overwhelm and end the game.  I think the game is at its most balanced with 2 players and at its most difficult with 4 players.

I really like the system of using your hand of cards as your hit points.  This forces you to make decisions on whether to use cards or to keep them.  The decisions are always crucial because poor hand management will leave you dead. I would have rated this a little higher except for one card that creates a spawn point in your location.  If there aren't any monsters on the board, it can come up more often than is comfortable.

1/8/12 -- As shooter, Ameritrashy board games go, this one scores high points for me. I like its streamlined play. I don't usually give high marks for this type of game. I'm almost a pure Euro gamer. But thing about the way the cards work with the decisions works well.

Perhaps the biggest point of conversation/controversy with this game is the use of each players' hand of cards as his health too. I like it. And to me, it makes thematic sense. When you take actions--regular or special--you're expending energy, which easily translates to spent health to me. It works well for me. Additionally, I like that the game is on the easier side. If I'm going to take the time to set this baby up and give it a play, I want to feel like I'm slaying and not getting slayed. That's just me though, I suppose I like feeling in control with my games--again, I'm a Euro guy.

The essence of a dungeon crawler and monster bash. Still one of the best AI implementations in board games I know. Good variability in setup, but the setup does take some time. Very interesting hand-as-life concept and the command cards really build up the characters of your COGs. Good miniatures and board tiles and lots of theme in it.

This game is too reliant upon card draws to really even be playable. Tying health to your hand is a terrible, terrible, terrible mechanic. Gets a 4 for production value only. Luckily I got cheap and can reuse the miniatures.

Gears of War is a very good Dungeon Crawler that feature true coop gameplay and lots of tactics while not getting to heavy on dice. What hurts the game is that there is no real campaign and that all characters play basically the same. Each has his special ability, but this is not enough the really distinguish them from another.

First Impression:
A thematic "dungeon crawler" set in the popular "post-apocalyptic" gears of war universe. Well produced and even better presented it seems like a typical luck fest with some interesting twists.

I only played half a game (we got mowed pretty quick thanks to the owner insisting not to play the introductory scenario) but it was fairly interesting. Both hand management and bullet management were fun, and the game was full of theme so I was ok.

I'm not the biggest fun of dungeon crawlers but I'd try this game again.

First: I'm not a fan (nor disliked, just don't know it) of the [b]video-game[/b], so this is purely based on the board game. This information my help.

Now, about the game: it is a [b]great co-op[/b]. There is - and is required in order to have any chance of winning - an enormous necessity of real cooperation of the players.

The [b]game play[/b] is streamlined - cards for everything (health, actions and weapons) and not too many bits (the ammo tokens, for example, is the same for every weapon - except the bolo granade, that don't really use ammo after all). The line of sight (LOS) is the rule that I have the most difficult to teach, but with the use of the board and the minis, I learned that is one of those things that it is easier to see than it is to teach.

The [b]minis[/b] are top-notch, with many details. But the COG minis are difficult to tell one apart of the others (the only that stand out is the one for Augustus Cole, that is throwing a granade) - so stickers or paiting is a must for them. The locusts minis are easy to be separated.

The [b]replayability[/b] is huge, even if the characters don't change, because not only there is several missions and the set up for them is random (the tiles are the same, but the way they are conected changes, so the overall map can be very different and the same for the way/strategy to complete the missions).

It is not without flaws: I don't like that a player be almost of the game when he is [b]bleeding out[/b] - I would rather have some penalties for the character, like loosing a die or don't being able to use the Order cards for their abilities (just for the three basic actions). Sure, it should be make a note that the character is "injured" or "bleeding" (maybe if the character cards have one face for the Normal and other for the Bleeding Out) and if everyone was in this condition then the mission failed. However, the option for bleeding out is better than a player elimination option any day of the week.

As of right now is my [b]second favorite cooperative game[/b] ([b]Arkham Horror[/b] is the first, if you are curious and to shed some light about my likes in games).

This game is way too light in a tactical aspect. We got dice rolls, random action card draws and random event reactions. There's hardly anything in the game, that you really got control over. All that luck driven randomness mixed with a long playtime really makes me a sad little boy. 

Basically this game is as ameritrash as it gets.

It should also be mentioned that the game has its share of serious print and text errors. The dodgy written rulebook also makes this game way more complex to learn than it ought to be.

Played twice solo and one 3p game with the kids. They understood it perfectly and made their own decisions. We had a blast. :)

Udate (still a 9): Have played more solo games and a couple of two player games. This game can be harsh if you're not careful. But it's still your own fault, so it doesn't feel unfair. Still very fun though.

I enjoy the mechanisms for the game but it can really drag sometimes.  Once you're low on cards it's really hard to climb back into the game and the choice between only 2 cards isn't nearly as interesting as having a full hand.  Looking forward to Fireteam Zero and hoping it fixes all the little things that hold this one back.

I generally like the games that FFG produces. It just turns out that I am not a big fan of the games created by Corey. Most of his games offer something new, and they all make use of some clever cardplay mechanic, but to me they tend to be either too slow (Warrior Knights), too fiddly (Death Angel) or too unbalanced (Runewars). Gears Of Wars falls into the first category. With tree players, it took us half an hour to get from one room (tile) to the next, because new monsters kept spawning and running at us. So halfway through the game I felt like I was doing an endurance test. Too bad, because I like how the game looks and also how it has very little downtime. As it stands, I'd much rather play Doom.

Superb game, tense and exciting! I love the multi-level maps with their delayed exploration, the varied missions, the teamwork between characters....

Scales wonderfully for solo play. Replayability looks good too thanks to variable map production, let alone the expansions I'm sure will come. Really, really enjoying this one!

RATING: 7
One of my first designer board games. It was purchased because of the theme alone, which it exudes. This is an amazing adaptation of a video game.

The rules are a bit of a slog, but the mechanisms shine anyway. The multi-use order cards are genius - they are your health, actions, and reactions! Expending your hand to take out a threat is a rewarding stress. The AI deck is also well-designed to keep up the pressure of the game.

Multiple plays pre-BGG tracking. Now fully painted!

RATING: 8
quite fun and challenging; more straightforward than at first glance; spectacularly well written rule book -- everything well ordered and explained in detail with relevant examples immediately beside the discussed rule; extremely nice components; interested in trying out the solo mode more, and then introducing some house rules/created scenarios in the future to spice it up a bit from time to time; the game seems solid for when you need a smooth hit of shoot'em up tactical play for an evening -- the mechanics don't bog it down (at least in solo mode); fun and variable set up of board scenarios keep it interesting

Provisional rating, one play.  Enjoyed it, though the scenario (Hive) was too long and too repetitive.

After many enjoyable plays I've decided to part ways with Gears. An excellent solo game and a solid co-op that actually requires you to work together. However, I just had too many games that lasted too long for the fun that they were.
---------------------------------------------------------
This rating is for both cooperative and solo play. Gears is a game that emphasizes combat and tactics. It isn't as deep as a minis game but is tense and full of small but meaningful decisions. You get excited about nailing that long range shot and moan when your dodge fails.

The game can go a bit long for the time it is fun but that is often the result of cautious play as much as the game itself. I have yet to finish a game without wondering where the time went because I was enjoying myself so much.

The randomness level is too high for my taste. My first solo game, I failed the first mission horribly because 2 different grenades failed to seal the emergence hole and the grenade pickup was on the other side of the map. I don't mind challenging as long as there's something I can learn from it, but the only things I figured out that would've helped were roll better and hope the map is more conducive to picking up grenades quickly if you don't. Not exactly encouraging.

Having said that, it doesn't have the alpha dog problem that most co-ops do, which was very welcome, and I love the cards as health system. The AI is also pretty good (though not perfect). I just wish I felt like I had more control.

As true to the console games as a board game could get. Very fleshed out sets of bad guys & weapons, excellent production quality.
Difficulty ramps up a bit too fast with more players, but can easily be docked with a simple house-rule or two.
Rules overall are brilliant for the strategic depth they get, without becoming too complex.

This game has mostly been replaced for me by the recent DOOM Board Game but I still have to give Gears of War props.

It manages to be pretty clever in it's implementation of concepts from the video game franchise into a cooperative board game experience. Nasty aliens are popping up across the board, just waiting to tear your face off and it's up to you to put them in their place.

Killing a Boomer might result in him dropping his weapon...and you want that weapon! But to get it means running right up into a swarm of nasties. But you've got your teammates to back you up! You'll really want to coordinate with them if you want a decent chance of survival. Hot-dogging it in this game will probably get you curb-stomped.

I like how many of the cards have multiple uses. You can use them for their action, save them for their reaction ability, or even just discard them to take a basic action you don't have in your hand. I like how your hand-size doubles as your health. So you can take a whole bunch of actions on your turn...but then you leave yourself open to getting taken down.

I'd like to make some homebrews to DOOM using some of the mechanisms from Gears to create my own fully co-op variant. Because the only thing more fun than shooting demons in the face is doing it with your friends!

Rip and tear!...er, sorry. Wrong game.

Perfectamente ambientado en su temática, las fases son iguales a las de los videojuegos. Se juega igual que en la consola: siempre cubriendo y siempre atacando de primero, porque si te despistas te hacen una escabechina.

[i]Gears of War[/i] has a character flaw.  It's either too light or too long - take your pick.  Adding a good dose of rules, while keeping the length the same, would increase my desire to play again. As would shortening the game and keeping the gameplay in its original feather-light state.

But GoW does have its honorable mentions.  I like the cards = health mechanic, and GoW's ammo/weapons system is a clear improvement over the system in Doom.

I'm also impressed with the small map, but it does have issues.  The forward momentum of the GoW "plot" is tightly constrained, since physically there's not much wiggle room for attacking or squad advancement.  Each player, in turn, can only move and act as far as the walls and exits allow.

The severe lack of flavor text in GoW is also a problem. Ostentatious descriptions of mutated walls, half-rusted machinery, and gaping monster mouths are half the fun in alien-based coop games. Doom has GoW soundly beat in this critical area.

That game is very enjoyable. The rules are short, easy to learn and explained through many examples. Random setup, choice of characters, card activated ennemies and a solo mode make replayability a true positive asset and the stronger asset of the game. Tiles and tokens are on par with other Fantasy Flight products, cards are a bit on the thin side. Pre-assembled figurines are well detailed but made of a soft plastic (probably designed to prevent damage inside the box while shipped). They could be painted.
I bought it to have a solitaire game but my first experience was 2-player. We loved the few games to date.

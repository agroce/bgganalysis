Could well be my new all-time favourite. 2 plays so far and absolutely love it, especially as I now have a better appreciation of how the game works. Still unsure on the dice roll element but the pure economic nature of the game is fantastic. A very deep thinking game and yes, it does have some Analysis Paralysis but it just feels so pure a strategy game. The game is actually rather simple but it just seems so complex on first apperances but it really should be given an opportunity to shine. As someone else stated, this is possibly a hidden gem but it's a fantastic game. Perhaps not worth the RRP price but if you can pick it up cheaply it's surely a must-have.

Wonderful economic game, what I had hoped Wealth of Nations to be like, very dynamic market, seems very scale-able to different player numbers. 

The market can be completely different each game just from subtle differences in production.

Kind of burned out on it though, quite geared towards players who know what they are doing and the first turn seems very important that the auction really needs to be valued correctly or someone can shoot off in to an early lead.

Lots of interesting mechanics that yield an excellent combination.  Lots of choices to make and they're all significant.  The market and market manipulation aspects are well-implemented and absolutely integral to the game.  Production value (first edition, LudoArt) is excellent.  I wish the box/board were smaller and/or folded more.  I *LOVE* the theme and artwork!  (Yay steampunk!)

Unlike [GAMEID=32666], the playing area is much more forgiving since it is dynamic.  Upgrades can be moved around between tanks.  The energy coupler changes location.  (We disallow actual tank movement among platforms for 2 and 3-player games, and allow it for 4 and 5-player games.)  The lack of trading among players makes for a faster game with faster turns and less downtime.  Also unlike [GAMEID=32666], the market is much less forgiving.  Sell or buy at the wrong time or in the wrong quantity and you could very well be in trouble.

But that's what makes this game so much fun!  You have a lot of choices to make and the game is very unforgiving.  There's a learning curve at work and you have a lot to figure out.  Other players' choices will certainly affect your own, so the game itself is very dynamic.  No two plays will be quite the same.  Not as punishing as some other games, but very sharp.

I never played M.U.L.E. so no comparison will be forthcoming.

After a number of plays (6), I'm starting to better appreciate the depth of play.  The game is built up over a number of turns (years) and every game is different.  Some games prices skyrocket and sit there a while, other games one or more prices tank and don't recover.  Some games enough tanks are produced to meet demand, other games 1 or more years pass without any available tanks for purchase.  Since this is a game of perfect information, it depends [i]entirely[/i] on the actions of the players.

Quite often the game is won or lost incrementally.  Sometimes you can look back and pinpoint a bad decision that cost you credits.  Other times, there's no singular decision to pinpoint.  The game is comprised of dozens of smaller decisions that build up over time to form a singular outcome.  While choosing role X over role Y in year Z can make/cost you an amount of credits, it's far more likely that your position is dependent on your earlier plays.  There is a clear sense of development at work and every decision matters.

Rating bumped from 9 to 10 (4/29/09).  My 6th game went horribly awry.  We had 2 years without [i]any[/i] tanks available for purchase.  End scores were low (550-700ish for a 4-player game).  The market was very volatile and no good peaked higher than 12 (and only 1 good peaked higher than 10 before the final round).  Very tight game.  It's refreshing to play my 6th game of this and still be seeing new things.  I want to play this more.  Definitely a 10 for me.

Excellent economic simulation, second only (in that regard) to the incomparable Container. Very, very little luck involved and I can't imagine any two games being alike. While the theme is pretty light, the mechanics nevertheless tie in quite nicely; and the art and components are just gorgeous! Even the rule-book is a work of art in that everything is explained clearly and concisely. 

My only complaint of note is game length: Planet Steam is just a tad too long for what it offers.

Only played with two, but it's a reasonably interesting market manipulation game. The rules are (predictably) sort of a mess. However, even with two players there had been an impressive amount of movement in the markets and everything.

Seed goods will gradually come into offer as the bonus resource (making the role auctions more interesting even if the competition for the roles might not be particularly fierce). And then the gradual ebb and flow of the various markets to theoretically open and close the various avenues of the game.

Like any auction game, it feels that much of the economic dynamism depends upon reasonably valuing the goods on offer. And, also balancing what you're buying against the value of having the cash on hand. E.g., claiming a territory should theoretically be worth at least $25 (for the end game value plus it being land that you can mine), but you need the money for all the various bits of infrastructure in the game (buying resources and converters and etc.). So, in this sense, it feels a bit like Power Grid where you need to budget for several rounds of spending. But Power Grid dumps so much money and so many resources into the game that eventually the budget part gets diminished. In Planet Steam the money and resources are sort of managed by the market and the various means of automatic production (tanks, namely). This makes the market and economy in Planet Steam a bit more interesting and interactive, but I still think I prefer Power Grid for the more interesting map part and a nice feel of escalation and fluidity of play.

RATING: 7
Planet Steam has three key elements:  characters with special abilities, who also determine turn order; the production and storage of four resources; a dynamic market in which players compete to buy low and sell high. Those elements interrelate to create tough decisions and punish poor planning.  Planet Steam is highly interactive, with an auction, land grabs and that market, where turn order can be critical.  

It's odd perhaps that the one doubt in my mind about such a dynamic and interactive game concerns variability.  The board play, in particular, feels fairly obvious - claim plots on the river, get orthogonally linked claims, limit competitors' space for expansion.  For me it remains to be seen whether the other elements bring enough variation to keep the game interesting.  

I own the FFG edition.  Everything about the production, from the board to the plastic tanks and cards is really well made.   The artwork could perhaps have been a bit more alien and more Steampunky.  The rules suffer from the usual FFG bloat and poor organisation, but at least they seem complete.

Nice pure economic game. I don't care much for the steam-punk theme but the game works nicely. I love the market system that follows the rules of supply and demand. Prices go up and down based on what the players are actually doing. Money is tight at first so be careful on the opening moves. I also liked the components (we played the FFG version)

Unlike Age of Steam, Power Grid, or other vaguely-related games I didn't walk away liking one side and hating another.  The economic system IS the game, and I think it works great.  The best supply and demand implementation I've seen by a landslide, with the next closest being Container.

Expensive, but beautiful bits.  Probably won't be produced in the US due to the component cost.  Costs about 120-129 at online stores.

The box size is ridiculous.  How much better it would have been to have been available in a square Kosmos size box.  Could easily have been achieved with an extra fold in the board.  I guess the size is to mask the huge price tag, which possibly is required because of the inspired wooden pieces.  Nice graphics, quality presentation, just way too big.

The game is a nice design.  The market is clever.  Maybe too clever as it becomes a bit fiddly.  The game encourages AP in those subject to it.

A very dry game as with many economic games.  I prefer something a bit lighter, hence the average rating.

This game officially replaces Power Grid as the best game to simulate supply and demand.  Sheer brilliance and excellence in mechanics.

This is a very smart game but has a pretty steep learning curve.  I imagine with more plays my rating will go up, but for now the game is too large and long to warrant wanting to play all the time.  

It is an awesome game, though.

RATING: 9.2
The steam punk theme seems a bit of a tac on, but the actual game is full of challenging and subtle choices in resource management. Quite heavy but very satisfying as a gaming experience.

Update: The more times I have played this game the more it has gently revealed its underlying qualities. Few actions carry no consequence and you must be observant of every other player to read the direction the the four resource markets will take. Turn order has a major bearing on your buy/sell positions as prices are fluctuating throughout the year phase. You can go from cock of the roost to feather duster simply for failing to foresee a resource becoming scare and ramping up in price, or conversely, a glut of production driving the price down to valueless while you're still holding a bucket-load!
My only regret is that this game really works well with 3-5 experienced players and can prove a brutal experience for the newbie. That reservation apart I think this is a brilliant economic game and a visual treat to play.

Rating after one play.  It's a brain burner, and I think being played by a bunch of new folks, we had a bit of group think that changed the flow of the game.  I honestly felt like I was losing the whole game, but ended up making some good decisions at the end of the game to catch up (and ended up winning).  It was difficult to understand when to start switching over, and really seemed to end just as you got your engine running (or actually a little before).

Managed to table this and it took us less than 2 hours for our first play which was not too bad. At first I was afraid it would really take 3 hours.

The first round was the longest as we went through each of the phases step by step with guidance from the rule book. Surprisingly, this game had not been covered by most of the major reviewers. So I research what I could but still tried to follow the rule book to get the first round right.

After the first round, things starts to move faster as players got used to what they are suppose to do and how much to auction. We seemed to be so hard pressed to get cash. The market tanked really fast with the energy and ore depleting really fast to provide for new tanks. Not sure if we are playing correctly but the market prices seemed to react slower as it takes a full round for the market prices to rise up by 4 notches when it hit 0 quantity.

Looking forward to getting this out more often to get a better understanding of the game.

Takes Power Grid to another level, adding more realistic market manipulation of resources. However, it never gives you the satisfaction of running a well-oiled machine before the game is over. Every little mistake can make or break your game, not forgiving at all! But I love it and want to develop better strategies.

The timing of the market was tough for me to predict.  I found it odd that sometimes prices would go up after a sale!  The board positioning for the shafts was uninteresting.  Perhaps the die rolling was intended to add some excitement.  It failed.

Update:  The market is easier to predict in a 3-player game.  First round bidding may be the most important decision in the game.  I really hate the components.

OK I admit it, I bought this mainly because I fell in love with the look of it. A game that looks this good could play that well right?

Wrong. First play down and I am stunned by the flow and subtlety of this epic mind stretch. OK so I came last, really didn't grip any sort of strategy until game end and certainly was waking up to oportunities a turn after they had passed. 

Predicting the prices on the stock exchange, developing your resources and juggling that with player position to maximise profit is exquisite torture.

Simply awesome.

Second play and I must flag up a caution. Beware, this game is a brain burner and some players will relish the opportunity for excessive AP. No joke a 4 player game with 3 newbies (& only my second game) took 4.5 hours!!!! And that was with me nagging like an old woman. This game must be played with a timer under these circumstances.

However still an awesome game.

This amazingly looking game really could have been about anything. In it's heart it's a game where you have to manipulate the market and the turn order to the best of your ability. There is only money to be generated if you create the opportunities yourself. The gameplay is ok but has way too much fluff added to it. Further development could have resulted in a great game. Now it's just an ok game which looks great.

I enjoyed the art work on this one.  The tanks were unweildly, but they look pretty dang good on the board.  The rules were very clear and I'm pretty sure we did not make any mistakes while playing.  The gameplay itsself was great.  Very tight money.  Very tight.  We went into it not knowing how to value stuff in the auction (two player game) but after the first round, amazingly, we had $$ left.  You wanted to do more than what you could and it really felt like every part of the game was important and every good was important but total success was jussssst out of reach.  I'm really looking forward to playing this with more than two.  I feel the rating will move up.  One of my geekbuddies said it reminded him of Age of Steam in regards to how tight and brutal the game can be and I have to agree with him.  I think the second game we will do something with the market to vary it up each round...I believe that would make it pretty exciting.

So, yeah, tight money game, excellent look ahead, great look.  :)

Okay economic game.  Stock market manipulation and timing of production are major elements of the game, and money can get pretty tight after the first year or two.  Turn order is also very important since the timing of buying and selling in the resource market is critical (sometimes it's best to be first and other times best to be last).  The components are nice, but the wooden attachments don't stay on the "tanks" very well and the price is steep and the box is unnecessarily HUGE.

Notes to self:  Seems like the best way to start is by taking water as your bonus resource and to try to go 1st or 2nd for the cheapest tanks.  For some reason, my thick skull cannot comprehend the fact that bonus resources only get re-stocked if that resource exists in the supply area (i.e. if the market has ZERO quartz, there will be no bonus quartz during the auction phase of the following round).  Remember that almost all of the energy and ore in the market gets burned up between rounds in order to make tanks for the next round... so none will come out as a bonus resource.

UPDATE 2011: I think the resource market is a bit too fiddly and weird for my liking... and it exaggerates the importance of turn order.

relatively heavyweight brain burner type financial game, with choices to make in how you position extraction platforms over steam wells and then what tanks and extraction options you put on the top.

Like this one a lot. Nice bits, and strange theme for a heavy economic game. Market mechanic is great, and there is lots to think about from turn order to use of resources and working out what others will do.

But there are parts I don't like - so we play with house rules to change them :) 

- see my post on 'no auction variant', but in summary:

1. Die roll for platforms - adds huge random element for no gain that I can see 50/50 chance you get screwed if you're going late in the turn, how does that improve the game?

2. Auctions - followed by more auctions, all of them blind in that you don't really know what your opponents are bidding for ... makes the game take much longer than it needs to and adds another unnecessary random element.

** Update, no love for this with the current gaming goup :( so now up for trade (postage costs is a killer though!)

*** Update traded, although I'd happily play again.

Brutally unforgiving from even one early mistake in round one, with no hope of recovery. The stock market is not intuitive; but the game was so boring that I didn't care. Glad that it was over with so that I will never have to play it again.

Only played once, two-player and with a couple of rules wrong - rating is likely to go up. This is a very expensive, very heavy (mass) and very chromed game that in essence is about resource trading. A couple of neat ideas, but way over-produced.

Nice game with a great theme about collecting and selling ressources in a steampunk world.
It's a great game about economics with a dynamic market.
I really like it but after playing it with two players I have to say: the more the merrier.

Rating this a 9 due to its solid economic model (which I'd like to see more of in games!).   However, it's not a game I'd play frequently due to the intense planning required (which hurts my head) and the length of the game.

Still, there are some great concepts in this game and a lot to consider.  It is very heavily weighted on the strategy side of things, rather than luck.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating after one play; there's so much "there" there that I really can't begin to judge it.

Aesthetically, it's amazingly beautiful, in a dark and murky sort of way.  (It reminds me of the movie "Pitch Black.")  Playwise -- well, I'm usually not keen on economic brain-burners.  Power Grid leaves me rather cold.  But something about this game ...  Maybe it's nostalgia for M.U.L.E., maybe it's the fact that I can see the results JUST a second too late ... But it's fascinating.

I think the most intriguing part is that almost everything is predictable, other than the human element, but the choices are limited enough that you SHOULD be able to predict the market.  And yet, when the first player holds her crystal in reserve, and the second player dumps ALL his energy instead of saving a couple for next turn, and ...  The market is so deliciously volatile, even when nothing seems to be happening, and yet you know everything you need to know to look ahead.  What a delicious puzzle.

Not sure if I want to shell out that kind of dough just yet, but I'd love a few more plays of this.

When my husband brought this home I first thought it was a light, Steampunk-themed war game with tanks. Little did I know that it was a very heavy, "pure" economic game, and that those "tanks" were not war tanks, but actually factories that you purchase in order to produce resources.  

There are two auction phases, and if you spend too much in the auctions you won't be able to buy any tanks that turn. (Tanks are the most important way to move ahead in the game.) If, however, in attempting to make back the money you lost in the auctions, you sell too many resources, then you also won't be able to buy any tanks [i]next[/i] turn either (did I mention that buying tanks was the most important thing you can do in this game?). One bad move early on can cripple you for the rest of the game. Those who invest wisely will have more money, and thus will win more auctions, and will thus make more goods, and thus sell more goods for money, leaving everyone else far behind...

I am not an accountant. I have no desire to become an accountant, and even if an accounting firm offered me a high-paying job at their cool Steampunk-themed headquarters, I would still turn them down. No amount of "theme" can make this kind of grueling mental work fun. It's an excellent game. I just don't like playing it.

A bit on the fiddly side but there's a decent harvesting/trading game here once you get past the chrome.  And what glorious chrome it is - practically everything is overproduced and eith bigger or fancier than it needs to be, or both; while many of the bits aren't terribly practical at least they do look alien enough to carry the steampunk theming.  A first play with 4 finished in around three hours so I reckon this is a two hour game with a little experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
At least it's not very long, but this suffers from a serious endgame problem - there is a lot of stuff in the game, and all of it counts in the final scoring to various degrees, so the amount of math required to figure out the best play borders on the criminally insane. Clever in some ways, but just not interesting or fun. The goods market isn't that interesting - almost shades of Supremacy's horribly broken market mechanisms, although Planet Steam does work, basically, even if it does a fairly poor job of pricing goods fairly - and without that, it's just a lot of uninteresting cruft. For this game to be fun it needed much more streamlined final scoring, along with a much more interesting goods pricing mechanism, probably an auction of some kind.

This is a class of game that has been endlessly remade. Deal in 4 commodities which are useful in different proportions for building different infrastructure bits. It's a rather surprising how infrequently it's been done competently, and how often its been done badly, given such a great, simple exemplar was done 15 years ago in Settlers of Catan, and given how many great market-making games Reiner Knizia has done (Modern Art, Medici), and given how many good economic games are out there (1830/25, Container, El Capitan). Simpler and cleaner is so much better for this sort of game; Planet Steam is just an overwrought mess that doesn't really work.

RATING: 8
It's great to see a game where the market is integral to the game design rather than just an add on to it.  In my first game, I got too focused on getting the right materials to upgrade my production and such, rather than opportunistically making money.  I was really focused on building an engine, when really the game doesn't last long enough to really get an engine running.  You really have to pay attention to the market and adjust your production and capabilities accordingly in order to maximize cash earnings.  Overall, a pretty brutal game where there is a ton that you'd like to do, but you can't even come close to doing everything you'd like to do. 

The game is also very different from game to game depending on group think.  One game, water was tough to come by on the market and prices skyrocketed; the next game I stopped making water since it could be had cheaply and plentifully on the market.  You really have to keep an eye on what opponents are doing and adjust your strategy accordingly throughout the game. 

A great game if you like tight economic games.

One of my main criticisms about games is if they are too long ”for what it is”, meaning the time commitment doesn’t match the enjoyment the game provides (or rather the lack of enjoyment). Often it’s because of boring decisions or an excessive amount of luck. This game fares no differently; it’s just too long. If it had played 1-1½ hours quicker than the 3 hours it took (though it needs to be said that we were 4 inexperienced players with 2 new players), I would probably rate it higher and be more inclined to play it again. As of now, I’m willing to try it again, but if it still takes 3 hours, I’m not going to play it again. It worked okay with 4 players, but next time I would like to play it with 3 players so that the market mechanism gets a more significant role.

The game mixes some stock speculation with some auction and some spatial elements, but I have to say that none of them are particularly interesting… Stock speculation isn’t my kind of thing, and the amount of math required to figure out the best play and how much to bid in the auction or which goods to sell or buy is way too excessive! This reminds me somewhat of Power Grid; it’s a good game, but the amount of calculations just kills it for me (not that I’m bad at it, it’s just not a good mechanism in games)! This is enhanced and made even worse by the fact that you need to calculate/expect how the market is going to react due to the other players, and this is very hard to do. The market prices of the four different types of resources control how many robots are available each round, and while it is a very neat mechanic it, again, needs too much calculations in my humble opinion. The market works, but it’s hard to anticipate how it’s going to look if you’re the last player and the other players are selling or buying before you…

This leads me to the next important element of the game: the auction for turnorder and specials roles. I always enjoy games which include various unique roles, so this was a good thing though I felt the 4 roles were somewhat uninteresting; during the game I thought it mattered a lot, and while it obviously does somewhat, I now think that it’s more important to be first in the turn order. This is because you can buy cheaper robots (which was very important if there were few robots available) and, especially during the late game, the last couple of contracts worth 50 points, and then obviously because of how the market works. Of course, it might sometimes be better to be last if every player sells goods and you want to buy, so they have lowered the prices, but in my one game it wasn’t the case.

The spatial element wasn’t implemented in a satisfying way. The way you bid on terrain spaces and put your robots in a grid was okay, but not exactly groundbreaking. Also, it doesn’t matter too much as you can always change which robots produce which resource… Oh, and I really despise that you need to rely on the dice in order to get the space you want! This is a bad mechanic, and it was even worse during the late part of the game in which you basically had 50 % chance of getting a terrain space!? In our game it could actually have decided the game…

So, overall the game didn’t really appeal to me. It was too “mathy”. I don’t care about the steampunk theme, and the components (I’m specifically thinking of the robots) were good. I would be willing to play it again with 3 players, but I’m fairly sure that it’s not a game I am going to play more than that.

Planet Steam is one of my favourite economic games.  Buy mine shafts, collect resources from them, sell resources in a market that respects the laws of supply and demand (i.e. if you produce rare/high-demand resources you get more money per unit; flooding the market with a resource lowers the price for everyone).  Simple, mechanics, but definitely rewards careful thinking and planning a turn or two ahead.

Art style is fantastic; very steampunky.  The box is super over-sized though, especially given the number of components.  Could easily fit in a standard Fantasy Flight-sized square box if the board folded into 6 sections instead of 3.  Also, not a fan of the heavy reliance on auctions and a single (pretty useless) dice roll during one phase.

[b]Includes print and play copies of Saboteur and Manipulator.[/b]

Received by trading away Power Struggle and some cash. 

Initial rating a 9. I had high expectations for this one, and I originally stumbled across it as a replacement for Power Grid. With PG, I loved the commodity market, but grew frustrated at the drawn out auctions, the turn order mechanic, and the strange endgame. 

Planet Steam is not Power Grid, but it does scratch the same itch. I absolutely love how the game manages the resource market, with the ability to buy and sell resources as the prices fluctuate. Our first game took about three hours, but the time flew by, and I felt there were constant choices to make.

A couple other thoughts... if I didn't trade for this, there's no way I would have bought this. I don't like using the term "overproduced," as I admire game publishers that strive for some "bling." But the production quality for this game may have actually priced it out of popularity! Behind all the chrome is a solid game, and I'd be curious to see where it would rank if more people had access to it.

Update: I've played this a handful of times over four years, and I gotta say, this game is still strong. One of the best economic/market games I've played. FFG has released a more reasonable version of the game, but I'm glad I traded for the original copy with its piles of irregularly shaped wooden bits and big honkin' resource tanks.

It is more portable. :)  no more coffin box. And the rules are clearer with a nice summary of variants in the back. But if box size wasn't an issue, I think I'd stick with the wood tanks and plastic resources of the original version. I might keep both. We shall see.

Probably an unfair rating; this is a game of considerable quality but I found my initial play through terribly laggy and uninvolving. In games like this, where it's so highly predicated on how the players make the market, the fact that we were all fumbling newbies probably contributed to the fact that the ending felt like a massive anticlimax.

On the other hand, everyone else enjoyed it considerably, so maybe I was just on the rag tonight; further investigation will tell the tale.

RATING: 8.4
The first play has me tickled, if a little concerned.  It seems a solid game built around a nice feedback mechanism.  It may be a little too padded (bumper bowling?) to really put to hurt on other player positions.  If this ends up being a problem the game could become a largely tactical affair which would not be interesting.  Or, it's possible that there are some interesting predictive markets which are expressed through capacity expansion (both airship and factory) and, possibly, strategic withholding that could open up a deeper depth of play.  

I am excited  to explore it regardless and maintain some cautious hope for it.  

The FFG redesign is a mixture of thoughtful and absurd.  The color palette is an almost unreadable muddy with curiously inept iconography.  On the other hand, the rules were a breeze, much of the component design was smart, and I'm happy with its price point and size (though I would consider snapping up an earlier edition just for the bits if the game starts getting serious play).

This is another game that is hard to put my finger on.  There are lots of elements that I general don't enjoy (special power cards, weakly developed spatial elements, and fiddly components).....

...but the MARKET!  The heart and soul of the game is in the price manipulation in the market and I find it immensely interesting.  If only they could either come up with a more compelling companion mechanism, or distill the entire game to the price fixing, I would probably vault it to the top of my ratings.  As is, I consider it a flawed masterpiece, but I won;t get rid of it until I can find a game that scratches the market manipulation itch in the same way.

RATING: 10
I fell in love with this one instantly, at first play.

First impression: the components and production value are absolutely top notch. The price is not too high in light of that. You're getting some TLC in that box, from people who obviously really care about their game.

I've played Wealth of Nations, although very little MULE way back when. Wealth of Nations breaks down under the weight of a bunch of finely negotiated transactions between players. It truly becomes painful after a while.

Planet Steam has no direct player-player transactions, but it has plenty of interlocking economies to keep things really involved. The ability to manipulate the market is fabulous, both with the turn order auction and the depletion/flooding of units of a type of resource. There is a lot of player interaction there, and its very cut-throat. Its awesome!

The theme holds up surprisingly well, although frankly this game is a very abstract engine at its foundation. But between the components and the great art, I really did think we were mining steam, ore, etc and trying to make some money.

I wanted to play it again immediately. I'm looking forward to obtaining a copy for myself, and many repeat plays. The last game that felt this unforgiving and rewarding was Age of Steam. I think that's pretty good company, and I don't think I'm overstating it.

Far superior to Wealth of Nations, for comparison. There is more than adequate market manipulation, and leaving out the direct player-player transactions really speeds up play and takes the tedium away that haunts Wealth of Nations.

RATING: 7
Planet Steam is an economic game explicitly based on the old computer game MULE. Players build energy collecting tanks on the board which in turn produce more energy and resources of varying types. These resources are then used to purchase further upgrades or VPs, or can be sold to the market. This market is the seeming heart of the game, as players want to react to shortages in the market, cashing in when the opportunities present themselves.

The game is a good deal more complex in practice than this short description makes it sound, but that's the bare bones of the game. I played it initially with 5 at the table, which is clearly not ideal for this game as it shortens the number of rounds down to 4, and the game ended just when the market dynamics had started to establish themselves. I would like to play it again with fewer to see if the game dynamics are more effective at the lower scale. In the present, I think the system works and has some interesting nuances in terms of positioning oneself effectively on the board, buying upgrades carefully, and so forth.

People who really like snowball games with market dynamics are well-advised to try this one out. I have the feeling that the audience that this one will succeed with wildly is pretty small though. Tentative 7 based on my first play and my guess at how much I will like it with fewer simply based on the larger number of rounds which will allow the market to shine fully. Though the market price fluctuates at a fairly uniform rate across the scales, the ability to actually change what one is producing and to react to that is much smaller at the high player count, and even at the lowest scale, seems flimsy in comparison to the 12 round game of MULE. With 5 I would probably rate it a 4. The 7 I give it now is reflective of my general interest in playing it at the lower scale, particularly 3. I have no idea when I will have another opportunity to play this, but that's neither here nor there.

For those who have played MULE: similar but yet different, you would definitely know this was based on MULE even it wasn't advertised as such. Primary differences include more things to spend the goods produced on (i.e.: landers that are required to hold the materials you're collecting, upgrades to the MULEs that make them produce more, bonds); a market that fluctuates faster (prices go up and down after each player buys or sells rather than at the end of an entire round) and which is not auction based; and a lack of random events. I think people who like the computer game will at least enjoy PS, but I'm not sure if they'll prefer it or be able to justify the insane price tag. The main downside to PS seems to be the marketplace, which is not as interesting in PS because players can never sell directly to each other. PS also has fewer rounds than MULE does, by a significant margin. This affects the overall length of the market cycle (i.e.: not as many fluctuations) and, more importantly, it limits the ways in which you can change your position in the market (i.e.: what you produce). The basic idea of creating artificial shortages to reap large profits carries over though, and is still amusing. PS also plays significantly longer than MULE, clocking in at an easy 2 hours. Upsides are certainly present though: having to invest in storage capacity for the materials being produced adds tension, and there are more ways to directly affect the land grants you receive in PS, as well as land that starts out neutral and which can be controlled via "land grants" which are available via an auction role or which can be purchased with materials. As I said, PS is interesting, MULE-heads should definitely give it at least a go to see how they like the changes.

RATING: 4
This game is just too slow and boring.  

I played countless games of MULE on my Atari 800 and loved every minute of it.  This game captures none of the best elements of MULE. The trading table that feeds into the price of goods is a nice mechanic but doesn't come close to simulating supply and demand like MULE did (I don't think it is possible in a board game but the designers did give it a really good try). 

The price of this game is insane! The components are pretty to look at but are not as functional as they should be (the tanks). 

Did David Byrne help design the box?  Does it really need to be that big?

A bit fiddly for what it is.  You will likely do badly your first game as it's not very obvious what you should be doing early on.

There are some fairly unforgiving "breakpoints" in the game where if you misjudge a bid by $1, you can SEVERELY cripple yourself.  I would certainly play it again.  I'd be tempted to pick it up if it could be had for a lot less money.

After playing the game some more, I think I have to up my rating a little bit. I still feel like the complexity level is damn high, but it's manageable with practice and by constantly paying attention to the actions of the other players. Planet Steam is still not a game I would normally suggest, but I guess I will enjoy it on occasion.

[2012-10-29 Rating: n.a. -> 6]
Wow, this is a brutal and unforgiving economic game. There's no catch up mechanism whatsoever in Planet Steam and one small mistake can easily cost you the whole game. Because of the absence of a catch up mechanism, it's up to the players to prevent a runaway leader. This can be quite difficult with new players.

There are a lot of wheels to turn and since every single one can have a huge effect on the underlying economy of the game, turns in Planet Steam get complex fast. To me, it feels a little bit too much like work to be fun and the complexity level seems to be a bit outside of my comfort zone.

No idea why this game went from $100+ grail import to deeply discounted cut out. It's really very good. And the FFG production looks better than the original by far.

I think PS would particularly appeal to Power Grid fans (although it's a much better game, imo). There's the same area control component, the same upgrading of production facilities, but with a market that is more volatile than anything I've seen in any other game. Each sale immediately effects the price of goods. Sell something and the price goes down. Buy it and the price goes up. This leads to tons of screwage and paranoid angsty nail-biting.

And maybe I just answered my own question. It's relatively few gamers that like that kind of thing. I do.

EDIT: So glad I own this. I haven't played in three years and it's better than I remembered it. Unforgiving by design, easy to screw up, almost impossible to play through without one or two huge, unforgettable mistakes, which you can be sure you will forget and make again the next time you play. There's potential for lots of aggressive play but it's not easy to pull off any real screwage; you're too busy hanging on by the skin of your teeth. 

This game is hard to play well and I like that. Not for the feint of heart, not for the casual gamer, and not to be played just once, judged and rated. This game pisses people off, and it makes them pissed at themselves. Your first session will probably kick your ass. If you're the kind of person who is motivated by that to try again, you'll have found a keeper for sure.

Imho, it's best to throw out the die and play with the 'deterministic' variant in the back of the rulebook for claiming territory, even in your first game. There's no place for randomness in a game with this much highly sensitive player interaction.

A vastly overproduced economic game with only a passing connection with it's theme.

It's also a gamers game so don't try and get the non-geeks to play based on the steam-punk theme as they are going to be a bit dissappointed.

The game itself is pretty good and requires sound and precise playing.

Great game. Alot of resources and chart changes to keep up with. Played a 3 player game today with two people already knowing how to play. Game still took a solid 3 hours to play. This one will be a little harder to get to the table because of the time needed to play. Games like Imperial may be better when looking for a longer meater game. This game probably has the best bits around!

Players are entrepreneurs, investing in Planet Steam, and trying to turn a profit.  Business game, where players invest in deeds on Planet Steam, then install hardware to tap four types of resources - water, ore, energy and quartz.  Resources are used to build further infrastructure, and also can be bought/sold on the markets (one market for each resource type).  Players can empower their turns by bidding on the special characters available at auction each turn.  The most money on hand after a fixed amount of turns wins the game.  

Fine, fine business game - no more complex and just as good as Funkenschlag/Power Grid.  The production on the LudoArt edition is simply insane, complete with coffin box and chunky wooden pieces.  Great stuff - I will play this any time.

My kind of euro, tight economic engine rather than VP salad. The game is all about manipulating the market and selling at the right time, similar, if far simpler and shorter, to 18xx in many respects. The FFG version has great plastics and looks very nice, some of the symbology and visual design could be clearer.

Highly disappointed.  I got this game because on the surface it looked cool and it was even more awesome that it was inspired by M.U.L.E., an old PC game I played a bajillion years ago.  Sadly, Planet Steam is missing something the original game had, or I have simply grown up and need cheaper thrills.

I find the market manipulation fascinating, but the rest of the game, though very pretty (FFG version), was either tedious or completely irrelevant.

The ideas in here are so great, but something wasn't sitting right with me.  I'd like to give it a few more goes just to see if it grows on me, but maybe the actual licensed M.U.L.E. game is where I need to focus.

Played my first game of Planet Steam. Simply put, I fell in love with the game and want my own copy.

Reserved my own copy. Looking forward to its arrival.

Heard it was best with 4 players. Read that 5 players last only 4 turns. Not sure that 4 turns is enough in a game like Planet Steam.

Enjoy the economics of Planet Steam. Very cool bits. I enjoy quite a bit the theme of the game.

Very happy this game is in my collection. A real winner in my book.

Rating after 1 play. Loved my initial play, but this is strictly for the serious gamer. casual gamers should AVOID.

The game kind of takes the powergrid economy  as a template and builds on it. great for a serious gamer terrible for anyone who isn't. Gameplay is entirely market drive, and about making resources an selling them for a profit.

the game is full of minor rules points and timing which have significant impact on the outcome and the likely enjoyment of the game. All of this leads me to believe that unless you play the game often, a rereading of the rules would be required for someone who only plays once ever so often.

component quality is really good and then not so good, and that isn't including the oversized empty box...

all of which is one reason i'm deeply torn, i really enjoyed my initial play, however due to the high cost and the storage issues of the HUGE box, and a rule set that isn't conducive to infrequent play, it's pretty unlikely that i will buy this game. a shame.

2013-12-24 : A resource gathering and market manipulation game. Not a bad game, but a bit of a disjointed one : a game that never really flows well and where you have the feeling that gameplay should have been a bit more streamlined because the game takes too long to play for what it is. Great components and  I very much like the way the market works like a real market with a slightly delayed reaction to buys/sells. Warrants another play.

Another spreadsheet game for the crowd that likes to competitively fill in cells and not have to talk much to one another; the board is largely superfluous. You’re basically all influencing market prices by buying and selling, and every game will be different in this regard, but it could all be done off-board with individual spreadsheets via an app and it’d be the same experience. To some, this type of economy creation is sublime, but I find it annoying in the highest degree because the game is asking you to do a heavy load of calculating but – get this -- without a spreadsheet! How well can you do it? That’s the ostensible fun of the game. 

There are two auctions, and if you spend too much you won't be able to buy any tanks that turn, so the challenge comes down to making mathematical calculations and anticipating future purchases. "Shoulda kept that one energy, huh? Shoulda bought one more ore, eh? Shoulda got one more water, hmm? Did you forget you needed water to activate as well as buy a tank and you needed to anticipate the price of tanks rising?" (head explodes). I quote myself from my PG: Factory Manager comment:

[q]Here we go again. This game is very much like Planet Steam -- a glorified spreadsheet that should be "played" by a computer to calculate things out for maximum efficiency, not by a human. The human should pick up the report off the printer, but not actually do the calculations. That's why we invented them.[/q]
And one last dig before I go: the bits suck -- they don't stick together and the caps kept falling off the tanks. I call shenanigans on it. For that price, I would expect things to hold together.  It was Planet Jenga.

I was just getting up to speed when the game ended.  Balancing energy & other resources is tricky. Going first is pretty important, but if you spend the money to do it, then you might not have enough money to do other important actions.

I am a sucker for beautiful boards & nice components.  I do wish, however, the upgrades seated better in the tanks--most of them kept falling out which was disappointing.  For $120 that shouldn't happen.

In every game of Planet Steam, I end up at some point in the middle feeling like I'm totally screwed and having to completely shift gears in reaction to how the whole ecosystem is evolving.  Nothing speaks higher of a game for me than that.

The market is what truly makes this game.  Being able to influence the derivative of price is fantastic.  I don't know why more games don't do the same.  

There's three main ways to score points: selling resources, building infrastructure, and buying deeds of ownership.  Each successively yields less cash in the short term, but more value over the long term.  It would be obvious then, to pursue the longer term strategies for maximum points, but the catch is that sometimes resources are very cheap, you need cash for tanks, and a few roles can be wildly powerful - all rewarding you for having cash on hand.  In the end, you're pulled in all directions trying to ride the current market ecosystem to maximum profit.  

I will say that I would normally despise such heavy use of auctions in which you don't really know what is being auctioned off, but in this case I feel like the big money really only comes out in questions of turn order and sometimes resources in which case what is up for auction is fairly clear.  Role selection is important, but tends to take a back seat in my mind until the previous two things are no longer worth it from a monetary standpoint.

Easily some of the best value for my gaming dollar despite the price.  My only complaint is that it would have been nice to have a smaller box, not because it is wasted space, I actually like its commanding presence, it's just a touch too big to fit in my game tote.

Rather maths-intensive economic optimisation game. I suspect if you like Power Grid: Factory Manager you'll also like Planet Steam, and if you actively dislike it you'll not warm to this, either.

If you're somewhere in the middle (like me) you might enjoy Planet Steam a bit more since it is a good deal more complex. The fluctuating resource market alone means that it isn't as easy to predict which resources will be the most valuable and the best actions aren't always as obvious, especially in the long term.

That said, the amount of information available can tempt players to precalculate everything in advance. I'm not sure I have ever seen a game more susceptible to AP-prone players. When that isn't an issue the game is still a long one but doesn't really feel like it which is always a good sign.

Played once, with five players.  It barely works with five players because the game lasts only four turns, and that just doesn't give the market enough time to cycle through its buying and selling stages.  When the price for goods is low, the bank will run out of those goods.  Then it takes a while for prices to rise before players are willing to sell the goods they've been sitting on.  Four turns just isn't enough for this to play out in an interesting way.  Planet Steam is surely better with fewer players (3? 4?), but I doubt I'll return to the game.

Solid economic game wit nice but fiddly bits. As most games of that genre it suffers from analysis/paralysis and a runaway leader problem. Evenmoreso experienced players may nearly break it by:  First player in first round buys all available crystals. Second player buys all available ore. Then the following player(s) do not have many useful options left... furthermore there won't be any new tanks in the game due to the shortage of goods...  did I already say that I don't like the artwork?

I like the steampunk setting, but the game does nothing interesting with it. It is essentially a heavy economic game, with some auctions added for good measure. There are many intricacies with the various resources, but it all comes down to a lot of number crunching, which really isn't my idea of fun.

However, I applaud Fantasy Flight for releasing a well-regarded game in a properly sized box and for a fair price (both were ridiculous in the original edition), not to mention the pretty miniatures in metallic colors.

Great game that is hindered by the die roll when you drill a new well.  Needs a house rule to fix it but haven't really decided what that is yet.

I traded away because Wealth of Nations is superior on all counts which matter to me.

Nearly 30 years after its release, M.U.L.E. remains my favorite computer game of all time.  Planet Steam is not my favorite board game of all time, but it ranks very highly.  The board game captures the essence of the computer game impressively.  With a fairly simple set of rules, the game manages to give players a lot to think about and a lot to do.  In a crowded field of economic games, Planet Steam stands out for its mechanics and for all around fun.  Definitely a winner!

Well designed but I wonder if winning Lady Steam in the last auction is too powerful ... oh well, better bid high!

I think I prefer it with less players as I'm really enjoying the 2 player game at the moment.

Unexpectedly, given its completely unreasonable box and sci-fi components and theme, this is a heavy economic game, and a very good one.  The turn order and the careful financial planning that must be done each turn are reminiscent of Age of Steam.  The resources have different uses in the game and can be sold and bought (or not) during the game, in a way that adds an element of speculation to the game.  Prices can be manipulated too.  And then there's the matter of building things in the right place--geography matters.  Altogether, this makes a fascinating and rather unusual package, albeit one that I find it difficult to wrap my head around. (1 play)

[for sale/trade: $30]

Excellent heavy economic simulation with area control elements, excellent-looking pieces with snap-in upgrades. Massively overproduced, otherwise this could and would have gone for $75+ easily.

Note: it's fairly heavy, so shipping may be a few bucks extra.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

Money makes the world go round as it does this game. Planet Steam was my first delve into commodity speculation mechanics and it has been a very enjoyable one. The overall enjoyment of the game, for Yuki especially, has skyrocketed as we have become more familiar with the nuances of predicting and exploiting the market. Unfortunately, the area control aspect of the game falls rather flat with two people. We have gotten more accustomed to blocking a straight row of area control for resource acquisition, but it is still overall a rather dull affair compared to the excitement of the Wall Street simulation. We still need to play with a calculator on the table between us, but I can definitely feel my brain expanding and calculating better on it's own after every play. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- You have to allocate every dollar on every turn and allow for market fluctuations if you want to win (Brain-burn central!)
- The ultimate money game
- The pieces for the game are immaculate
- A great sense of expansion and success as your number of tanks and piggy-bank grow

[b]Cons:[/b]

- The area control is quite flat in a two-player game
- It is quite easy to find yourself with no cash and no way of getting cash if you don't plan with a massive amount of foresight 
- You really need a calculator by your side making a massive amount of downtime if players don't play simultaneously.  

[i]F.Y.I .[/i] - Our enjoyment of the game increased dramatically once we started taking simultaneous actions after the tanks are initially bought from the tank market in Phase II.

Whoa, this is an intense game. A little fiddly; there are so many moving parts that I will probably never be very good at it; and it's both easy to make mistakes and mistakes can be pretty unforgiving, which can be frustrating. But I like it anyway! I love how much the economy depends on the actions of the players. I think the complexity of the game might be necessary, in that if it were simpler, things might be more prone to groupthink and predictability; instead it's kind of a wild ride.

EDIT: I've finally tried the reedition...
I generally dislike prices and market manipulation game.  And this game is an example why.  I'm not interested in speculations like 'X is rising by 4 and - hey! - there is a chance it will drop by 6 in the next turn so maybe I should...'.  Yaaawn...  Snorrr..rrr...
Tight and demanding game, but definitely not for me.

--

Absurd approach from the publisher.  Size and execution (-->price) make me NOT want to buy it (or even try it).  Otherwise I would be very interested.  It's a heavy economic game with good reviews after all.
I wonder how many more customers were detrred too, because of the same exact reasons.
I truly hope the publisher made big losses on this product - I support mindlessness (or intentional targeting the product to the elite only) to be punished.

RATING: 5.1
I have to say that I was a bit surprised that most people consider this a medium-heavy weight game, it's actually very straightforward. You build as efficient of an engine as you can and invest in certificates when you can afford them. The only real crux is when to sell resources vs when to hold onto them to build. That essentially comes down to the current sale price, supply, and your future building needs.  I never felt as if I were making any truly tough decisions beyond (possibly) how much to bid in the auction.

I'm not a fan of the theme and it's not as heavy of a game as I would have liked, thus the lower rating.

Interesting economic development game with almost no luck (the dice roll for platform placement though did favor one user over the other two of us).  Bits are a bit fidley.  I won my 1st game partly by betting early on buying crystal on 1st round when it was cheap to buy a couple of compressors.

If not for the absolutely disgustingly overwrought production, this game would probably be an 8 or 9.  But what could be a relatively quick to set up game turns in to a monstrosity that becomes an event.  I won't say no to it if I want to play it, but I will never contemplate owning this game as is, because I will never take it out of the box.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2013)

I think this is a game I would have loved when I was a BGG newbie, I still liked it a lot, but if I´m going to play a medium weight game with long time duration (as Planet Steam), I (generally) prefer to play something meatier. The components, as usual from FFG, are top notch, I would have liked that the Superchargers were a different color than the tanks as they are hard to distinguish. The art is great and I´m inclined to like  the theme.

The game can take a long time to finish, however there is relatively little downtime as you are always planning your next move . It is a good economic  (market manipulation) game. It has low luck (claiming zones via dice), and lots of things to consider, a great plus in my book. 

I also like that the game (2nd edition) comes with many variants ready to play.

I want to play again soon, but I´m not buying this for now, perhaps the rating can increase after more plays.

Current Rating: 6.5

I ended up buying the game on a sale and the opportunity to play it has arisen many times, however I always have resisted further plays of Planet Steam. That’s weird but I always never want to play it, so for now I’m downgrading its rating. I`m not a fan of the steampunk setting.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 7
I have a lot of respect for what this game's trying to accomplish.  In many ways Planet Steam feels like a better version of Greed, Inc.  It has the high-stakes auctions, though scaled back a bit.  It has the same two-tiered commodity market where there is a price scale and a price trend scale.  This is a fantastic mechanic and I'm pleased to see it implemented in a game that isn't broken.

Part of the my frustration comes from first-game cluelessness but part is inherent to the mechanics.  Specifically the auctions have complex effects that aren't easily understood - and it can be death to be too late or too early in the turn order in certain situations.  I'm not a big fan of high-stakes auctions in a long, heavy economic game - I prefer the resolution to occur quickly because an auction is so easy to screw up.  If we can get the game down to a Brass-like playtime then perhaps I can live with them.

I think I'll enjoy this game more if I play a bit more frugally - being cash-poor really reduces one's options and I can't stand that in a game.

I need to try again after the bad taste of the first game is gone.  I'm pretty sure a 7 is the lowest possible rating I can give this game - might go as high as 8 or 9 if my next play or two really blow me away.

RATING: 8
Arithmetic intense economic stock market game in a steam punk flavor where every player tries to profit from commodity fluctuations. Top notch components and artwork. Slight grudge: when the board is filled with tanks producing different amount of resources due to the airship, synergies and super chargers, it will get hard to see how much of each resource gets extracted and added to the economy. It's hard to keep and overview, because you need to look at all the little attachments on the tanks to figure it out. Nevertheless, an impressive game and one of the better economic games out there.

First impression rating based on a single play with the basic rules. The importance of turn order on the final turn seemed a bit too heavily weighted. There are some neat mechanisms here.

Note to self: try hard(er) not to run out of money next time. Oh wait, that's what I said last time.

In Planet Steam, the Interplanetary Federation (IPF) has discovered a resource-rich planet, and you run one of the first companies on the scene. One aspect of the game feels familiar: you need quantities of ore, water, crystal, and energy to build up infrastructure. The other aspect of the game confounded my group: the four resources may be bought and sold in a fluctuating commodities market, and navigating this market is the only way to obtain operating cash. Cash flow can be a real headache, and without it you're dead in the water. The game is played over 4-6 turns depending on the player count, and each turn (year), you hire a specialist that enhances your operations in some way and determines the player order for market manipulation. 

What I'm looking for here is a robust sense of options. At least, that's what I'd been lead to expect. So far the learning curve is kicking my ass, but I'm liking it better bit by bit.

RATING: 8.5
Very effective economic game where values of commodities fluctuate radically with supply and demand.  The dynamic way in which values change is what really makes this game work.  Each element ties nicely with the others in subtle ways.  Controlling player order, choosing the correct role at the right time, and knowing what to produce all have surprising consequences as the game unfolds.

-----
As a fan of challenging economic games I had high hopes for Planet Steam which may be part of why i was slightly disappointed. Valuating the role cards in the auctions, predicting the market and preparing accordingly, planning ahead for next turn's production all work fine but considering the play time of close to three hours Planet Steam as a whole falls short of economic benchmark games like Age of Steam, Power Grid or Indonesia as it is lacking the depth of decisions compared to this peer group. The strategy in Planet Steam is generic: be prepared for next turn's purchases and production requirements. Beyond that it is tactical optimization. There's no clear sense of progress. Each round is more or less a repetition of the previous round. With five rounds in a four-player game it outstayed its welcome for me. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game. I just was hoping for more.
On a side note, Planet Steam is supposedly based on the C64 classic M.U.L.E. which I used to play and love. It may be my deficient memory but no glimpse of recognition rose on my first play of Planet Steam.
Finally, my repeatedly voiced critique of Czarne's artwork is valid here as well. Contrary to the usual opinion, I don't enjoy the style and don't consider Planet Steam as an outstanding contribution in the design department. He already drenched Hermagor in a muddy brown puddle and repeats it here.

Er, too tempting not to buy with the mention of Blade Runner and retro look in some reviews. Rating is based on the numerous times i have lost at the computer version. Getting the hang of it now but can't wait to use the wonderful board game components in a real game.

Off the mark by teaching my first 'proper' 4 player game which went pretty much to plan with me coming in 3rd - I never said i was good at it! Next time......

I usually don't like economic games and i tend to play them by feel rather than trying to do all the calculations, which i find much less stressful. I've done enough difficult sums in my time. Planet Steam is such a beautiful game that it is a joy to play, even though i would probably not choose to play it if it was a chit heavy production. I think this is a clear case where the components have influenced my rating.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First off, the game is wildly overpriced and does not merit such a large box, except to try and make you feel like you got what you paid for.  The components are nice, but nothing really too special.

I'm surprised by all the comments about the art.  I'm not sure what it is about me but I find most of the artwork in the game quite ugly.  Now I've never had much of an interest in steampunk and honestly never even knew it existed until Mission: Red Planet came out, but there's nothing appealing to me about the art.

The game itself is pretty fun - a very steep learning curve, but it really does feel like a challenge.  I think you definitely have a lot of influence in how the market works, but it feels weird trying to manipulate it.  Whereas many of the recent Ystari games have so many scoring opportunities that it's hard to formulate a strategy, I think this game feels a little more open - I think a better player should win.  

Still, Planet Steam's staying power will rest on future plays.  The playing time needs to come down, and requires that everyone is already familiar with the game, as I don't want to go around and teach it all the time.  If we can speed the game up I think it could possibly become a favorite.

[FFG version] 
Its not the easiest of games to judge. Its a bit too mechanical and fiddly (especially the constant updating of the price track). The game is okay, its an optimization game essentially. Players try to upgrade their tanks and extract minerals and sell them.

Components for FFG version are fantastic, much better than the original wooden pieces. Everything really works here.

10 plays in, I am now rating this a 10.  This is such a tight economic game!  My most recent play featured a particularly tough sales environment.  No commodities ever topped out on the chart.  Indeed they struggled to achieve mid-range prices.

I like how the market is different depending on how the players utilize the terminal.  I had fun manipulating the tank replenishment status as the last player in several instances of my last game.

I am a big fan of the compressor domes, and try to avoid buying the 50 pt papers anymore.

Planet Steam has one of the best funtioning market mechanisms in all of gaming. Its hard to describe how impressive to see a market system that actually functions as it should and creates interesting, dynamic fluctuations clever players can anticipate and take advantage of.

Unfortunately rest of the game doesn't live up to the market. Outside the market Planet Steam isn't dynamic or interesting + the components are both ridiculously over produced and not very functional.

Another nicely designed game that seemed to be lacking in much of that old thing called 'fun'. Infact the most enjoyable part of the game was rolling the dice to see if you could build a platform in your preferred location!! HUGE swings based on trying to second guess what people are going to buy/sell - which is, basically, a gamble.

I would play it again to see if i am missing anything but i doubt i would ever request it.

Something similar to Power Grid - but in the end i would rather play that (and i'm no PG lover either!)

This is a good game. A tight economic game that looks very good.

Con: The board could have been clearer, and the resource tokens better chosen. Quartz is a black gem, water is a colorless gem, which could have been a bit more intuitive, such as blue (see-through) discs for water and quartz colorless gems. The english rules could have been better. For example, who starts the auctioning of the empty space? Venturer or startplayer?

A heavy economic game.  The components are pretty good with chunky plastic pieces.  The game begins by auctioning turns to select a role.  You select a role and then there is another auction for a space on the board. You get to claim a spot on the board as well.  Then you can buy or sell at four markets and then you setup for a new turn.  The game incorporates demand and has a very interesting market mechanism.  

I like the game, but I don't love it.  It is surprisingly dry even with all the cool pieces.  I don't know why as I really love Captains of Industry which is an market economic game as well, but that seems to have a bit more soul than this game.  I like it but it could drop for me with more plays.  

The worry I have is that it seems plays have a tough time keeping markets from maxing out.  I need to play more times to see if this is better controlled.

Have now played twice with 4 players. Took about 3 hours with rules and playing with 3 newbies. Nice economic game. After my first play I was kind of "meh" but improved with second play-I suspect because I had a better idea of how the market was going to work. The wooden bits are fantastic. You'd think for the price, and in comparison to the box and wood bits, that the paper money and certificates and building licenses could be on something a bit sturdier/more durable.

Apart from creating their great LCGs and big shiny games for hot licenses, one more niche activities of Fantasy Flight Games seems to be the republishing of grail games. With Planet Steam, this served to actually raise my interest in the game, since the German original struck me as a tad too garish for the price. The ridiculous box size was not exactly a selling point, either.

So, scaled down to a size that does not require you to remodel your house around it, and illustrated in a more conventional, but also far more appealing fashion, what about the game lurking behind it? It is, as far as I can tell after one game, a straightforward and very good economy game, revolving around a nifty trading phase where good timing is of the essence – whether you want to be the first player or the last depends a lot on your needs and the stocked resources of your competitors. Since the various resources also fulfill different building needs, just pumping up production for a single good can be risky, even if it nets you a lot of trading money. 

My rating is preliminary; if the game is stable with other player counts (we tried first with three), it will very likely increase. Including all the promo expansions for the original directly within the box is a very laudable effort, even if you'll probably want some games under your belt before you add them to the mix.

Must play again with more than 2 players - Have played the computer game (maybe 50 times).  Pretty components, cool artwork.  Nice market mecanics.  The box is way too big however.  They could have cut the map and make a square box.

Quite a tight game.  Planet Steam is a game of choices and planning.  The concept of the market driving the player economy is very interesting.  I particularly like the auctions.  It makes for epic decisions and great interaction between the players.

Planet Steam is often compared to Power Grid because of the similitude between some of the mechanism (auctions, choosing a place on a "grid", tight money).  The comparison is somewhat real but there is more going on in Planet Steam.  It's my kind of game.  The only drawback is why the hell did they chose a box so big!  The game could easily have fitted in an Arkham Horror size box if the board had been cut in 6 instead of 3.

Session report:26-04-09

First up on one table was Planet Steam, which now currently holds the award for Mostest Nicest Bits. Howard, Martin, Dave and myself sat in for this one. Coming in a ridiculously large box, it was opened to reveal dozens of lovely wooden pieces that you variously upgrade in order to produce goods. It also gave Howard a chance to use his poker chip set rather than the fiddly paper cash you get in the box...

Almost entirely purebreed "Eurogame", there are only 5 turns in a 4 player game in which to get your production engine up and running. Four elements of quartz, ore, water and 'energy' are what you're drilling for. Once you get some goods in you can either upgrade and produce more or better facilities or you can hit the market to buy and sell.

The way the market works is fantastic, more goods sold into the marketplace drives the price down, a shortage of goods drives the price up, and the fluctuations can be huge in the space of just a few player turns...so if you're in last place you can suddenly find yourself with a surplus of almost worthless goods.

There's a tiny concession to randomness through single use of a die to see if you can successfully build a platform at a specific location, failure results in either building elsewhere or receiving a compensatory amount of cash.

The steampunk look is fabulous, with all the artwork working together really well.

Luckily we were all playing fairly speedily and finished up in around two hours, but this game could easily drag if you're lumbered with more over-analytical players...

I enjoyed this game, but I'm not sure if I've actually learnt anything to improve the next time I play...Indeed, apart from the theme which is loads of fun, I'm most reminded by Power Grid, which I also really enjoyed, but have only played once a year ago and don't miss at all...

4/10/17 So far I have played one 2 player game controller both players to learn the rules. I did however, really enjoy it (bidding against myself is hard), and am looking forward to playing it again. Rating it an 8 on assumption but might revise after more plays.

7/29/17  Last week we played my first 5 player game. What a fun game this turned out to be. And a lot simpler than I had imagined. I definitely learned a lot and will do many things differently knowing better how it all works, but I am very eager to play again, hopefully soon.

It has auctions, which is a plus for me in just about every game. I think the derivative market is great. It also seems like you have the ability to change strategies midway through the game and still do well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fairly heavy economic game to get going but once you understand the turn structure it becomes fairly straight-forward.  There are a ton of auctions and book-keeping (prices drop and fall depending on demand fluctuations).  You drop tanks onto the board to mine resources and there's an interesting mechanic wherein you may not get to drop it where you want -- unless you won the prospector powers bid.  

Despite the great steam punk theme and art this is really just an economy game of trying to build an engine that will allow you to take advantage of the market.  I really didn't grok the strategy until 3/4th's through the first game as the market swings are not readily apparent.  

My biggest complaint -- and this holds for many engine-type games -- is that it's very difficult to catch up if you get behind early.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
seems a little less entertaining the first go around as compared to container/wealth of nations.  tough to get a feel for initial auction / shaft auctions and those take at least a play to have any real idea on value.  

played with 3.  3 is interesting, i am guessing that 4 is better.

Overproduced euro business game with resource management, auctions, role selection, unit placement.  Reminds me of a combination of Power Grid and Puerto Rico, only not as good.  Nice bits.

Game play is ok, but not worth the price (at least 2 to 3 times the cost of other euros) when there are so many better eurogames out there in the same gamespace.  Concerned about game length and gameplay variability in the long run which seems like it might be limited.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Definitely not for me. The market moves cleverly but invites a level of system gaming I don't enjoy. Buy something to increase demand, then sell that same thing for just a dollar or two profit. Not fun. The "map" is a simple abstract square grid. The coin flip settlement introduces pure randomness in the least welcome of places. Pass.

Rating after 1 play.  Would be higher, but I'm concerned by the auction mechanism - firstly, the repeated auctions take a long time, secondly, the other players' choices can have a big effect on your game, even if you win the action you want.  Also, soulless, despite the sumptuous bits.

I think this is a half hidden gem. If you like resource management games, you should not miss this. 

It is expensive, but the material is really wonderful.

A lot of player interaction (of particular mention the tense auctions to choose the character that will "support" you each turn).

Simple, but very effective simulation of a market in which prices grow or fall based on demand.

Recommended.

This is a fascinating game. The economic meachnics in this game are very well implemented, making it possible that you earn fortunes with commodities that you yourself did not produce at all (buying low, selling high, that is). The ever changing order in which players take their actions (and roles) is another really cool feature of this game! I love it.

Buy land, build extractors and holding pens, extract resources, spend 'em to build your engine further. The pieces in your engine earn VPs so its win-win, and eventually you'll convert resources into pure VPs. The interaction is the auction to gain a special power each turn, plus the auction to get more land, plus turn order can be important when buying and selling resources. Other than that, it's very plan-plan-plan your spend, plan your next turn as well, then execute. Making it a bit more sandboxy than I was expecting. It's also pretty unforgiving with mistakes in the early game, given it's a snowball affair, which is generally not a good thing for a 2 hour game, so it gets marked down for that. I wouldn't mind playing again to see if I can do better, but I'm unsure whether the game is actually interesting enough to be fun or whether it's more of an exercise to improve at.

Based on one play: The first thing you will notice are the peices, this game is very over produced and the production pieces are actually a little annoying. The gameplay seems like you are playing multiple games at once as there is production, a market and special roles that are tough to link together. Some of the roles or rules don't really make sense and some appear much better thn others. Given all this, the game is interesting and requires more plays to really determine if it all works well together.

This game has beautiful components and looks like it's dripping with theme, but in actuality, it's one of the best economic engine games I've played.  Players auction roles that give them special abilities, as well as claim territory, and build factories that produce certain resources.  Players can then buy and sell resources to the market, and use remaining resources to improve their engine.  However, if too many people are buying a given resource and no one is selling, the price skyrockets.  This is a difficult game with a steep learning curve--with players of disparate skills, you can get runaway winners (or losers).  When everyone is around the same level, though, this game can be a fantastic experience.

I liked this game. It's a bit dry, but the bits are really cool and the main focus is the price manipulation of what's available and what needs to be sold. It's also got bidding with a touch of area control. I'm not sure I can get many people to play it though, but it was enjoyable. A few fiddly rules, but nothing too bad.

Still the best game I have played with a market mechanism. The purchase and sales of resources does not directly change the price in a linear way but it changes the rate at which the price fluctuates.

Definitely a lot of player interaction and turn order is very important in this game.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a game with a theme that you can feel - to me it's like the world of the movie The Chronicles of Riddick or maybe Total Recall - futuristic, gritty. I like it, very industrial, economic tension that only builds. Definitely has a very visible way of showing for every action there is a reaction. It's a hard-to-explain game to novices and I would only teach gamers that will be able to grasp the full game mechanics, because every step in this game builds you or destroys you and every purchase or sale can help build or destroy the market. This can be a very strategic game or terrible calamity in which all players suffer from one newb's errors. It is only a medium-weight game, but it is also a very long game - those gamers playing and enjoying it, will not feel the time go by, however those that are new and/or not enjoying it will learn to hate the game as the hours go by. It's not that long to a gamer, but to a light-gamer or new gamer, it will feel too long and if that person(s) is vocal, you will get an ear full. Select your players wisely.

The most agonizing, brutal, and unforgiving economic game I've ever played.  So many things I want to do, can I anticipate everyone else's motivations enough to forge my path through the onslaught?  Or am I stuck without water enough to fuel my plots?  One water in this game can be the difference between exultant victory and crushing defeat.  And order is everything.  

An amazing creation that also happens to be a game.  I feel pain every time I play this.  Pain that feels like growth.  The insight and clarity brought by pain.

The game seemed good, with its engine building prospects, economic stock market system. The role bonuses added to game until they help the player(s) achieve to much, to which it can continually give to much to player in front. 

I might rate higher with a second play as I will have understood the rules because of 1 game play already down.

Tentative rating after 1 play with rules error--we started with no platforms and resources were at maximum value from turn 2 onward. No one could produce enough. But I can see a gem of a game (so to speak) behind this.

Edit: The best of its genre I have played. Market mechanics reward foresight without being overly fiddly (read: Wealth of Nations). Components are fantastic. Theme is pasted-on but well-done. Tough decisions. (Do I sell for cash now or wait until the price rises, even though money now is worth more than money tomorrow?)

This is an economic game where you produce resources and then use them to upgrade your production or storage engines or sell them at a fluctuating market. The game looks short, in that you only get a few actions to do what you need to, but the rounds have lots of phases, so the game seems to progress very slowly. It's not a bad game. Certainly the way things produce is interesting, where you are aiming to set up chains of your tanks, and trying to time the market is pretty fun as well. The problem is just that there's nothing about this game that I would say really makes it stand out, in the face of the long playtime.

It is ironic how I have been known to complain about the lack of theme and fancy schmonsens in eurogames and here comes a game that sports a wagon car full of bits, a board the size of a small country and so much theme and artwork, it feels almost like an Ameritrash game.

But the core game mechanic is the market and the placement rules and the co-relation between production and selling of goods.

That being said, in this case, I am not sure all the bling and theme add much too the came and make the more interesting than it actually is. Sure, farming steam on a remote planet is exciting but most of it comes down to number crunching after all, no matter how creepy that worker looks or how futuristic the 'tank' might have been designed.

I feel like the designers went all out on making this a lavish production but this reminds me of the idiom that more is not necessarily better and in this case, I would have prefered a slimmed down and minimalist version of the same game.

The market is an interesting idea and remindes me of an old 3M game, Executive decision but it comes with a lot of baggage of which 70 % is just that.

Not a bad game but I feel it does not live up to its reputation of being an holy grail game and I have played much shorter and simpler games that still have a better flow and more rewarding gameplay.

Great bits, but at the cost of making an otherwise excellent game have limited accessibility.  An excellent commodities trading game with some ability to manipulate market supply/demand with production and buying/selling.  Probably a few turns too short of an epic stock market game, but still a very solid gaming experience (and a fairly lengthy game).  It's just too bad that the price will keep this game out of most people's hands.

 This definitely is a stressfully tight resource/money management game. I wonder how many people were drawn in by the gorgeous art expecting a super thematic game and found this brutal economic euro instead. Feels like it ends just as it starts getting good.

This is a game that my regular group played quite often for a while, although we haven't played in quite a long time now. I find it an interesting game, although not one I often would choose to play now. Despite the steampunk theme, this is an almost pure Euro with a very heavy economic element - the four available resources have various different uses in various combinations, but you can also buy and sell them (for money, which you need to buy some items and which also provides VPs) in an attempt to either make a profit or get the resources you need for next round. Add in auctions for different abilities each turn, and a small spatial element (involving the game's only element of randomness), and you have a heavy-ish game with plenty to offer.

Second play with 2 players was much better. The building at the end of the rounds was kinda weird, losing 1 of the extra resources each round, and always pushing 1 of the 2 used to build higher each round. The strategy seemed at first to always get one or the other of those 2 and sell them each time...but of course then they don't go up in value...so it works nicely. Better feel than Wealth of Nations, and less end game sells. Still just as limiting of a tech tree as Wealth has, but it works nicely in this case.

First game (4P) ran very smoothly with little or no rules confusion.  Perhaps I was lucky as I used the official English rules recently available.

We probably missed some of the impacts of the economic engine (manipulating the goods market) as one doesn't really see the value of certain goods without experience.  But started to see how things fit together as the game progressed and would like to replay the game with that newfound understanding.

Nice variety of bits (over produced comes to mind) in an oversized box with wonderful artwork.

I really enjoyed this game. A lot actually. There's a lot going on and it each small decision you make really weighs heavy on how well you'll do and that appeals to me. You pay heavily for mistakes and profit greatly from your triumphs. You can get screwed over by what other players do, but you have to adapt and do it fast.

I don't think my friends would enjoy this game at all, and with it's high price tag I'll probably never own this. But it would be a nice addition to my collection.

--Sep2009-- I really enjoyed the first play.  Lots to think about; lots of inter-player havoc.  I find it difficult to believe that a second game would play out similarly:  there are too many butterfly effects here for that to be easily accomplished.  For the moment, then, I'm eagerly hoping to play again.

As to the game, the bits probably aren't enough to justify the cost.  Still, the presentation is strikingly attractive (even if the box is dramatically larger than necessary.)  Turn order has all sorts of delightful side effects that aren't at all obvious in the beginning.  Yet the game is strangely forgiving:  it's hard to make no progress whatsoever.  I like it.

Yet another game in which players get resources in order to exchange them for production improvements or to achieve victory points, in this case mostly money.  It could have pass without notice, but its huge size and price didn't let it.  There is nothing really new here, even when its mechanic to adjust the prices of the different products according to the laws of offer and demand is very clever.  It feels in some way like an improved [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=98&Itemid=1]Wealth of Nations[/url][/i] and plays relatively more quick.

Yup, it is a heavy dry abstract economic game with a pasted on theme.  But it is a great game with wonderful a wonderfully represented theme.  Czarnè's art is astounding (although I hate the fireman, and of course that is the one image that they use for everything).

If you are interested in production and market games, then this is a great one to look to.  

It is a little tough to grasp what how this game is supposed to work from the rules.  Most of the overhead is for the market AI system.  Once you can get that down then you need to figure out how to play the actual game.  All in all it isn't difficult once you get the wheels in motion (although a player aid would have been tremendously helpful).

It is tough to see how to make money in this game, but as goods start getting exhausted creating shortages and synergy bonuses start stacking things really get rolling.

FYI, this works well with four, and even still the player that buys the fourth action (engineer) can really get humped for goods (although, they can potentially clean up on the market easier.)  I would never play this with 5, despite the cool power that the character has.

This was as much fun as a dry market game can get.  I suspect my rating will go up.

I think I'm becoming a grumpy old man at the age of 42 with my ratings.  It's an interesting economic game that I'd like to play again.  On the other hand, I'm growing wary of games with steep learning curves that take a long time to play without a big payoff.  One reason I think a designer like Knizia is so brilliant is that he can make simple ideas into great games that are easy to understand yet distill complex systems down to their essence.  It's like someone who tells a story with way too many details, while another person can tell you that same story in half the time yet still relate everything that matters.  Being concise is an underrated quality.  Here you have a game with a steep learning curve that took us three hours or so to play and I'm not convinced it has a better economic system than many much shorter games.  Also, that entire system seems non-intuitive to me.  In Power Grid, for example, everything makes sense.  You're running a power plant and need capacity and materials to make it run.  Here it's much more nebulous.

I guess my comment isn't very concise!

From 2 plays i think this might be a work of genius. The relationship loop between role selection/purchase/production/market is intricate and totally interdependent. The problem with the game is the theme - it works - but the people who should be attracted to the game might not see past the sci-fi trappings to the game underneath and the sci-fi crowd might not appreciate this Euro in disguise.
In particular the market mechanism is outstanding - the game hinges on timing/using it correctly. Very unforgiving first time out but worth it. Less keen after 4th play. The chrome is unnecessary. After repeated lays of the computer game uprated to a 8

5 players and with advanced rules is a different game, middle late turn order quite good! plus early certificates powerful

This is an intriguing game.  I found it to be slightly unforgiving in that you need to plan ahead so you have enough money to buy necessary resources to do what you want on the next turn.  In my one play (the first for all players), there was continuous 'oh crap' moments while each us realized we forgot something.  I think after a few plays the planning will become easier and then this game will shine.

At long last, I have a copy of this game that I have wanted for such a long time. The FFG version has much better components than I was expecting. 

I really like economic games. Planet Steam does some things well and some not so well. 

On the positive, the way in which the prices of the four commodities rise and fall based on a sort of delayed momentum is the best I've seen in any game. The components and artwork are excellent. 

What I'm not so keen on is that all the parts of the round turn feel overly fussy. The roles feel a bit gamey. 

Automobile does it so much better and cleaner in less time too.

Single 4-player game, and I'm smitten. Compared directly with [i]Wealth of Nations[/i], this game has a richer theme, gloriously artsy components, and much more dynamic gameplay. The way trading works is a particular hit; harder buy/sell/do nothing decisions, coupled with more dynamic resource pricing & availability.

Finally: A game box that looks down on Antiquity and Roads & Boats and taunts them for their puny size!

Economic/resource management game with a steampunk theme. The aim is to acquire plots on the board and then develop engines to extract four different resources from them. Once this has been done resources can be used to further develop a player's ability to extract more resources or can be sold at an ever-changing market, where they can be purchased too. Managing the economics of the game is the key to success, along with developing astute combinations of resource harvesting. This is a sophisticated an slightly unusual economic game that requires strong strategic choices to be made, but there is a feeling that the theme is pasted on ever so slightly.

The game has some interesting mechanic (tile placement, stock exchange for goods) but it seems to me too complicated for the porpouse it has.
I found the colors not for my pleasure. Also the bits are so strange for my taste. The space requirement is bigger than what it really needs to be.

Initial rating with room to move up or down. Having spent most of my wasted youth playing M.U.L.E. with friends on the Atari 800 (which had the very cool feature of having four joystick ports), I was anxious to try this one out. First impressions: Planet Steam does a terrific job of transfoming M.U.L.E. into a boardgame, I also was pleasantly surprised at how quickly this game moves. For a fairly complex commodity production, speculation and market-manipulation game, I thought it might be tedious or fiddly. On the contrary, it moves along at a brisk pace and the learning curve isn't too steep. That said, I think it will take at least several plays to really get a feel for the game and to start planning and optimizing the very few turns you have. My guess is it will have a high replayability factor ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Planet Steam is a faithful re-invention of M.U.L.E., right down to a carefully calculated--albeit high maintenance--goods market.  It has its flaws, including a repetitive buying/selling process, an uneven initial tile setup, and a high retail price.  That said, Planet Steam is an immersive game that should be polished and brought into mass production.

First Impression:
A highly polished economical game.

The game is at its a heart a simple idea that leaves room for extremely high player interaction. There is a sense of accomplishment though, as each player watches his economical empire grow from round to round, but the heart of the game is the market of the four resources and the impact of player actions upon it. Luck plays no role, but the game is nothing like an efficiency engine that can be solved pregame - you can't go anywhere unless you outsmart your opponents. The game is mainly tactical as the prices can fluctuate wildy from round to round, and there is practically no choice that has a limited impact on the game - whenever you have to choose (quite often really!), you can expect it to be a tough choice with serious impact on the final score. The production quality is amazing (ffg version), to the point that the art and components manage to give character in what could easily have been a dry game.

So what's not to like in this game? There is a strange die mechanism that can be bypassed and affects the game a tiny bit. It also takes a couple of turns to figure out what is going on. These are minor things really.

Overall this game won me with its great engine and its unexpected ability to project its theme. I rate it highly, I expect my rating to climb even more and this comes from someone who is usually uninterested in purely economical games.

Planet Steam was the surprise hit of BGG.CON for me and is currently my second favorite game of 2008 (just behind Ghost Stories). It wasn’t even on my list of games to try at BGG.CON, which is impressive considering the fact that the list had 129 games on it, far more than I could ever have hoped to play at the convention. Thankfully someone else suggested playing Planet Steam and we found someone to explain the game, making learning this fairly complex game a breeze (compared to what it could have been at least). I’m left wanting to play this rather rare and hard-to-find game again, and hoping that it gets a domestic reprint. Moreover, I’m hoping that the reprint comes in a much smaller box, with a smaller board and less over-produced components. I’d certainly pick-up a reprint, especially if it was a bit smaller/cheaper. As I said in Part 1 of this series, Planet Steam is a “deep and fairly long economic game with a very interesting supply-and-demand resource market (a la Power Grid). Trying to time the ebb and flow of prices is an engaging challenge.” While I don’t enjoy Power Grid, I’d been hoping to find another board game that employed a similarly interesting supply-and-demand resource market. Planet Steam involves producing four different types of resources in order to buy and sell them in a market where the prices fluctuate based on the supply and demand of your fellow players. Make the most money and you win. It was almost three hours long, but extremely engaging. I enjoyed other games that I expected to enjoy at the convention (such as Ghost Stories, Chicago Express, Le Havre, Dominion), but this was the sleeper hit (runner-up sleeper hit would definitely go to Red November, which was a surprisingly tense and compelling cooperative game that I quickly ordered due to its very small box size and price). It was really interesting in Planet Steam to try to generate resources so you could buy and sell them at the right time in the market as the prices fluctuated significantly over the course of the game. The market was particularly interesting because unlike Power Grid, the game itself doesn’t inject new resources into the market. Only the players sell resources into the market, so unless someone gets around to producing a resource, it’s guaranteed to be in short supply or nonexistent. The prices also seem to fluctuate a lot more than in Power Grid, so resources can go from being almost free to being extremely valuable, and then back again, over the course of the game, depending on what the players are producing and selling. Timing is key as the windows of opportunity in this game are short-lived and if you don’t seize them, then your opponents likely will, and they’ll make a killing in the process. I look forward to hopefully trying my hand at this economic simulation again soon.

[thing=23094][/thing], as per its description, is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious.

[thing=23094][/thing] is an economic game, with a little of bidding and a good deal of commodity speculation. There is no direct trading between players, which helps bring the time of play down, but does make it more solitaire, as all the interaction, except the initial bidding in the rounds, are indirect, coming from blocking or manipulating prices to hinder others and help you.

I found [thing=23094][/thing] to be very close in feel to [thing=2651][/thing] - you have the round starting with an auction, then turn order helps persons get Tanks cheaper, increasing prices for the next ones to play, then comes placing Tanks and producing, receiving income/resources. [thing=23094][/thing] is heavier on the economy side, while [thing=2651][/thing] leans more on timming, still, everyone at the table agreed the overall feel was quite close.

[thing=23094][/thing] is a nicely done, in which all the parts and mechanisms make sense and give players a lot of choices and possibilities throughout the game. Yet, it isn't the type of game I'm particularly fond of, as is mostly dry, being low on surprises, twists and theme. It works quite well for what it purposes, but I don't see myself going after it for more plays, though eventually it might happen.

Beautiful economic game and the detailed market is graspable & manipulable. The game system is resiliant to abuse, opposite to Container's sensitive player driven slipperiness. Devious & sophisticated economic game with role selection.

More play, could rise to a '10.'

Initial play...I liked it.  Fascinating cool mechanics, I like the theme, I like the artwork.  Acquiring land, buying tanks to extract goods, resources, buy and sell...+ make as much money as you can =  Fun.  This game is cool.  I want to play it again.

Played at ConnCon 2009 and WON! Really fun game reminiscent of M.U.L.E. It was so cool I had to get a copy, and now consider it my new most overproduced game (until I got Siam Deluxe!!). Lots of really cool bits, but could be made to fit in a box 1/4 the volume. Can't wait to play with local friends. Friends didn't like it much, seemed to think the economy didn't work somehow. Until they read other power gamers reviews of the game, now maybe there is something to it.Played again at ConnCon 2010 and had a really great time with it!

This has been improved since I played the prototype, but not enough - it is still rather predictable. My rating of 5 is actually high for the 5-player game (which I played), as it really suffers from lack of board space and from the small number of turns - I am expecting it to be better with 3 or 4 and am adjusting the rating accordingly.

This game is very punishing. My one play, first turn I chose to upgrade my tanks, because why not? But then all the water was bought out of the market by the time it got to me. And because there was no spare water, none was generated as a bonus resource. My second turn was essentially a blank as a result. 25% of my potential productivity in the toilet. More, really, because as a snowball game, the early turn gains net you more than the late ones.

I liked some of the concepts, and I can say I won't make that "mistake" again, but it's certainly not new-player friendly. I would recommend playing a practice round if there are any new players.

It could have also used some work on the usability end of things (graphic design/icons/colors/etc.)

Initial Impression; limited plays.

Many similarities to Wealth of Nations, but I much prefer this game.  Limited number of turns means the game won't drag well after the game is decided (if this game is decided "early" - it seems much less prone to that).  Much easier for players to adjust to the market, but I also like that the prices of items can still change without activity from the players if goods are not added to or purchased out of the system.

A highly produce steam punk game that unfortunately comes with a heavy price tag.  From what I read the game play is heavy as well, but that is not really a turn off (my wife like heavy games, but with a baby we would not be able to play it often).

I wish I could give this a higher score, because it does have great theme, and seems like the type of game I would like.  After 3 plays, now, I have determined that it cannot be played quickly, and really isn't as great as I initially thought.

RATING: 7
This game has some brilliant market mechanics, but sadly it has something less brilliant as well and that is the generally confusing layout and the mining shaft placement which just seemed redundant to me and prolonged the game unnecessarily. For what the game gives, the time spent is a bit extreme. The game would be a 9 or 10 if only playing time was shorter.

Beautiful game in a genre that I am just fond of: economic games.

Market is really intriguing in that pure speculation is probably a possible strategy.

Better with 4, 5 being a little too chaotic for my taste.

RATING: 6
Based on one play.  The game looks fantastic and is impressive set up.  The way the commodities market works is quite interesting.  My game was with 5 players.  I think the game would probably work better with fewer players.  By the time I felt the game was really starting to work it was over.  Several of the players felt that a 3 player game may be an ideal number to play.  I would certainly welcome the opportunity to play again.

A decent economics game with commodity speculation being the key component. At first play, it seemed like players' choices could cause big swings in others' fortunes. But more likely you need a few plays to figure out the value of things, especially those auctions for roles and plots.

Thinking this will be what I thought Kings of Air and Steam should have been, selling it as such to my group.
I am saying this is the "Factory" and blimp movement is implied and not actually needing a map for movement.
Might be more accessible to people who don't have the strategy "move units to here" mindset, will see.

Although a bit overproduced (to the point of the board being harder than it needs to be to use). This game does a wonderful job of capturing all sorts of varieties of market manipulation much like the old classic computer game.  Awesome game!

I really enjoy playing Planet Steam.  If you like heavy, unforgiving economic games this is a great one.  Balancing how to build your infrastructure vs having cash and materials on hand to do other things is interesting... and the player driven markets are fantastic (and sometimes brutal if you can't read/prepare for their upcoming changes... or a beautiful thing if you can!).  Not for everyone as this is long, thinky and a tad fiddly... but its one of my favorite economic games.

Didn't work for me at all.  Market manipulation in the game felt entirely too swingy.  Perhaps multiple plays would allow a better understanding of controlling the market values and realizing them, but there are about 80 other economic engine games I'd rather be playing.

After 1 Play: A particularly interesting and interactive market mechanism.  I'd like to play with fewer players, because with 5 there are only 4 turns, which doesn't seem like enough.

My wallet hates me now. Last game I'll be buying in a while. Though, funnily enough, Chaos in the Old World was almost the same price. That one may have been worth it for being an awesome game, but geez, the components... at least here I get quite a bit of bang for my buck.

Hate the box. It's too big. They didn't have a bag big enough at the game store and it was raining.

Edit: This is fun. Try not to pay too much for it though... it's not *that* fun.

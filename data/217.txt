RATING: 8
This game is totally frivolous fun. And it comes with little metal frying pans! And little odd-shaped pieces of "seasonings" in little plastic jars! Yes, it's a dexterity game with a dice element AND even a little take-that, but it's a great ice breaker and a way to show the odder and more creative side of "board games" to friends and family.

The "dishes" you're making are deliberately gross and humorously illustrated, but many may find them just gross. But the act of shaking spices into a little pan on a cardboard range is too tactile to resist for most. Some of my gamer friends happily played it and had some laughs during it, but afterwards got a little snooty and dismissed it as too cheesy, but I know they had a good time. Simple to explain and multiple paths to points and victory make it juuuust deep enough.

Get the "Dessert" expansion to be able to play with five players, add another path to points, and get more spices in the mix... pun intended.

Positives
- HIGHLY tactile with metal skillets, jars of seasonings and cardboard stoves
- Multiple paths to victory
- A light game with some "meat" to it, no pun intended
- Easy to teach and quick to play

Negatives
- Lots of chance, between shaking of seasonings and dice rolls for oven adjustments
- Gross dishes are humorous for little kids, maybe, but otherwise just yuck

RATING: 8
Sorry, but if you play this and don't have any fun you are either dead or you should be! :) Whether this is a game or an activity is certainly debatable, but who cares - it's just a lot of fun. 

Unlike many dexterity games this one is balanced so even if you are one of those people born without an inner ear you can still manage to enjoy yourself with this game. The dice, the push your luck element with heating your dish, the coffee cups and your choice of dish really help even out the dexterity element that the spices and the crepe add to the overall picture. Really a perfect match I'd say. Of course it helps a great deal that the components are top notch and really make the whole experience a lot more fun that you'd ever imagine something like this should be.

I normally list silly little games like this as children's games so other people can gauge where my comments are coming from. I play a lot of kids games with my kids and many of them are excellent with kids but not something I'd play with adults. So I add the [Children's Game] header to the comments of those games so everyone knows my point of reference for my comment. For this game that header is completely unnecessary. I'd have fun playing this whether it was with adults or kids. Really a wonderful game aimed squarely at the family game category. More like something I'd expect to see from Haba or Zoch. Deserves a lot more recognition than it's getting.

RATING: 6.3
*2-4 Players

The game does sound very fun when I read about it but at the end, it's not as fun as I hope. .  When the games start, you roll the dice, see if I have enough heat or not, if not, keep rolling.  Roll 3 times and your turn is done - or, you shake the spice, make sure you've what you want at the top and hope it will fall out correctly.  Do it a few times and round end.  I'm not able to experience the excitement.

On the good side, I've to admit the components is top quality, the art is great, rule book is excellent.

Funny one. As for pretty old game, it feels very good. Mechanics interact with the theme lovely - when you're trying to season your meal and suddenly, "oh crap, too much salt in my soup", or when your pancake felt down and you pretend nothing happened, putting it again to the pan... Or when you try to cook water for 5 rounds and instead get SO MUCH COFFEE!

For a cooking game, this one hits the mark for just fun.  Not sure the game play is as much game as activity, but the experience is definitely one that leaves all players (win or lose) with funny laughs and a good time.  The game play is just long enough to avoid overstaying its welcome.

This is one of those dexterity games that feel more like an activity than a competitive game. This is because there isn't a strong sense of control and/or strategy to the dexterity element. But despite that, I found the game to be unique, immersive, and enjoyable. And the components are absolutely wonderful. 

The game should please many, as long as you don't take it too seriously and/or play it too often.

The most astonishing thing about A la Carte is that was designed 25 years ago by K. H. Schmiel, the same designer of an absolute heavy weight like Die Macher!

A la Carte is a light filler about cooking, with an over-the-top production value: thick cardboard stoves, metal cooking pans, clear plastic bottles for the ingredients... the whole thing is a gorgeous affair to look at, and my daughters were absolutely delighted at first sight!

The gameplay is light and goofy, and very fun: there is a bit of dexterity, some little luck, and many laughters!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was a game that was introduced by a friend. I was skeptical about it at first since I am not a fan of cooking and here we have a board game on cooking dishes? I was quite surprised that this was picked up by FFG. However, after playing it, we liked it so much that when we saw a copy in Germany, we bought it and with luck bought the expansion and managed to even get the promo from Germany too.

Definitely one of the games which my wife liked but the only issue is that after awhile it is sort of bland as it was more predictable how the game would go. Maybe it can be better if there are more dishes? However I am still intrigued by the game play where you have to shake the ingredient from the container into the frying pan to cook.

Initial Impression: This fun dexterity game has some really amazing quality components, to the point of being overproduced. Well worth the money though. Each game is short enough that the kids can stay focused throughout. For some reason, the girls seem to win more often than the boys.

(KIDS) The components are great, but otherwise nothing too special here.  It does seem to work really well as a family game with mixed ages.  There is a very mild dexterity element that is easily handled by just about anyone and a few decision points as the game develops.  Again, quite basic but good in a family setting.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Has some really interesting dexterity elements that have never really been done before (The flipping of the crape and the seasoning shakers).  This is a silly game that can actually be a bit mean when you can season someone's dish without their permission, or swap your oven / dish for their oven / dish. I had fun playing this, and am more than willing to play again, but its not something I would be request very often.

This is great fun and a joy to play. The crepe is my bane! The expansion offers exactly what this game needed: more recipes, secret bonuses and some fun coffee cups.

You know, there's not that awesome of a game here, but I had enough fun playing it that it deserves a decent rating.  The fun here is laughing at the other players when the spice shakers don't go their way.  Sometimes spices flood out and ruin your dish, and other times the stupid things clog and nothing comes out!  This might sound frustrating, but I found it pretty funny.

So, if you're looking for a great game, pass this one up.  If you're looking for a plain old good time though, give it a look!

RATING: 7
Look, here's the thing. Mechanically there is [i]nothing[/i] to this game. Like, literally there is nothing going on. I wouldn't even call it a dexterity game - as that implies there's some kind of physical skill you can improve at and that just isn't the case here.

But for real? This is just plain dumb fun. People's eyes light up when they see the little stoves and the little pans. And there's just so much drama and suspense when you go to season a dish - seriously, listen to the sharp intakes of breath around the table when you reach for a bottle.

There are a lot of "nothing" games out there that are just terrible wastes of your time. This, in my opinion, is not one of them. It has no pretense; it does not claim to have substance, just to provide a half an hour of gasps, laughs, and friggin' cheers when you flip those damn crepes right.

When I'm in the mood for a silly opener/closer, you can bet your ass I will always say yes to A la carte.

My rating is probably unfair; it reflects how much I want to play it, but if I was a child, I would probably rate it 8 (I did play it with children, and they were very positive towards it). And I admit that it’s a kind of fun dexterity game with euroelements thrown into it. You must put x number of ingredients by shaking the glass in a small saucepan. You then need to turn up the gas to the right temperature and you’ve made your recipe and thereby gain some points – most points after a certain amount of time wins the game. 

The flipping of the pancake is a funny element, and while it’s hard to do it gives you a nice chunk of points. The die is always a good idea in a children’s game. You use it to turn up the gas or get a coffee cup which gives some extra powerful actions; for instance you can get three extra actions, you can get a point and you can switch recipes/courses with another play (the last one being an “evil” action which can be fun against grown-ups). The components are great and the artwork is cute, and both help enhancing the gaming experience for children.

A cute "skill and action" game with well made piece count. It's one of those games that tries to stir your inner child, but at the end of the day it's probably best showing it to actual kids. Adorable and a great value...as long as you're the type to value it, and that won't apply to most of us hardcore gamers here. Excellent choice if you've got younger players in your household that love Ratatouille or Cooking Mama.

1st Edition (Yellow Box) Comments:

a la Carte is another game in the quite vast stable of strange Karl Heinz-Schmiel Moskito releases. In this particular case, players are cooks, attempting to create recipes successfully which involves shaking out the right wooden spices from the small plastic jars, and heating ones stove up to just the right temperature.

A third element in the game, the coffee circle, injects some healthy screw you into the proceedings. It involves pulling discs from a bag until a certain colour comes up. When it does, the drawer can have people pass their dishes and stoves left or right. Essentially what this means is that if you have a finished or nearly finished dish, but you don't have enough time to actually score it, then someone is probably going to try and hork it from you before your turn comes around. The stove heat up is also a potential place of hosage, as one of the six sides on the heat up results die gives you the ability to spice someone else's dish, which often results in utter disaster for them and cursing.

The game is very light, intentionally a filler, and honestly, it's all about casually flipping out spices and seeing what happens. Probably it's more of an activity than a game, though there are entertaining moments and the components are obviously fantastic, particularly for an old, self-produced game like this. I only will want to play it once in a while, so the rating has to reflect that, but I quite enjoy the total package here, carefully flipping spices, the pigs eagerly anticipating a ruined dish, the total concept and implementation here is snazzy.

2nd Edition:
For the most part, the 2nd edition of this game is very similar to the 1st, but I have to say that a few of the rough edges were sanded off, and the resulting game is better for it. While the game play here is essentially the same as the 1st, the coffee circle play has been streamlined to a small menu of special powers and the ability to do the crazier things, like passing stoves around or throwing nasty spices onto someone's finished plate has been downgraded from regular to sporadic. What this means in practice is that the new edition of the game keeps a lot of the feel of the original, but offers improved components and less chaotic play.

Other fun adds in the new edition include the crepes, which adds an additional, fun dexterity edge to the game, and the bonus that is offered for actually nailing a dish perfectly; which can become an alternative way to win the game for people who are much better at flipping spices than I am.

Essentially, nothing in the 2nd edition is going to change your mind if you weren't already a fan of the game, but for those who were, but provisionally, I think it definitely makes the game worth a second look, as I think that every change that was made was for the better, the game gains a full rating point for me over the original printing. I do miss having the Pig tile in place of the garbage can though.

Good game for my 6 y.o. who likes to play with the pieces and "cook" for me after we finish.  I wasn't too sure how well the condiment jars would work at first, but the levels remaining in each jar can influence your choice of recipe (pieces tumble out much more easily when the jar is half-empty, so overseasoning the dish seems more likely).  Very light game, fun for kids.  Can't figure out why I can make a perfect crepe in practice, but burn it every time during the game!

RATING: 5
I had no idea when I bought this that it's a dexterity game. And a pretty silly one at that. The silliest thing is that it's actually fairly difficult to judge whether players are playing fairly or not. You have to "pour" spices out of a jar, but bust must do so with one fluid motion. The rules say you can go as slow as you want, but I find that makes it far too difficult to do (and judge) fairly. Just a quick flick of the wrist I say! Anyway, what can you expect from a game with 3d stoves and pans and spice jars?

First impression: I owned the old edition for a short time, but never played it. Now it is updated with better and very nice material. But gameplay is so luckbased that i would categorize this more as a "social event" than a playable game. Nice to try it once in a while, for me not worth owning it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Don't treat this game at all seriously. If you do, it will break down more quickly than a house of cards whose support cards have just been removed. The general idea of A la carte is very appealing: you're given a mockup of a stove, a frying pan and some shakers, and are then presented with the task of preparing several dishes by combining heat and seasoning in the proper amounts. You can annoy other players by swapping stoves or shaking in some unwanted ingredients, although these events are quite rare. If you prepare a dish flawlessly meaning with the exact amount of ingredients indicated (which isn't as easy as it looks!) you get a star; get your third star and you win the game. The game also ends when you've prepared five different dishes.

As I previously indicated, there really isn't much 'game' here. The die determines nearly everything you can do, and what remains requires a little dexterity with the shakers and the frying pan (at one point you're required to flip over a pancake). This is a great game for children; alternatively you could play it when copious amounts of alcohol have been consumed so that hilarity is created more or less as you go along. It's nice to know that there is room in the library of a publisher to make such titles as this one, but on the other hand I'm a little sad that the author hasn't created a variant which makes it more challenging for the more ambitious gamers. I might get this as a gift for a gaming youngster; I will not seek out this game to play with enthusiasts. 

As a result I find it difficult to rate this title, and have decided to leave it unrated.

Looks like a kid's game (or play set), but is actually quite fun and entertaining. I don't normally like dexterity games, but this one nicely blends a hint of strategy with a heavy dose of dexterity (spicing your dishes)... but balances that dexterity with dice effects and some "take that" player interaction. So, instead of being a true dexterity game, this blends dexterity into the set of things needed to win. Nicely done.

Played with my fiancee. Thought she would love it and she did for about 5 minutes then the novelty wore off and she was asking when it was going to be over. Not really a dexterity game (aside from crepe flipping) and not really a strategic game. I might get rid of it real soon unless she starts begging to play it. I think I'd rather play Wasabi or somehow combine the two.

Some neat ideas and interesting components here. However, overall I was not impressed. In the game I played, winning seemed to be based on 40% luck, 50% dexterity, and 10% strategy. Maybe that ratio improves with further plays but one play-through was enough for me. More fun to watch than play, I think.

Great looking, but ultimately vacuous party game. Take a measure of dexterity, add some dice luck, cook for extended period...

RATING: 5
Players compete in the kitchen, trying to cook up the best dishes.  Players take turns to complete 3 actions - actions can be either attempt to turn up the heat on their stove (roll a heating die), or season their current dish (add seasoning from a jar to their pan).  If they complete a dish by having the correct seasoning/heat combination, they complete their dish and begin another one.  If they heat their stove too much, or add too much seasoning/salt to their pan, the dish is ruined and junked in the bin.  Play until one player has earned 3 chef stars (getting a dish exactly right), or completed a five dishes.  Highest points wins the game, but 3 stars trumps.  Funny party game with a pinch of dexterity and a touch of tactics - it's not all blind luck.  The 10 year anniversary edition is amazing ... fantastic components.  A great game to play with friends and family, but keep it away from the "serious" gamers.

RATING: 6
There's very little actual game here, and what little there is gets masked by the incredible bits and visual elements of the stoves, pans, and spice shakers.   The key to the success of this game is that the pieces actually succeed in  making up for the lack of gameplay.  The game was far too expensive for a while, but the FFG-distributed edition is reasonably priced, and nicely cleans up some of the rules.   Gimmicky, with a dexterity element (but not a lot of skill).

A lot more fun that it should be, due to some unique mechanisms that actually work!

Absolutely silly game but it's ok to play on certain occasions. Like all dexterity games, the fun is in trying to do some delicate manoeuvre and have it pay off (or not).

Excellent components.  

We are really ready to play this game again. Pure fun.

I am not quite sure what A la Carte is supposed to be.  It's not a strategy game, or a tactical game, or really even a dexterity game.  I'm not sure it's a game.

It's cute, and quirky - usually things I like in game design, but it offers very little in terms of actual game play.  Light would be generous.  Pick a dish, flip a jar and see what happens.

I could see children enjoying the game bits, but even they would abandon the game play and invest the components into something more imaginative and fun.

It also takes way too long.  If it lasted ten minutes - I would still struggle to like it., but it takes almost an hour to play and that is unacceptable for a game with nothing going on.  

There are so many zany, great component games out there I don't believe this is needed.  

YUCKK!!

Superb components (you need to tweak a bit, using glue), more theme than game, bits of humor and excellent use of component/mechanism interaction. Unique in my gaming experience.

The components for this one are just awesome. It doesn't get much better than this, with the plastic bottles, plastic gems, metal frying pans, thick cardboard chits and the little stoves, with temperature dials. They really did a good job on this one.

Game play is simple and a lot of fun. Check it out. This is a cool light game.

RATING: 8
It's too silly to be an absolute favorite of mine, but it is a lot of fun. The mixture of dexterity, luck, and strategy integrates surprisingly well with the theme. It really does feel like following a recipe and trying to get your seasonings just right. It's pricey considering it's basically a filler with a lot of table appeal, but it's so unlike any other game it's worth it. The giggles of delight begin during the rules explanation. What other game can say that?

Ultimately, I'm glad I have this, and it won't be leaving my collection. But I'm not sure if the amount of fun here is really worth the rules overhead, except with experienced gamers. It also works reasonably well as a kids' game, despite the ages 13+ on the box, which must only be there for legal reasons.

And there may be no other game that quite so much makes you want to jump in and participate when you see it being played.

An absolute treat (no pun intended)! This game is perfect for families looking for a great dexterity game, or a great "push your luck" game, or a great components game! We had a blast playing this- although, the allowable spice shaker positions proved more challenging than I thought for my 7 year old. He did manage to get it right after some practice and everything was perfect from then on!

A game of dexterity where you shake bottles of spice but beware... if you over spiced your dish you get 0 points as customers are not happy that you met their pallet! 

The game involves shaking mini shakers. Think salt and pepper jars/shakers. There are few tiny gemstones in it but included in them are black ones too. Shake too little, no spice comes out. Shake too much the black gemstones count as overspicing things up. 

A fun game for family but not something I like to keep in my collection

RATING: 6
A mildly amusing game requiring some dexterity and plenty of finesse. The components are very well done, making one feel like they are a chef working in the kitchen. All players are racing to complete a specific number of "recipes", each requiring a specific blend of "seasonings" and "temperature" settings. Each player has three actions: they can roll a die to randomly raise or lower the "heat" setting on a 3D cardboard representation of a stovetop burner, take one "shake" from a seasoning shaker, or invoke a "coffee break" action.

The most entertaining aspect of the game is the shake action, where a player will shake a spice shaker that contains gem-like crystals. None, one, or several of these crystals may pop out into a frying pan, which is where you are trying to season your dish. Too much seasoning and the dish is ruined. Too much heat and the dish is burned. If you season it perfectly and heat it perfectly, you get VP. There is also a recipe that requires a player to successfully flip a circular cardboard representation of a "crepe" to get 5 VP. It's cute and a quick way to pass the time. I rate it a '6'.

A La Carte is a very creative game. The game is focusing on cooking in the kitchen. Players choose a dish from the menu. According to the recipe, players put seasons and control the temperature, then finally make a succesful special food. The game is composed of cute and attractive kitchen utensils which reminds playing house in childhood. Surely, the game is simple. Thus, it is certain that A La Carte is a party game. In spite of weak of game elements, A La Carte bring back old memories to players. Considering the sensibility of the game, A La Carte can be treated as a nice game. It is worthy of possession.

Hah! Who would of thought this from the creator of Die Macher! 

REALLY great components and believe me I don’t care about such things but in this case I think it adds an extra point to my rating because they are necessary for the type of game it is (spices and cooking).  

A very novel and ambitious concept, excellent game for what it was designed to do, basically hit the lighter audience with a fun game and wow them with the components.  Really not much of a game though when you get down to it, almost no decisions to make, kind of more of a dexterity game and that isn’t a bad thing really, its pretty nifty trying to get just one spice out of the container (great component design there) and trying to flip your crepe.  

Downtime is a bit of a killer here and well luck kind of bites too but in lieu of the game and time to play, the downtime is the bigger issue.

It's been a long time since I last played A la Carte so I don't remember much. I remember the game was very different from what I have played at the time. The components are great.

I would like to play the game again and when I do I will come back and re comment.

2016-07-11 - This is basically a dexterity game where you are pouring ingredients into a pan, hoping to not pour too much so you don't ruin the dish. It's a fun silly game, but I'm not sure how much replayability there really is.

A fun enough game to play with your kids (ignore the manufacturer's 13+ rating). I'm not a fan of dexterity games, but A la Carte does come with lovely toy frying pans and little flat pack hobs which add to the fun. Try to season your dishes right by tipping the right number of plastic things into your frying pan. Just don't get me started on flipping crepes!

Very fun theme, which makes the game for me.  In reality, there's very little game here, it's half dexterity (though completely unskilled/luck-based dexterity) and half luck (die rolls or random draw from a bag).  For me the fun comes from the bits (little frying pan and paper stove) and the cooking theme, which is very underutilized.  I think that a game like Leonardo da Vinci would be way better with a cooking theme than an inventing one.  It's also a little confrontational, which could put people off.  As long as the game is quick, I would always be very happy to play.

A great upgrade.  I was happy playing the old version, but they did a great job with this reissue - the components are wonderful, the changes made to the gameplay are all positive, especially the coffee klatsch thing, which I never really liked.

Rounded up  for components.

This can be fun. Or it can be boring as hell. It all depends on whom you play this with. 

You can't be sure unless you play it with them.
For that reason I won't be tempted to take it with me.

Some coffee breaks are overpowered. And by overpowered I really mean overpowered. Since you get them by chance the game is 95% luck; 4% dexterity and 1% skill

Some sweet game components in this one with miniature frying pans and stoves...:-)  Basically, every person is either trying to steal someone else's recipe, shake spices creating your own recipe (and hopefully avoiding too much of a spice or salt), or trying to heat up the stove to higher temperatures.  Good creations score you points; overcooked or overspiced creations get dumped to the pigs and score you a negative point.  Lighthearted fun!

This game reminds me of the wonderful variety in our hobby.  There is real humour in the game without becoming slapdash and it has a clever mechanism which is in-line with the theme and adds a new approach or 'spice' (pun intended - my apologies) to a set collection game.  Furthermore, it is obvious that there has been significant care and attention paid to the quality of the components.  From my perspective, however, gameplay lacked a little and did not match the set-up or concept of the game.  I was never in a position where I was in danger of burning my food and with my dice roles was not given the opportunity to meddle with other players recipes - where the true delight comes in the game.  Therefore my suggestion would be to use a die with more sides with an increased ratio of Meddling sides and possibly even a -1 option on the die.

played it in hong kong essen 2009 and both me and my gf liked it v.much. Simple mechanic, attractive theme and good props make this game a solid A+ :>

haha.. for attractiveness, i imply to new gamers and girls 

couldn''t resist to buy it....
played with family and my mum liked it alot.
i''m delighted to hear my mum say: "can we play this again" at the end of the game :> (however my dad think it is too chidish with little interaction)

Played steadily, this game never outstays its welcome. 

Calling it a true dexterity game is probably a stretch, and it's really more of a social experience than anything.

In any case, it's wonderful for the occasional play.

RATING: 6
A fun, dexterity game that is intended for familites and kids.  The components are clever with stoves, little pans and spice shakers.  They looks like toys kids may play with as part of a kitchen.  This is a game that will make you smile.  

"Serious" gamers may not find this fun as it does have dose of luck in whether the salt falls out.  But it will make your kids happy and that is very much worth it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is great fun as a light dexterity game.  The shakers at least present the illusion of some control, if not actual control.  Not the kind of strategy game you'd expect from the designer of Die Macher, but that's not a bad thing here.  The components are amazing.

RATING: 6.8
A game of drunk, pissed-off chefs creating strange dishes and taking out their frustrations on the other chefs in the kitchen.

A few too many dips into the cooking sherry apparently results in the completely random setting of the cooking temperatures and since they can't find the salt shaker may as well store that salt in with the other spices.

Anger over the other cooks failing to refill the coffee pot forces the chefs to take drastic measures against the others such as taking over someones master creation and getting the glory for it while leaving them the steaming mess you just piled 4 tablespoons of pepper onto.

No need for annoying trips to the grocery store because you'll scrape off those herbs and spices into the sink and reuse them later.

Oddities aside this game was good silly fun and I enjoy bragging about my crepe flipping skills.

Fantastic looking components make this hands-down one of the most thematic games there is, however, it feels like the only dexterity game that I've played at which you could make the accusation of randomness; when pouring tiny plastic pieces out of a jar it is simply too difficult to make any accurate predictions.

I'll keep this for a while, because I may yet be proven wrong about the randomness (isn't that always the excuse when people lose their first game?), and my girls love playing with the pieces (even if they're not playing the game).

A fun game. Not very deep, but that doesn't matter because it's just plain fun. Shaking in the seasoning and flipping the crepes makes for an exciting tactile experience. 

Here's a tip: Don't play this a bunch of times in a row. Use it as a filler game before or after a heavier game.

Bought it for my son, as he loves to cook.  He seems to enjoy it, and it has some fun elements to it.  Not a lot of strategy; basically picking the easiest dishes that yield the most points \ rewards.  Rest of the game is pretty much dexterity, but not a lot to it.

The components are really nice, and feel fun to hold \ play with, such as the spice jars, and the little stoves.  I guess it feels more like a toy, than a game.

This classic party game has been remade, and how!

It's not a deep game, it's silly fun. And thanks to the beautiful components and odd gameplay it's really something different. Thumbs up.

Played it with 5 (!!!) at Essen after getting the game explained by Karl-Heinz Schmiel himself in full cook's outfit was quite nice too.

Awesome components and a mechanic that has you shaking spices from a spice jar.  As a cook you try to complete your entree by adding the correct spices & the correct heat to your dish.  Meanwhile, ruin your opponents' dishes so that it's only suitable for the pigs.

I'd play this from time to time.  It's a light tactical game with a dash of dexterity & a ladle of luck.

Really wonderful family game. It's got some basic logic and strategy, but the meat and potatoes of the game is a dexterity bit that puts the kids on an even field with the adults - shaking salt shakers in an attempt to get the colored bits out without the salt coming out. There's a bit of randomness with the die rolls used to heat your stove, and a bit of take-that with the coffee cups that let you season another player's dish or trade stoves with them.

Our 6-year old regularly wins at this. It's silly fun.

I was curious about how this one would work. After one play my curiosity is satisfied such that I won't be buying this game.  The game comes with great components including metal frying pans but that is not enough to make this a good game.  There is no strategy, just the "dexterity" aspect of trying to get the right amount of ingredients to fall into your pan.  A clever idea but it just doesn't work, not even as a party game.

In "a la Carte" sind die Spieler Küchenchefs, die sich an kullinarischen Gerichten probieren wollen. Für jedes Gericht gibt es Siegpunkte und eventuell sogar einen Stern, wenn es ganz besonders gut gelungen ist. A la Carte ist erst einmal ein optischer Eye-Catcher, denn das Spielmaterial ist erste Sahne. Jeder Spieler hat einen kleinen Papp-Herd und eine große Plastikpfanne vor sich stehen. In der Mitte stehen kleine Plastikgefäße, gefüllt mit bunten "Gewürz"-Plastik-Knubbeln :-) A la Carte ist ein reines Geschicklichkeitsspiel. Es geht kaum um Taktik. Die Regeln sind mehr als einfach und so entpuppt sich A la Carte als perfektes Familienspiel, was man aber auch mit Vielspielern spielen kann, wenn diese sich auf so ein witziges und unkompliziertes Spiel einlassen können.

A delightful cooking-themed dexterity game where you basically tip plastic crystals out of small jars into a pan. That makes it sound lame, its really not!

Take turns to try and add just the right amount of ingredients to your pan and get the heat to the right temperature to complete your dish. Sounds so simple but its really not!

Love the incredible production quality that really makes this game thematically fun! Real little cooking pans, 3D stoves and little jars of plastic crystal 'ingredients'.

The Dessert expansion that adds salty dishes and an extra player is a must have.

A la Carte is a light dexterity/family game in which the players are chef's who need to add the right spices to each dish and get the heat on their stove just right to complete dishes and earn points. 

The dexterity element comes in via the flicking action needed to get spice gems out of the jars and the flipping of craps in the frying pans.

The game is gorgeous to look at and play with thanks to some wonderful 3D components. 

A splash of luck is also introduced via the dice rolling heat mechanic and the Coffee Cup abilities that are collected. 

It's a light experience and perfect for families. For the harder core gaming market their isn't too much here to hold one's interest for too long. I like to play it every few months with the right group. 

The expansion is a nice to have but not essential.

I love cooking so A la carte's theme definitely adds to the appeal for me. It's a wonky and completely unserious cook-fest that will appeal to non-gamers, children and more serious gamers (when in a slightly less serious mode) - but doubtless the lack of strategic depth and amount of luck will repel some. The production value is great, cooking pans and stoves (although the outting together the stoves is a pain). A la carte lacks the high-pressure and comeptitive environment of a real kitchen - but as a short and strictly for fun excercise A la carte delivers. Stealing of the pans and destrying other chefs' plates adds a twang of viciousness for those so inclined.

This is a cooking game where you have a hot plate that you pour ingredients into and get to a certain temperature to cook dishes worth points.  The ingredient jars a bit finicky in that you will never know how many will come out, if at all.  

A good gimmicky game for a play or two, but the ingredient jars are just too impeding on the fun for me to want to own this.  I am sure it is great for kids, although frustration could still be apparent.

And by the time they reached that age, they'd want to play something else, something cooler.

The new edition has gorgeous components. The spice randomizers are a unique idea, and very well executed. The gameplay could use more silliness, complexity or preferably both. In the current form, it's somewhat mechanical and repetitive, and not that satisfying as a game. There's not enough hilarity either to qualify this as a party game, but the game works very well as a quick filler.

Light little filler dexterity game about cooking. Incredible production quality for such a silly game. It includes 3D stoves made from very heavy chipboard, and the game includes metal cooking pans. The seasoning bottles are clear plastic and the seasonings are colored plastic gems.

There is a tiny bit of tactical play, but most of the game revolves around the dexterity skill of seasoning your recipe. Although, players can occasionally screw each other through use of one of the coffee breaks, which are acquired randomly.

It's a unique game, that I have had on my wishlist for a long time. Overall, it's a great little game. Watching eurogamers oversalt their food is a hoot!

A la carte is a blast! The components of this game are incredible! This game may just be a toy! I believe the simple plastic spice containers are the heart of this game! You can shake once...and no spice...repeat...and 6 spice pieces shoot out onto your recipe and it's ruined! You see, your spicing can never go to three of any color, or you have ruined your recipe! This game makes you feel like a beginner cook for the first time or all over again!

Each person begins with a stove and pan! The game is very simple...season or turn up the heat on the stove to complete the recipe! But do not over season or over heat...beware! The recipes are humorous in that they are really bizarre and unappetizing! Whenever you finish a recipe, you feel like...what in the world did I just make? Thematically, it all makes perfect sense!

A cute game with great components.  Nothing really wrong with this one, it just is not my type of game.  The ingredient flicking is surprisingly a skill you can definitely master, which makes the game a bit more interesting to me.  This is probably worth trying with Kristen and my parents, I think they would actually have a lot of fun here.

RATING: 5
A game that's 90% components and 10% game-play, setting a new benchmark (for Euros) in high-end over-production in order to disguise frailties. Pick a menu card that says how many of what coloured crystals you need to complete it. Shake and turn over bottles containing said crystals and have a random number come out. Too many, too bad. Too few, try again. Just right? Carry on with the next bottle you need. Throw in some dice rolling to increase the randomness to get your temperature gauge right. Add a bunch of pus cards to ramp up the chaos factor further. Finally, complete the game with a tile flipping exercise for enough victory points to win the game if you’re anywhere nearabouts. By the end, I was hoping one of the cardboard stoves provided would ignite and set fire to the whole thing. I didn't mind playing it once because there was fun in exploring it, but I can't find a reason for playing it again. The game is just a random experience. If I wanted that, I'd play a ride game with a theme that provided interest, or something short that generated shared laughs and groans.

RATING: 5
A dexterity game where dexterity is largely irrelevant. Unlike a game like Crokinole or Pitch Car or Jenga your dexterity has little determination on the game. You tip over some jars of "spices" (plastic odd-shaped pieces) and try to get them into your pan. The dexterity element is supposed to be you only get one tip of the jar and you only get a certain amount of tips to get the spices to come out. Sometimes they just don't come out, sometimes a bunch come out. It seems largely based on chaos theory and luck, and one's dexterity is irrelevant, which is sort of a spoiler. The one true element of dexterity in this game (and the one fun part about it) is if you decide to cook a crepe you have to flip it out of your pan and catch it in the pan on the other side. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
(1 play)  A little too frustrating.  The strategy lies in selection of recipe, and everything else is fairly random.  It's a cute and fun game, but it's a little too complicated to be "light" and too random to enjoy the strategy.  The "dexterity" part has little to do with dexterity.  The pieces jam in the jars really easily, and no talent or finesse is going to loose them.

RATING: 6
A rare thematic dexterity game where most of the humour is from the seasoning action ("Grr no pepper!!!" or "aaah, too much!!"), though the die roll which turns up the heat of everyones stove can lead to your opponent(s) burning their dish. Then things get Gordon Ramsey nasty if a player decides to swap pans or season an opponents dish. So not a game to take too seriously or feelings may get burnt. However, the game does have some probability assessment in deciding which allowable dish to do next and which seasoning will increase your chance of getting a star. I like the alternate victory condition of 3 stars being an outright win as it provides hope if behind on victory points/dishes.

Unfortunately, I feel the components actually diminishes the experience as the pans obscure the contents so you can't relate effectively: it is unclear what the others need and so can't tune into (and laugh at) their joy or pain. It really needs this extra layer to add to the fun. This was especially the case playing with 3 other cooks, so I suspect players need to commentate and ham it up to get the belly wobbling  or maybe it is best as a 2 player seated side by side (a la Masterchef).

Ruined by the "switch your pan&stove with another player" Coffee Cup-tokens. Those tokens can effectively make you lose two previous turns(six actions) if you are making a valuable food that requires many spices. Totally unnecessary part of the game that should be removed, even worse if you use the token against children and ruin their game.

A fun and light hearted dexterity game spiced with a little screw-your-neighbour...

You are a cook and try to create different dishes by "shaking" colored ingredients out of plastic containers and heating up your pan. But to much heat or ingredients and your dish is ruined...

It is easy enough for kids and non-gamers to get into, but has enough going on to be a nice filler for our group. The components are awesome looking and the dexterity elements are really unique in our collection! It's just a fun time and recommended

A unique tactile/thematic experience. 

It's a dexterity game, unlike any other. It's an euro (of sorts). A really immersive experience - you're a cook, with your pan, your stove and then you try to make recipes. Which involve some dexterity skills (and luck) and some die rolling. 

Similarly to Rampage/Terror in Meeple town it's all about how theme and tactile level of the game blend together seamlessly. It's really all about the ride and enjoying the fun of it. On the minus side - there is a lot of components and some can be easily lost (though extras come in the box. still not best for public gaming events). Surprisingly all the boys (9-12 y.o.) we tried this with really enjoy it. (which is good news).

This ranks high as one of my favorite light games.  This is probably too long as a filler (if played with three rounds), but it is a great closer.  The crazy thing about the game is that, for as random everthing is, there really is some tactical control.

Light and silly, this game is just chock full of goofy fun.  There is a little bit of a dexterity element (although, not really), but random spice generators (aka, bottles) keeps people actively involved.

Many laughs are had as you balance screwing your fellow players and trying  not to feed your dishes to the pigs. The game would work out fine with just one round, though, but chances are you will want to play more.

The strategy is almost nonexistent here, but great components and a relatively quick playing time make it a decent game to play once or twice.

Well, the production of this game is absolutely gorgeous and spectacular. 
As a strategic experience this game obviously doesn't work at all. It's not its goal. Its goal is to provide fun and a good time (30/40 minutes) of play. The result in the end is the least important because everybody should have liked the experience of playing it.

I'm very happy that I've boughten "A La Carte" in Essen and I admit that I bought it for my daughter mainly because of the production but the game itself is also a good valid reason to buy it.

The toy factor on this one is through the roof. The game feels a little bit like playing "kitchen" with young children, but it's a unique experience and, more importantly, great fun. The interactive cards make it possible to sabotage your opponent's dishes meaning it's almost impossible to finish every meal that you start, but this game is more about the experience than actually winning. An essential game for families, A la carte offers a flavor of game you can't quite get anywhere else.

Ridiculous game that defies categorization -- if you thought it was annoying to roll a bunch of dice and get a bad result, just wait until you have to flick a tiny bottle to shake a plastic rock of "paprika" into your miniature saucepan. Or use said saucepan to flip a pancake token. 

Rated a 6 because I would not want to play it frequently, but it's a great gaming experience: dexterity, luck, a bit of strategy, and the best components [i]ever[/i].

[Heidelberger Spieleverlag 2009 edition] {Cooking, gateway, family; dexterity; scalable}  A la carte is a thematic family game with nice theme and simple rules. It's particularly good for children and girls.  Decisions are simple: choosing which dish to finish and which way to win (collecting stars / victory points).  Player interaction is nice with the coffee cup and dice; there are minor take-that factors.  However, the game play is not particularly fun.  Nonetheless, it's still a good gateway game to attract new players.

The components are absolutely stunning: thematic, colorful, nice graphics and sturdy.

Seems a bit convoluted for what it is. The dexterity stuff is somewhat fun, but the game itself isn't great. Too fiddly considering that at the end of the day it comes down to dice and a more or less random shake of the spices. Still, the production is cool.

A combination of party/dexterity game with super-cool components and interesting, even a bit original gameplay, but sadly the end result is mostly luck-based and not much fun once you get past the originality (ie. after the first 1 or 2 plays).

As a dexterity game, there's just not much here.  The physical motions in A La Carte are limited to shaking spices and flipping an omelette.  The components are gorgeous but without them, there wouldn't have been anything to publish.  Despite that, it's a silly crowd-pleaser.

Played at Essen Spiel 2009. Nice push your luck game with a small component of dexterity (although it is probably more luck than skill). Not enough depth. Really good looking components and a lot of stuff included, but most of that is not actually used for the game and more decoration of the gaming table...

A decent dexterity game, with a welcoming theme. I would say it's very good for kids, while still works well for adults. If you want a cute dexterity game with top-notch components, give this one a serious look.

RATING: 6
This is an initial rating.  I was drawn to the game by the theme and components, but I wasn't especially impressed with my first play with three.

I'll need to try this again.

Update:  Still a 6. Played again with four, three adults and a 9-year old.  It was better, but I still am not impressed with the play.  Yet I still want to save this to play with my daughter who is now only 14 months old.  I am sick.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4

Overall - 1.5

I mistakenly thought that this was a new Karl-Heinz Schmiel game in my previous Boardgame News column, but as someone thankfully pointed out, this is actually a reprint of a game that's 20 years old. Albeit a reprint with definitely improved components, from the looks of the photographs of the older version. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try A La Carte at BGG.CON in Dallas because it turns out that Schmiel really can design games across the spectrum, from heavyweights like Die Macher, to middle-weights like Extrablatt, and now to light-weights like A La Carte, which is a very fun and very silly filler. It's got a dash of dexterity and pinch of decision-making, which combine to make a fantastic recipe. It's good enough to even merit importing from Germany assuming it doesn't eventually get a U.S. release.

Unusual mechanic, some dexterity kind of interferes with other aspects of the game. Not sure how much I like it, might try again. Played with Shellie & Al, their daughter really liked it. It is, after all, a kid's game. Great bits but won't get lots of play in an adult only environment.

In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!

We bought this game for our niece and nephew, because we wanted to play but didn't really want to keep it. It's a fun game, and I really enjoyed playing it but I would never play it without the kids involved. It definitely does not have a large replay value but a great game for kids. Even they though were more interested in other games we had!

Totally unique in both theme and mechanics. More fun than perhaps it has any right to be. Is it a dexterity game? I'm not sure is shaking the spice jar is capable of being influenced by technique any more than rolling a die is. Real decisions or control may be sparse, but it is such a joy to play that it doesn't matter.

Okay, it's pretty, but the game suuuuuuucks.  The decisions to be made are trivial.  There's a dexterity element, but I didn't see our group getting any better at it as the game progressed, which makes me think that it's just a randomizer in the guise of dexterity.  There's no disputing that the components in this game are fantastic, but there's just no worthwhile game here.  It's not quite as brainless as the worst children's games, but it's close.

RATING: 5
This is a game that's convoluted, fiddly, full of a lot of moving parts, and prone to a great deal of randomness.  The bits are cute, and there's no denying that a game that relies on being able to flip a crepe correctly wins a few points in any gamer's book, but the sum of all those parts is a game that takes far too long, and just isn't all that interesting.  I get that it's a kids' game, but with all the rules to remember, they're hardly going to get much more out of it than flipping pancakes and shaking spice bottles.

Ένα παιχνίδι μαγειρικής για 2-4 παίχτες.
Διάρκειας 30 λεπτών.
Στον γύρο σου ξόδεψε τα 3 action σου για να φτιάξεις την συνταγή σου.
Αν την φτιάξεις σωστά κερδίζεις ένα χρυσό αστέρι του chef.
Με 3 αστέρια μπορείς να κερδίσεις το παιχνίδι ή αλλιώς με 5 διαφορετικές συνταγές.
Πρόσεχε γιατί αν αργήσεις να φτίξεις την συντάγη μπορεί ο αντίπαλος σου να στην χαλάση είτε με παραπάνο υλικά είτε με το να σου ανεβάση την θερμοκρασία και να σου κάψει το φαγητό.

Dexterity! Sort-of.
Random chance.
Tiny bit of push your luck.
Light weight (1).
Low-medium player interaction. It's not often, but it can sting.
Medium theme application.

So playing A La Carte can be an exercise in random elements just not going your way, primarily in tipping the ingredients bottles but you know what? It just doesn't matter. The game is so much fun and bad luck happens to everyone. You're just as likely to make two perfect dishes in a row as pour a ton of salt into your pan.

Exceptional components add +10 to charm and it's just such a delightful game to play, a game that truly [b]looks[/b] good when it's going.

For the enthusiasts, a little piece of trivia: the game's designer Karl-Heinz Schmiel also designed Tribune: Primus Inter Pares and... wait for it... Die Macher XD What a brilliant guy!

Played a few times so far with games of 3 and 4 players. Fun dexterity/filler game with a goofy, entertaining cooking theme. This is the sort of game that shouldn't take itself seriously, and it doesn't, which is nice. 

Makes for an entertaining family game, particularly if you are playing with people who can laugh at themselves for not being able to flip a cardboard crepe or shake out plastic spice chunks successfully. I can see this aspect possibly being frustrating for some (younger?) players as you are likely to have some turns where you don't accomplish anything other than making other players laugh at your inability. 

We had a good enough time that everyone wanted to play again after the first game. Looks to be a winner for us.

A la Carte is a fun family dexterity game. It's very light, and even young children can play with skill - in fact they tend to do better than grownups in my experience.

However, the game is longer than its listed 30 minutes. Our games, take around tends to take around 45 minutes, but it's still fun, if everyone stays on target. Most of our games have been with 4 or 5 players (with the Dessert expansion).

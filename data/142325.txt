I love Kobayakawa for what it is: a very fast, streamlined bidding game that takes some deduction, bluffing, and luck. The box is super tiny, and I like that also - it makes for the perfect game to bring to a bar or coffee shop if you have a few to play with.

Kobayakawa is basically the same as the infamous War except for that you do not know the cards others have before you have decided to stay in by betting for the round. There is some room for bluffing when you are given the opportunity to change the cards but this aspect of the game is very limited. The game has 15 cards with values 1-15. Hence with greater player numbers you can be fairly sure that both the lowest and highest cards have appeared in someone’s hand which kind of narrows down number of playable hands. Thus it rarely makes sense to bid if the value of your card is 13 or less. The good thing is that the game only last for a predefined number of rounds and cannot run forever, and thus I could play although there is not too much game in this.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

This is one of my few tentatives to enter the world of micro-games... and now I know that I don't really care for them.  

The look of the game - while so simple - is surprisingly pleasing, but the "game-play" is unbelievably shallow. I don't understand how someone would like to play Kobayakawa a couple of times in a row over playing once any other card game that actually has something to it. If it's for time purposesor to kill a couple of minutes, I would rather just have a conversation.

I don't hate Kobayakawa. Just I don't see the point in playing it. I guess that simply micro-games are not my cup of tea.

A simple game. Cool. Like the other japanese games, its simple and fast.

here we have a warfare game, with a good level of tactics. Need more plays to master this one.

Very light bluffing game, with trace amounts of Blackjack in its DNA.

This game is probably going to feel too light to a lot of people, but I feel that if one is looking for a filler that feels familiar, yet is easy to teach to non-gamers, this is a perfect fit.

This game manages to capture the essence of poker in a quick time frame and with minimal components. By paying attention to what cards have been played, the players' decisions, and who decided to bet... you end up with a good amount of information to deduce player's hands. Overall, the game feels refreshing and innovating.

I like it quite a bit.

This was the first game from Oink Games that I bought. I don't know what it was about it, but something just sounded really fun, so I decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did because it turned me on to a great game design company (I now own pretty much everything they've produced which is not out of print), and also set me off on a Japanese game collecting adventure! 

Kobayakawa itself is just a fantastic, easy to learn, quick to play card / betting game. It's like a super stripped down version of Poker or Blackjack...best hand wins, but with a twist! Pick it up!!

this is a very quick playing easy to learn fun game, about on the same scale as Love Letter although a bit more strategic also with the option to bet or not if the luck of the draw does not favor you. I'm surprised with how popular Love Letter is this one doesn't get as much attention (and I say this even for myself since I rate LL higher) especially with being able to play up to 6... maybe if it had characters instead of just numbers on the cards? I have had a lot of people have difficulty reading the numbers in this actually so I've learned to always go over them before hand with new players.

Petit jeu minimaliste japonais. vraiment minimalisme. Une quinzaine de cartes (de 1 à 15). A chaque tour, on a une carte. Soit on la remplace, soit on remplace la carte centrale. Puis on lance les paris. Celui qui aura la carte la plus haute gagne. Mais celui avec la carte la plus basse rajoute la carte centrale (et donc peut gagner). A priori, il faut plutôt y jouer à 5-6 que à 3

I need more strategy in my games.   There is a small amount to be gained by what players in front of you do in terms of draw/bidding.  But ultimately this game should be "pick a number between 1-10...closest to what i have wins".  On the plus side, the metal coins are cool.  Unfortunately, it is wasted on this abstract guessing game.

An ultra-light minimalist bluffing game from Oink.  Very fast and a nice opener/closer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The Oink edition has a really nice aesthetic, as is typical for their productions.   The game itself is a microgame that boils down to one-card poker.   There is a small twist where the player with the lowest card who hasn't folded gets to add the central card to their total.   It's fast and painless but vapor thin.   Rules ambiguities may need to be house ruled.   Do you have to discard before drawing?  If you don't discard, are you forced to then flip, or can you do nothing on your turn?

RATING: 4
A very light bidding game, with simple rules and simple choices. It is very interesting that players must choose between drawing a new card and replacing the Kobayakawa. This gives players two very different means of controlling their odds of victory. Generally, if you hold a high or low card its in your best interest to deflate the Kobayakawa, but if you are stuck in the middle its best to draw and hope for the high- or low-card. The strangest part of this game, is that one player folding could prevent another player from winning, which is a bit counterintuitive for a bidding game.

A cute end-of-night filler that has some cleverness with how you play cards. Rather than just highest card wins, here the player with the lowest card adds that value to the card face up in the center, and the other players simply use face value of their card. How close to the bone can you cut it?

Another minimalist game of bluff from Japan, this one has a bag of metal coins too. Very simple mechanism made us think it was too basic at first. But on our second play, we broke into different tactics, and the game improved! I've had this several times with Japanese games. Euro players are so used to complex mechanisms, when they play a game with almost nothing to it, they think it's a game with nothing. But these games take a few plays to reveal themselves.

Kobayakawa is a very enjoyable take on poker style games.  I like how the game changes very quickly depending on what the top card is on the discard pile.  When you have a low card, you're rooting for a 15 to be on the pile but, when you're the one with the 15, you're hoping that one shows up on the pile.  A good game that gets better with more players.

Potentially fun bluffing game that is decided too much by luck. In my only game I never got a card which would have won me a single round. Maybe, I could have bluffed a player into not bidding and won a round but I never had a chance to win the game with those cards.

Still, the poker-inspired gameplay has some appeal and might work out better in another play. The game is quick enough that I would give it a second chance.

A nice quick filler. There's a fair amount of luck I suppose, and some advantage to the person going last on the very last round due to a doubling of bets. (I'm pretty sure that's how I managed to win. I was either the second to last or last player, can't remember now at the moment).

An excellent little filler though.

Overall, Kobayakawa is pretty solid! I think as far as light bluffing games I probably prefer things like Cake Duel, but I don't think this is a bad game to pack with you if you are playing with more people than the two that Cake Duel allows for! It's short, light, and easy to play, and it's pretty fun! I'd say it falls well within the bandwidth of the Oink Games line, and if you're looking to add it to your collection, it's not a bad pick!

I wouldn't be surprised if Kobayakawa was based on a traditional card game, as it is a fun betting / bluffing game and its scoring mechanism would make sense if the game was played for money for hours. However in this context the scoring mechanism doesn't work: the game is too short to let skill play an important role and players can find themselves playing several rounds knowing that they can't win the game.

Ein reines Bluffspiel. 
Jeder Spieler erhält eine Karte und eine liegt offen in der Mitte. Reihum darf sich nun jeder entscheiden die Karte in der Mitte mit einer vom Stapel zu ersetzen oder die vom Stapel gezogene Karte auf die Hand zu nehmen. Wird sie auf die Hand genommen muss er eine der beiden Handkarten nun offen vor sich auslegen.
Nachdem alle Spieler das getan haben folgt eine weitere Runde, in der alle Spieler entscheiden ob sie noch im Siel sind (und 1 Münze in den Pot schieben) oder aussteigen. Wer von den Mitspielenden nun die höchste Karte auf der Hand hält, gewinnt den gesammten Pot (+ 1 Münze von allg. Vorrat). Aber Achtung, derjenige mit der geringsten Zahl, darf zu seiner noch die offene Karte in der Mitte hinzuaddieren. Aus einer mickrigen 4 Kann mit der Kartenmitte schonmal eine 17 werden...

I played this at the Tokyo Game Market on April 28th, 2013 at the Demo table and bought it straight away, as did all my friends who played it.  Then when my other friends came, we went to the demo table again, and everyone also wanted to buy a copy.  Such a great filler, easy to teach, creative, and such a simple game but who knew it would be so much fun!!!  The art is awesome.  I bought 3 copies.  I can't stop thinking about this game :)
After 5 plays: Still love this game.  I can't stop betting all my money away.  I'm liking this more and more as I play it.

Great filler game.  A simple design that manages to create tense betting situations.  The highest total wins, but the lowest card combines with the common card in the middle, so every decision that another player makes can impact your own.  

I like For Sale more, and it would be easy to play this with 1 suit of a standard deck of cards and 1 other Ace and a Joker (because this game is 1-15), but it's a great alternative filler for a decent price.  I would get this over Love Letter, for instance, because Love Letter only works well with 3 or 4 players, whereas this game works with 3-6, and at 3 better than Love Letter, imo.

It can suffer from the last round of betting being an all or nothing or perhaps a person being eliminated before that round, but it's a quicker game than a first to 4 of Love Letter.

Not much of a game, but just enough to pleasantly pass time. The short decision space means players aren't too terribly invested in what happens, yet when the big reveal happens there's real potential for upsets and laughs. A clever, minimalist design that feels more like a gambling game than bluffing or strategy one.

RATING: 6
Have to play a few more times before deciding if this is more luck based than what I had originally hoped for.

You essentially are trying to be the highest scorer for the round with 15 cards numbered 1-15.  The trick is that the person with the lowest card gets to add the turned over card in the middle of the table to their score...highest wins.  On your turn you either flip a new card for the center of the table...or draw a new card for yourself and that is it!

Quick game that will be played more before deciding on it.

Good game, it is like a variant on poker, has interesting mini choices, but that is it. it is too little of a game.

An interesting and original game that's not really attractive at all. And I don't mean the visuals, but the logic of the game - it's not evident and can be groupthink driven, so the group really has to play it a few times to see how everything works. 

It's kinda a micro game meet No Thanks, but plays kinda unique. A betting(bluffing/pushing your luck mix. 

You need to develop the proper dynamic for the game: some people going for high cards, some for low cards, a bit of doubt which is which. And a runaway leader can end the game prematurely. When it works it's neat - but you have to "cultivate" the group to get there.  

If I find a group for it, rating might go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played once with 4P. A light game of bluffing and betting. A round of the game consists of players starting with a card in hand, and a card placed at the centre of the table. Players take turns to either draw a card and discard a card, or to exchange the value of the card in the centre with a random value. Each player then bets on whether they will have the highest valued card remaining in hand. The trick is that the value of the centre card is added to the lowest valued card, so even if you have a low value in hand, you may still have a shot at winning. Rinse and repeat for 8 rounds.

Kobayakawa requires a good deal of luck to do well. If the value at the centre of the table is high, it is often better to hold on to smaller values than large ones, although a change in the centre value can completely change the outcome of a round. Very quick and very light, Kobayakawa is the party game among microgames.

RATING: 5
This 15 card game has an interesting mechanism where you're trying to have the highest card... unless you have the lowest card, in which case you add your card with the community card.  Seeing your opponents' discards can give you some clues as to their hands but, in the end, this is a gambling game.

1 play, 3er

This is sort of like hold'em poker, with ante and bluffing and some public/private info, but quicker and simpler. You can see people discarding a card, and have to wonder: is that player discarding a 13 'cause he has a 15, or is he holding the 1 and banking on adding the 14 in the center to his value? Not much control, seemingly, and kind of random. I won the first few hands and just passed the rest of the game to avoid losing money -- but we may have played with the wrong rules. 

Cute, but not great. Of course, fillers will rarely (if ever) rate higher than a 7 for me since I prefer meatier games.

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
The deck of cards is numbered 1-15. Players each get one card, and one card is face up in center. Each hand is once around, with 7(?) hands in the game. 

On your turn, either:
- draw a card and add it to your hand, then play one of you cards face up in front of you.
OR
- flip the top card of the deck and place item the face up card in center.
Then, players may ante a chip or pass, and bank adds one chip (in final round, 2 chips each). All players still in reveal their hold card (put it face up, covering the card in front of you, if any). The player with the lowest card adds its value to the card face up in the center, while the other players simply use face value of their card. The player closest to 15 (ties resolved by seating order, closest to dealer being better) wins the pot! 

Most money at end wins.

Played using a No Thanks deck and tokens. We used 3-17 instead of 1-15 and it seemed to work fine. The game seemed okay but I'm sure it would be much better with four or more players. With just three players it usually came down to just two of the players staying in the round, usually one with a high card and one with a low card, so the winner was just whoever got luckier with their card draw and the kobayakawa card. With more players I imagine the bluffing and competition would be increased.

Grab a No Thanks deck, or any card game that has cards from 1-15 (Rage, Sticheln, Clubs, etc.), plus a few tokens, and give this one a shot. No need to buy the boxed version.

Update: Played a four player game using a Rage deck and it still just wasn't very fun. It seems way more random and doesn't have the magic of something like a Love Letter.

I hope to never play this again.  Betting on randomness with no control just isn't my cup of tea.  Maybe I just had horribly bad luck in my first game - losing with the best card to the second best card, losing with the third best card to the second best card, losing with the worst card in a tie with the dealer, etc.  It's hard to imagine a filler wearing out it's welcome, but then again, it's hard to imagine being eliminated from a filler early enough to want to look for something else to play while the rest of the group finished up.

Only 15 cards numbered 1-15.. thats it! So simple and yet so much fun! This is super easy to learn and the rounds go very quickly. Love how you really need to figure out how the other players are thinking and then pick the right action. And even though it looks like you might be way behind with the score it all can take a turn and you might win it all in a round. I really recommend the original Japanese version from Oink, the box and design is so much better than iellos version and it has beautiful metal coins!

A surprisingly analytic card game. Quick, with only two decisions to make per hand (switching cards, anteing). Fun to assess the deck, as well as the actions of your opponents.
Never count yourself out if you're losing early on. The last round is a game-changer.
Have only played with three people, but have a feeling that five or six players may increase the luck required to win by too much.
My favorite oink game so far.

Kobayakawa is a game I'd never heard of before.  I had no idea what to expect.

The six player game is played with 15 cards numbered 1 - 15 and plays over 7 rounds.  Everyone is dealt a card for the first round and starts with some money.  An initial card is revealed as the public card.

On your turn, you either draw a card and discard a card or replace the revealed card.  Then you decide if you'll ante or not for the round (1 coin every round except 2 on the last round).  Everyone reveals their cards.  The player with the highest total wins... with a twist (which makes the game) that the lowest card value also gets to add the value of the communal card.  Winner takes the pot.  Whoever has the most coins at the end of the game wins.

The game is a quick filler.  It's not the most complex game, but it makes for some interesting choices.  It's a little random, but for the length that's fine.

I think after this attempt, I am done with my infatuation of Japanese-designed minimalist fillers. Love Letter's emergence inspired me to hunt for these small fillers and nothing has quite impressed me since. Love Letter had just the perfect amount of guesswork, luck and length of play. Anymore or less and I would not have liked it. I cannot say the same for Kobayakawa. On paper, this game has potential but after a few plays, it boggles my mind how one could plan and do well in this game. So much luck rides on drawing the right card and not being messed up when a new card replaces the Kobayakawa deck. I mean after round 3, I pretty much gave up. Plus, catching up with the leader is tough and there is player elimination. All negative attributes.

My first play was marred by a pretty poor rules explanation... but once we got the hang of it and ironed out all the confusion it was a decent filler game.  But I felt it went too long playing for all the coins in the pot... unless we had too many in there which is entirely possible.  If you love bidding on relatively little information and like getting excited or groaning at most card flips you will likely enjoy this one... it just didn't have quite enough to think about for the time investment for me.

The game to teach newbies who might need to be eased into the hobby. Feels like gambling because it is just luck.

Fun filler, awesome for about five rounds then it gets shelved for a few weeks but it will resurface often

So simple, but clever little filler

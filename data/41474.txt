Game play is too long and English rules are very ambiguous.  The only plus is that it does a good job of simulating a bike race.

Oddly enough, I find the peloton too strong, but I'm a n00b at this one at this point, as are the rest of those I'm gaming with. The problem lies in the fact that we're running out of energy 4/5 into the race and the peloton catches up.

More avid fans with a greater degree of experience have to tweak the peloton in order to speed it up. I'm still trying to get to that point.

Still, it's a fun game... I used to ride, and I find it an interesting "sim" in a way.

RATING: 8.5
Good cycling simulation that recreates the excitement of cycling very nicely. There is drafting, making moves, giving chase, he leader wants others to take the lead, ways to block people from drafting, etc. Looks like the best cycling game out there. Management of energy and when to break out of the pelaton. Can be a bit punishing on the risks and there is a little randomness for puncture and if you take certain risks. My one complaint is probably it is a little long for what it is. I may make a modification or two to speed up game play. Also cool is that you can recreate the 2009 Giro! Many recommend this over Leader 1 which it reimplements.

Heavily thematic but thematically unappealing, Giro d’Italia presents the same range of challenges and strategies as the real cycling does, provided that you play it with the Leader 2 free expansion: nonetheless the game doesn’t shine at all, as there’s too much booking to take track of, which leads downtimes to stretch way too long than the acceptable.

Thus I would rate Giro d’Italia much lower than I did, as playing it feels closer to solving a mathematical problem than actually playing a game: yet, as with K2, its theme - despite far from being my favorite - is so accurately developed rules-wise that it saves the game overall by itself.

The themed version of leader 1 - with a few extra bits added on. This goes down well with our group, so it'll get to the table soon.

Same game as Leader 1 - see my comments there.  Giro comes with a few extras in the shape of some cards with specific abilities associated with cyclists and layouts for this year's Giro - nice extras, so worth getting this edition of the game (if you can withstand the overwhelming pinkness of the box).

RATING: 5
Beautiful game. LOTS of double sided hexes mean for virtually unlimited number of courses. No need to buy tracks (a la Formula De). Punctures are probably so random and rare that if it happens to you it will feel very unfair and a potential race killer. But this is less of an issue when each player has the full compliment of all three types of cyclists (all-around, uphill specialist, and downhill specialist). I've actually only played with 7 players so far, which is kinda lame. The game is clearly meant to be played with each player getting 3 bikes, which means no more than 4 players. Looking forward to trying the advanced mode of the complete race with time trials, multiple legs, etc. Expect rating to go up.

Players control a team of cyclists riding over a road race stage.  The game is played over a series of rounds where the order of play is "front to back", with a peloton marker representing the main field of riders.  Players off the front of the peloton get to move, the players get a chance to try and break off the peloton, then the player "controlling" the peloton sets the tempo, then the poor cyclists off the back pant along.  The designers are obviously fans of the great European "tours", as it's all here - falls, feeding, energy management, cyclist specialization, team tactics and collaberation, punctures, general classification over many stages.  Beautiful template hexes mean you can build any course you like featuring flats, rolling ground, mountains and descents.  Tiny, fragile cyclist miniatures get placed on the board when you break away or drop off the back, but then you begin using your own energy reserves rather than getting a tow in the peloton.  Only played a couple of games but very impressed with how the "feel" of cycling is preserved.  This is exactly the same game as Leader 1, with a deck of 15 "ability" cards and a complete layout for the 2009 Giro d'Italia included.  Excellent package.

I wanted to like this game so bad.  It looks good on paper and I can see why cycling fans would like it especially with the leader 2 rules, but I just found it to be sort of boring.  It's one of those games where you jockey for position the whole game and sprint to the finish and somebody wins by a nose.  I just don't feel like what I'm doing for most of the game really matters.  You just try to be efficient, and it's mostly obvious.  Then at the end it's very exciting about who managed to save that extra energy or two and the jockeying for position coming into the last few sections, but just doesn't seem like all that effort is worth the reward.

Formula Dé without the dice? So where's the game?

Riders have an amount of energy that they need to spend wisely during the race. Staying in the peloton is cheap in terms of energy spent but comparatively slow. The most important decision of the game therefore is when to break away. Breaking away costs (a lot) more energy, and if you try it too early you'll run out of steam and other riders (or even the peloton) will catch up. If you try it too late other riders will have had a head start that you won't be able to compensate.

Once you've broken out of the peloton the game is about small positional advantages, drafting, conserving your energy, and doing all of this just a tad better than your peers.

I played this on a cycling game night followed by "Um Reifenbreite" and it lost the comparison. While it is the better game from a gamer's perspective encompassing meaningful decisions and almost no luck, it just wasn't fun for me. Just recommended for players who enjoy developing the best algorithm to determine the time to break out from the peloton and distributing the action points over time with iterative loops for tactical optimization. Give me the dice to play Um Reifenbreite instead which means a lot if you know my taste.

The theme of Leader 1 did not attract me at all, but I was pleasantly surprised when I played that game at Essen and I bought it.

Later, I got the chance to trade Leader 1 for Giro d'Italia and took it, because it contains some extra options and the rules are a lot better written than those of Leader 1.

Ambientazione perfetta. Le tessere del percorso sono ben fatte, mentre gli altri materiali sono essenziali (a volte anche poco funzionali) ad eccezione dei fantastici modellini di ciclisti, un po' delicati, ma rappresentano la vera chicca del gioco. Si tratta di uno dei migliori giochi di simulazione sportiva e in particolare di corse che ho provato. Ricrea le grandi classiche del ciclismo; non mi convince invede l'idea della corsa a tappe (i distacchi non sono ben pensati) così come mi risulta astrattissima la cronometro. Un titolo immancabile per gli amanti del ciclismo, può risultare noioso invece per chi non è appassionato. Identico a Leader 1.

Have Leader1.  This is the same game with a few different hexes, some extra ability cards, and some minor rules changes.

Think can reconstruct from files here on BGG to create my own cards.  I dislike when companies release revised editions for less money with more in them so close to the original release.  Actually, I only dislike it when I've already purchased the original version.  :)

4/27/12: Provisional rating after 2 (solo) plays. I'm looking forward to trying more of the 20+ Giro stages. Sold March, 2014: $21

Sept. 2014: I love the Tour De France. I may not watch it as much in the future unless a real contender with personality arrives on the scene, I don't know.

This game was one I really wanted to love. I did love the components - the modular board, the cyclists. The box, the art.

The rules to the game were not quite right. I tried the mods that were available here on the 'geek, and that helped. But while the new rules made it a better simulation, I don't think they made a better game.

I really wanted to love this game.

Oct 2014: now a 4. Upon reflection, the rules are a mess, and I don't really want to bother with this one again. The pieces are cool though.

Belátom, feleslegesen vettem meg, mert a [thing=83040]Leader 1: Hell of the North[/thing] bőven elég a készletembe. A Giro nem is került sajnos az asztalra. Szép játék, amihez anno olcsón sikerült hozzájutnom, de a hullámpapír doboz és néhány játékelem minősége (pl. a kártyák) mind elmaradnak attól, amit az ember egy modern játéknál megszokott.

Viszont a hatszög lapkák kiváló minőségűek, csakúgy, mint a kerékpáros figurák. Sokat adnak a hangulathoz.

Nice idea and parts executed well + lovely bits. However are some flaws... plays too long for what it is and has a bit of "number-itis" (as many games like this will).

Thought it didn't recreate key aspects of actual racing but was a good enough game. (this isn't sour grapes as won with a moderately long breakaway).

Havent played the variant rules yet and thiese may address some of the porblems. Still would worry about game length for the weight the game is though. Try it...

Bought this for the extra tiles to add to HotN. The game itself looks to have some interesting ideas of it's own, and the different riders look good. However, I'll stick to Leader 1:Hell of the North now so won't bother playing or rating this. I'm sure it's  very good though - I love the Leader 1 system.

RATING: 9.9
Upgrading my ranking after finally getting a stage race in and finding a nice balance between Leader 2 and The Peloton variants. (The Peloton provides peloton movement rules and a nice visual for riders in the peloton. Leader 2 handles the rest.) 

This is easily the best game in my collection. I'm a big cycling dork, and this game simulates a bike race so well, it is as though I'm in the team car giving directions to my riders with commentary from Phil and Paul playing in the background.

Physically, the game board is gorgeous. And I appreciate that it's possible to build a long stage and still have my dinner table available for eating. 

The game tiles are the true genius of the game; that they're all different and provide the opportunity to dramatically change race tactics as riders pass through them. 

It's a simple game to learn and rules are intuitive. Even with my analysis-paralysis, games move along quickly while the pressure steadily builds: When will the attacks come? Should I have a rider in this breakaway? Does my rider have the juice to hold off the pack? etc., etc., etc...

That this game can support these kinds of real race-day questions while being simple to play is a testament to brilliant design. It is true game-making magic. 

So why not a perfect 10 for me? Compared to the genius of the board tiles, the craftsmanship that went into the rider miniatures is sorely lacking. And I wish the rouleur sculpt was more aggressive. I will eventually replace all of these.

There is also a slight, though notable, level of administrative upkeep needed while playing. Although not difficult, it can distract from the game and the step is easily forgotten. Accurate record-keeping is critical, however -- especially for stage races. I find myself double-checking the math and number of turns often.   

Still, those are just a couple areas of passable mediocrity in a box full of excellence. While Giro d'Italia and Leader 1 are essentially the same game, I'm leaning toward picking up Leader 1 to have more course options. I will definitely be picking up the anticipated Hell of the North expansion.

Hard to say how authentically it matches up with true Giro d'Italia bicycle racing, but so far it seems very realistic.  The hexagon map pieces make for a great amount of replayability, and the sample maps representing actual courses in the Italian race really add to its realism.  I'm a big promoter of this game and really like it! Played at Oasis of Fun in June 2011 then again at Unity Games XVIII, which was my best game yet! I've gotten pretty good at teaching this game with a quick start.

Very good, but difficult to get to the table unless you know a bunch of cycling nerds.  The dynamic of when and where to make a break from the peloton, combined with a team aspect, make this a real treat for people who avidly follow competitive cycling.  It works well as a large group game, with up to 10 players taking their own racer.  Not the best racing game out there, but quite good.

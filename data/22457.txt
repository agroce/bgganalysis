A simple game on the bulge that is playable in 2 hours. Minis are good. System in resolving battles are 'OK'.

Can't be used to have a good simulation or understanding of the actual battle, as it is so dependent on the die rolls.

Some gamers felt that the Germans have a higher chance of winning, but it really depends on the players as well as the die rolls.

Its a game, not a simulation at all.

This game shows what can happen when the developer and the designer are working at cross-purposes.

The addition of supplies to Axis and Allies is a great idea (and looong, [b]looooong[/b] overdue), and mechanically, it works great. However, the way it was implemented pretty much makes supply availability a non-issue. What could have been the best A&A game out there is just about average because of poor development choices.

Quicker than some of the other A&A games. Also accommodates fewer players. I like the territory divides and the reinforcement during gameplay - it adds a bit of accuracy to the game. Definitely a good buy if you enjoy the classic A&A.

[u]Pros[/u]:
* Large hexes
* Road Network
* Command and Supply
* Frontline thingies
* Interactive combat system, but unfortunately not for movement.
* Combat system is a nice experiment

[u]Cons[/u]:
* Plastics instead of counters. Historical identification and differentiated unit data could then have been displayed.
* Battle is a front line instead of the bulge-shape. So no Pattons counterattack from Luxemburg in northern direction.
* Too much supply
* Unlimited roadmovement is allowed. Traffic jams was common in the Battle. I won one game as the German by driving through an hole in the line, taking 24 points at once. So ... keep your line closed!
* No encirclement of Bastogne happens.
* Too few units in a hex leads to an almost certain destruction.
* Too many units in a hex leads to an almost certain hold. Some units have to retreat, but they can return the next turn.
* Why not everything interactive. 8 turns is very limited in achieving goals.
* Since the Allies may move last, he decides where battles take place and where to avoid them.
* Victory conditions are too flat. If the Germans can't get 24 points, there is not much left for him to play for, once the Allies are pushing him back.
* I believe the game favours the Allies.

In short ... a missed opportunity for a decent Bulge game.

Big, bold and brassy. I like this game, my kids think I'm kinda cool for having it so I don't really care if it's less than perfect in terms of the mechanics or balance. As for a lack of historical accuracy - I didn't buy it to serve as a modern history lesson.

RATING: N/A
Interesting design philosophy: a simple playable system, but a clear-eyed assessment of victory conditions based, not on German strategic goals, but on the realistic conclusion that Antwerp was unreachable.  Therefore the German player must "do better" than his historical counterparts.  This makes for a balanced game, but for me it does take a bit of the vicarious "drama" out of the situation.  German tanks remind me of the ones on the German campaign table in the movie, only smaller.

RATING: 7
Forget the A&A branding, this is really a solid, light-weight board wargame covering the Battle of the Bulge. Playable in 2-3 hours, this game hits all the highlights of the famous battle: the precarious supply situation for both the Allied and (particularly) German armies; the need to utlilize the road-net as effectively as possible; the telling effect of air-power when the weather finally clears; and the need for the Germans to the keep the Allies reeling before they can form a defensive line. The combat system is also a clean break from the original. It doesn't feel particularly "wargamey, (no terrain, air-power, or combined-arms modifiers or singe-die throw resolutions, for example,) but still stresses the importance of composing combined-arms forces and attacking targets along multiple routes. The best A&A game since A&A:Pacific.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very specific wargames compared to other wargames. You have to think to spare your supply either for movement or attack, very superior for Axis in the beginning of the game so you have to move immediately to gain victory before turn five whereas Allies will have air power superiority.
As for allies, it sucks to hold on in the beginning at the game, but believe me your job is just to defense as long as possible

RATING: 9
Though I enjoy A&A: D-Day more than this addition, I really like this game. Another one I play solitaire quite often. I really like the addition of "trucking the troops in". Moving the front line markers can get a little tedious by games-end, but it's still cool to watch the front line move. Great packaging and game components.

RATING: 6.1
Like ZOCs, 12-sided dice, combat mechanism (slide outs); dislikes: axis is always attacking/ allies only do damage control, bland terrain yet hard to distinguish the few "impassable" river hexsides, artificial game ending air power/supply situation that makes the 24 point German victory goal come down to a few roles... better than A and A D-Day.

An interesting and engaging A&A variant. I find it especially interesting to note that the German win condition is just to do better than the historical Germans did, and not to achieve an actual break-through.

Not bad, but leaves me wanting more: like terrain modifers, unit differentiation, more historical gameplay (the Germans just advance across the entire front).  Still, a good game to bring new players to the wargaming hobby.

edit: lowering score.  Unbalanced in German favor.  Even if the Americans can slow them enough to win, its no fun for them.  They simply get pummeled the entire time.  Other Bulge games allow for a satisfying counter attack or at least a great position or move to slow the Germans down.  Not so much here.

RATING: 6
(2009-02-21) Adam and I played a couple of turns this morning (we had to quit for lunch because we were using the kitchen table -- but my game room was to cold so we set it up there). Adam was the Germans, with a lot of help from Dad.

Yep, definitely a game, not a simulation, though it does have enough to impart something of a theme of what happened with the Germans short on reinforcements, aircraft, trucks and supplies, and the Allies at first desperately trying to block the German advance. I will admit the way supplies are handled is actually satisfying, and possibly the best part of the game. But the "attacker only scores hits" mechanic would drive me to distraction in a serious game with another wargamer, and I immediately see why some complain that a "bulge" probably won't ever happen. I'm not sure if he liked it or not yet -- but the plastic tanks, infantry and artillery and planes are definitely an attraction for him. We'll see if he asks to play again.

Good light war game. Has nothing to do with other games in the A&A series except the theme (second WW), name and unit pieces.

Unlike most light war games BoB has (simple) rules on zone of control and supply that allow some interesting strategies. Another plus is the appearance of the board, which I find visually appealing ("less is more"). As a downside, the game has only one scenario that favors Germany. The d12 combat system seems to produce a bit too random results, i.e. the results are much less predictable than in most other wargames I know e.g. other games in the A&A series.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The supply system in this is brilliant. I spend about half of my planning time deciding where I'm going to put supply depots and how many units of supply to assign to each one, and that process is a lot of fun. The combat system takes a little getting used to. You can screen your more important units but you have to think about it for a minute. The wrong mix of units will not help keep your armor/artillery safe.

Plays quite different than other A&A games; in my opinion out of balance in favor of the Axis player; therefore less fun to play the Allies; actually the Allies can't do more than trying to stop the Axis as much as possible with a big chance they won't succeed in it; nevertheless playing occasionally is fun; perhaps with addition of some house rules more balance can be achieved.

6/1/2009: First play - what a great little wargame! Tension throughout, with the historical ebb and flow as dictated by the second half arrival of Allied airpower beautifully implemented.

Players play the Western Allies or Germans during the Battle of the Bulge.  One of the most gamed subjects returns again ... the Wallies get their line breached, Germans stream through, run out of puff and it's contained a month later.  This game recreates the situation quite well, the initial US line melts away, the Germans run amok for 4 turns before the advance peters out.  The sequence of play is the sides gets to alternate activating one hex to attack, until both sides decide to pass.  This is followed by a movement phase of 1 hex (or unlimited for trucks/tanks along roads).  Lastly, the front line is reset and victory points for territory taken is adjusted.  Germans win if they can take 24 points worth of towns, Wallies win if they can last eight turns.  A very quick, but rather simple wargame, right down at the introductory level.  It all works nicely, but there's not much meat there.

RATING: 9
 Zone of control and supply issues are both handled well.  Defintely a departure from all other A&A games, but a welcome one. This feels like a combination of a serious war game with the A&A series, but yet it is very approachable and easy to teach. Good work Larry!

Ok, the good points - it's short, pacing is good and the game is reasonably exciting. 

Like most Bulge games, the Germans are in the driver's seat and there are some finer decision-making moments in the game where the Germans have to decide on the management of the supply points and marshaling it to their main thrusts. 

But, and here comes the bad points - the US doesn't seem that interesting to play, and worse of all, don't seem to be able to make any reasonable defence against the Germans. Even bad plays by the Germans can see them through (trust me, I know all about making bad plays as Germans). St. Vith falls with ease. And Bastogne can be taken as long as the Germans concentrate their effort there. 

The only way the US can win is if horrible luck strike the Germans, and this is not an impossible thing given the combat system. 50% hit probabilities on a d12 with a hit allocation spread system - let's just say a lot of crazy things can happen.

A Axis and Allies remake of a classic Bulge game...so not much of a bulge really happens.  Instead, the German front pushes in and the Allies eventually stop them.  When and where determines victory.  Not bad...just not as good as FAB: The Bulge or many other newer Bulge games.

Game is somewhat long (3-4 hours).  The combat system is refreshing, but requires a lot of die rolling.  I'm not a big fan of using D12's, but can understand the need to do so to make the hit allocation system work.

Unfortunately I found the game ends as soon as the allied air units (3:1) come into play, as they just pulverize everything in sight, and there is little which can be done to stop them.

Will be re-reading the rules and trying this one again to see if we missed anything.

Extremely fun and moderately light wargame. I love the supply rules and the hit allocation. Great fun even for non-grognards.

It's a little fiddly with the bits and the quantity of bits is bizarre (eg not enough US or UK infantry but FAR too many German artillery).

I prefer to play as the Allies just to see if I can stem the tide of Axis advance and it is great fun getting pounded on... but then maybe that says a lot about me as a person? ;)

I don't understand why so many Bulge games have been produced over the years, the Germans didn't have a hope of winning the real battle, so we're in history lesson rather than game territory here. This one is living proof, though that a wargame doesn't have to be complex to be realistic. It's surprisingly thinky for a die rolling game with consideration of supply availability that puts many more serious games to shame (I'm thinking of SPI's output here). Trouble is, I just can't see the German player winning, short of blitzing through the early gaps in the Allied line and gambling on getting the initiative roll next turn. Failing that, some judicious early retreating by the Allies should comfortably see them home.

Feels much more like a traditional wargame than previous Axis & Allies efforts. You now have to deal with zones of control and supplies. The zones are large hexes rather than the normal Axis & Allies random shaped areas. The combat system has been upgraded too, casualties are removed at a more realistic rate and some combat results cause retreats rather than annihilation. The game is still fun and light in the A&A tradition but with a more realistic feel to it.

Good hex-based wargame, all about managing a fighting retreat without getting cut off (for Allies) Or managing an advance with overwhelming force but limited supplies (Axis).

When that cloud cover lifts the Axis trucks need to run for cover!

OK, so I've played this twice now, and it is a fun 2-3 hour battle. Picture a small hex-and-counter game, with fairly low counter density, but blown up into an over-produced board game. If you like bits it's very very cool. And it definitely has that old school Axis & Allies feel. Here's my one reservation: I'm not sure it is a very deep game. Seems that die-rolling should win the day and that there aren't too many opportunities to fine tune strategies. But take that for what it's worth given that I've only played twice. And moving tanks and rolling dice is always fun.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is a very different game than the original.  There's a tactical theater focus, and it's all about logistics.  

As the great General Omar Bradley said, "Amateurs study strategy, professionals study logistics." Battle of the Bulge is a test of  logistics.  Can the Germans keep their drive supplied?  Can the Allies conduct an orderly retreat while covering their supply lines?  

Game play is about 2 hours, and with evenly matched players, it will come down to the very end.

Nice easy game if you want to get though the Bulge quickly. Like the supplies, not as crazy about the map (bit bland), but is challenging. Is a bloody game and units in heavy combat will not survive for long. Really tricky to try to get as far with the German penetration as they did historically. You have to move the units just so....

Think I'll crack this out this December though!  My son and I have asked for one of the 1940 games each for Xmas, and after then well be busy with the global stuff!

RATING: 6
Decent overall but frustrating.

Half the game is built around the supply system, which is fundamentally excellent, but they go and give both players so much supply that you wonder why they bothered at all. The German player, who historically had limited supply, will only run out if they make a big mistake or get very unlucky and the Allied player will be swimming in so much supply that they won't even bother bringing most of it on to the board. 

It feels like the game could be improved by halving the amount of supply each side gets every turn or by just removing all the supply tokens and trucks and ignoring the supply rules.

Also the air combat system is tedious to the extreme.

Major German victory.  Would like to play again as the Allied player to try a different strategy than my opponent tried on the defense.  Seems as if the Allies need to leave token infantry units behind to stop German Armor advances, and create a defensive line around the middle of the board to stop the German advance and start a counter attack.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoy the level of complexity in this game. It hits the sweet spot for me in terms of offering some nice thematic touches to enhance the experience of recreating history while avoiding tons of exceptions and special cases.  My biggest problem with the game is the initiative roles for combat as they seem overpowerful and a bad run on those particular rolls will sink your chances of winning (of course rolling poorly in any A&A game is not going to be good but the entire game seems to me to rest on only 7 combat initiative rolls (no role for round 1). My first play saw the battle come down to a struggle for Bastogne and exhibited a bulged front line that rather nicely approximated the historical front.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Where AA:BotB fails for me is the way it portrays the scenario: Whereas the bulge campaign is a very interesting subject, the game manages to reduce it to a board-optimisation exercise that feels largely scripted, or at least reasonably simple to optimise to the first approximation. 

There don't really seem to be any real choices to be made as the allied commander, and the Germans really don't seem to have all that many options either as to where and how to attack, so the interesting notion of both sides being under pressure (for the Germans to reach to the offensive's goals before allied airpower can be brought into effect - for the allies to play the forward defence, avoiding encirclements and terrain loss, while keeping a continuous line of Zones-of-Control) is reduced from what it might have been, if there had been any room for tactical manoeuvring, to stacking up on a couple of enemy hexes each turn.

The fixed turn order doesn't help any, either. The allies are denied any chance of surprising or even offensive operations, since they are always reacting to the german attacks.

In its favour, AA:BoB does have some new wrinkles on the system, especially the use of supplies to fuel operations, which really cry out for better possibilities for tactical manoeuvering.

Bottom line is: I was never a huge fan of Axis and Allies (though Pacific and 1942 are a lot more interesting than the rest), but to me this game seems mostly a dud. I wouldn't say broken, because I guess the designs intent has been reached. It's just not the design I would have done.

AA:BotB is Beer & Pretzels, which really is fine, it's just not for me.

I like what they're doing with A&A, and I was eager to see the famous Bulge get the treatment here. Unfortunately I wasn't entirely happy with what came of that. I think it feels too close to an old wargame, with zones of control and a length that overstays its welcome. (I'm not against hexes and ZOCs, but I thought this line was trying to show more streamlining and innovations.)

Fairly short set up time for a game of this style.

A fun battle, supply, and reinforcement distribution game. A nice mechanism for battling. I found it to be hard to win for the Germans. The rules need some clarifications on how you can move supply and reinforcements on the board. It seems just about immpossible to get all the supplies and reinforcements to the front line. A bit long for my taste.

Phil and me were totally dissapointed with this game. In fact when moving back to Europe, this one was one of the few "left behind"
The supply was never a limitation, due to sequence of play, reconquering terrain by the allied troops is virtually impossible, and we never felt like facing crucial decissions. What a pity! i was really looking for a light "Bulge" game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice change of pace for the series and a well done light wargame.  My only complaints are the lack of terrain benefits and defensive fire, and that the victory system is city based so the Germans have no real need to reach the Meuse.  Also, this one would have benefitted from a victory scale, as opposed to a simple win or lose.

Despite the nay sayers, this is a nice little game. Being an Axis and Allies game it wasn't going to have counters or be a sim, but it's playable and fun. The high points are the supply rules and the nifty combat mechanic; the front line markers are cute too. It probably lacks replayability, but each game is engaging and full of do-or-die decisions.

The battle-then-move structure is refreshing, and the passing initiative is fun and reminiscent of tactical level games. The movement & reinforce phase can bog down though. The game seems tough for the Allies to win, and there often aren't big strategic moves you can make until the Axis starts to break through or until the air support shows up. Still it is a nice semi-historically accurate representation and a great 2-player epic, with some really unique ideas in air support, casualty assignment, and supply lines. Shame it is so long.

Germans won with 25 points on game turn 3.  Trucks loaded with arty and infantry busted through the lines stopping at enemy controlled towns which they then occupied for the win.  The fall of Bastogne on game turn 2 opened it up for the Germans.  The truck rules are bad enough to create a lot of doubt early on as to how they move/are used.  Artillery is very powerful and bombers (never made it in the game played) are even more brutal.  Good game that can use some rule clarifications and some red front line markers instead of snow gray = hard to see.

Rules made it sound good at first...this game is better than D-day by alot but still has problems.  Fun but not fun enough, historical but not historical enough, simple but not smooth/intuitive enough.  

Supply rules are awkward, as are the stacks of supply units and commandeering rules.  Blitz rules will never get used in any meaningful way due to the supply rules and how the sequence of play works.  Thus the game feels only lightly tested.

The map focusses on the road net and has a few blocked river hexsides...and that's it.  A bulge game with no woods, unlimited road movement and a sizable German air presence for half the game.  Like D-Day the end game suffers from a dearth of units, as the game is overly attacker friendly (unless supply bounds you, you may as well always attack)...add in airpower and by turn 8 nobody is left.

A near miss for grognards.  For non-wargamers or light-wargamers, this game might get them enthused but I can't say for sure.

RATING: 8.5
A lot of fun to play. Still haven't decided whether or not it is perfectly balanced. If the Allied player can hold out until turn 5, he can use his air superiority to hammer the Axis supplies and hopefully bring the German war machine to a grinding halt.

Finally got this one to my table last week and was very excited(I originally got this as a gift years ago and never tabled it, boy am I regretting not playing this game earlier. For being an Axis and Allies game, this version has the least familiarity to the traditional A&A games. I like to think of this one as A&A all grown up, has hexes, zones of control, supply, weather, but still the familiar A&A pieces. Different dice(12sided) and combat system(all hits count but are now random, no more defender eating up all his hits in infantry while his tanks and fighters go untouched). I really enjoyed this game! I enjoyed the moving front rules(although actually moving the front pieces from time to time was a little frustrating if there is a bunch of other pieces around) and trucks and supply, as well as terrain movement rules. A lot of more "traditional" war games style rules can be found in this version. It is a great version for the A&A player to use to cross over to the more traditional war games.
I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a bridge between traditional A&A and more conventional war games.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] The zone of control and supply rules are interesting innovations over the traditional A&A game, and they apply well here. The innovations of the combat system are too clever by half, and in my opinion could have been better handled more traditionally. The 12 sided dice and the hit allocation system are a touch too fiddly, but overall not intolerable.

More than most A&A games, the luck of gaining initiative repeatedly or at crucial moments can be very unforgiving. The Allied player must occasionally create larger stacks in some hexes along the front if he hopes to ever stop the onslaught - and if he loses the initiative roll on that turn he can only sigh and watch the massacre. 

I wish there was more opportunities for clever play and decision making, but as in A&A D-Day, there is no decision involved as to when units arrive and where, that is all scripted. Traditional A&A games allow the player to make more strategic decisions which I enjoy, whereas this is entirely tactical without too much latitude at that level. Since I seem to be piling on with complaints, I wish the board was a bit more interesting and less drab.

Overall I don't this is a bad game, I will happily play it occasionally, but it lacks a spark of something special for me. If I wasn't very interested in this period and this battle, there would be very little to recommend here compared to some of our favorite wargames. I do think, however, that it is a good introductory game for kids and new wargamers, and like I said - the occasional romp to remind oneself of the Battle of the Bulge.

German tanks thunder into the snow-covered Ardennes forest, opposed only by a few unsuspecting divisions of exhausted American troops. As Axis forces plunge into the countryside, Allied troops must struggle to hold the front line in order to repel the all-out offensive. Axis & Allies: Battle of the Bulge challenges you to control territory and contend with supply shortages, while directing infantry, artillery, tanks, and aircraft in one of the most decisive conflicts of World War II.

Scheduled for release in November, 2006, Axis & Allies Battle of the Bulge will feature detailed game components including a new truck piece, a hex-based game board with new original artwork, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the Battle of the Bulge game box. Other elements of this new Axis & Allies variant include crucial elements that were key factors in the historical battle, such as supply shortages and late-battle air support, mechanics for overland vs. road movement and randomized casualties of war

Axis & Allies depicts Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhein), the German code name for this counteroffensive that took place toward the end of World War II. The objective: to capture the port city of Antwerp. It was expected that the capture of Antwerp would cause a great disruption in the flow of Allied supplies, and also have the effect of breaking apart the great Anglo-American alliance.

One player controls Germany, whose massive build up of forces have gone undetected by the Allies and are poised to unleash all their fury on the Allies. The other player controls the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States and they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.

Takes Axis and Allies in a whole new direction.  Just the fact that this game doesn't sweep logistics under the rug makes it worthwhile.  I would like it if the overall amount of supplies were a bit tighter, and may houserule that in the future, but just having to plan where you want to place your supply dumps, and, for the Germans, how many of your trucks you're willing to use to accomplish that, leads to some unique and welcome decision-making.

Not just another Axis and Allies, this one goes to great lengths to differentiate itself from the rest of the series, and succeeds startlingly well.  It keeps the fast-paced feel of the rest of the series, but adds tactical and positional decisions that really make it a whole different game.  After my first play, I was concerned about the replay value, but I now think there is enough inherent variability in the system (without being overly random) to keep it fresh.  The slow American retreat is well portrayed, and the combat strips are a remarkably intuitive way of distributing casualties.  There's no question that this is marketed more to the gamer than the rest of the series, but it's certainly appropriate for more than just dyed-in-the-wool grognards.  This one seems to have flown under the radar, but if you see a copy, I would suggest giving this game a try.  I have suspicions that the game favors the Germans, but until I play this a few more times, they're just suspicions.

 I've only played a few games...so the jury is out.  Looks like a great addition to the series.

Battle of the Bulge is very different from the rest of the Axis and Allies family. This title focuses on a single battle rather than the entire theater of war usually covered by the global A&A games. It uses a completely new combat mechanism, as well as introducing concepts new to Axis and Allies such as battlefronts and supply lines. I like what the new additions bring to the game and the tactical depth provided by the need to push the front back and forth. It's a bit more high maintenance than your typical A&A game, but it's a solid design that's worth the effort to learn it.

Never could get into this campaign.  The results were foregone, so it's already "gamey" (which is not a problem for the game itself, but does reduce my interest in the theme, as so little was really at stake).

Anyone who's seen my other rating on anything Axis & Allies related will know I tend to rate anything Axis & Allies on the high side.  With that said, this one's really a break from the traditional AA board and combat style.  It's more of a bridge to the wargame side with "Zones of Control" and supply rules.  It has the same quality as all the other games in the series including plenty of fun in the way the battle can play out.  It's much more simplified than a hex & chit game on the Bulge but many of the critical points like supply, river crossing problems, delayed airpower, blitzing armor, and artillery are all there along with the all too familiar platic AA minis.  I wanted an AA Bulge game when AA:D-Day came out.  I now have my wish and am not disappointed.

After more play I'm upping my rating by a few tenths.  Though this game may be too simple for grognards, it's a must have game to introduce someone to wargames.  It's a perfect starting level wargame that is one step up from my "beer & pretzel" category.

I am not a Fan of A&A but I can recommend this title as a decent Bulge title for the uninitiated to wargaming, and a good play even for the experienced wargamer. Oddly enough, I expected this to be way too light to enjoy, but the game does a good job of making the player really make both strategic and tactical decisions. The dicing for hits issue is not as bad as in regular A&A, instead there is a distinct possibility you can force retreats. Air is dramatically effective, as it should be, once it comes into play. And the entire supply mechanism captures more feel to the battle than one might imagine. The game uses a truck transport rule that is easy to slip up on the first play of the game by the way, remember that trucks get left out on the board until the beginning of the next turn's movement phase. This makes them vulnerable to air attacks in ways that can cripple the German player late in the game. The press to take as much ground as possible by the germans will be offset by the need to keep concentrations for attacks. Definitely recommended, just remember it's a light title for the subject matter, missing realistic simulation value in terms of historic detail and accuracy. But Big Whoop. It's still fun.

I think it's the most interesting of all the A&A boardgames (and with an original damage system), but it's still not a game I would play on a regular basis.

Have yet to play this one. I have other war games that will always come before this one I fear. I like the look of it though. Hopefully one day we will just crank out  game.

In my humble opinion the best of the Axis & Allies games. The way supply and movement is handled is simple yet perfect for the battle. I cannot recommend this game enough.

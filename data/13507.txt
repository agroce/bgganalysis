A simple yet fun matching card game in which players must try to wink at their partner that turn without being caught. In the right group of people this is a funny game. The Target version plays 10 people instead of 8.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a good party game, very simple to learn, and fun to play.  The game can be played in a relatively short amount of time also, which is a bonus.  Basically, the point of the game is to get the most cards for "points" by finding who has the matching card for one you pick on the table, and the only way the person that has the card can let you know they have it is by winking, but if they get caught by anyone, then the other person can steal both points.  We had lots of laughs, and it was actually a bit more challenging to catch the "winkers" than I thought it would be.  It's fairly cheap as well, so I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a little variety in their party game lineup.

Weirdly difficult for some people to grasp, Wink is nevertheless a fairly elegant package of rules and bits that's  fun and plays up to 8. With the right group I could see this being even more fun. It's original, colorful, and small; I don't see why I'd ever be in a hurry to get rid of it.

WINK is a game which works best with a crowd.  There's quite a bit of interaction with players in a very unique way which makes for an intriguing, albeit rather quiet, experience.  While it can be played with as few as three, I wouldn't recommend it with less than five, and six seems to be the sweet spot.  It's a pretty fun game that doesn't last too long and makes for a different and distinct experience.

Wonderful party game.  I wonder why this game seems to be so unknown, I suppose one could make a homemade version pretty easily.  It is a really good idea for a game, it is really hard to imagine how the game would play by simply reading the rules.  It seems like it would be way too easy to spot someone winking, but it's actually quite difficult to spot unless you luck out.  A minor quibble: the game only officially supports six players.  Playing with any less seems like a waste of time, and it would be nice to be able to play with 8 or 10.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/8xP1YRAMC2U

Wink is a clever party game. There are two identical sets of cards with numbers and faces on. The first set is laid on the table in a 6 by 6 grid and the other dealt out to players. On your turn you place a token of your colour on on of the cards in your grid that isn't in your hand, before your next turn the person who holds that card must wink at your, without being seen... if they do you both get a point. BUT if someone spots you they get two points. This has gone down super well with lots of groups, but works much better with 6-8 players rather than the claimed 4+. You probably need the right sort of crowd too.

This game is outrageous! This is a card game without tricks or strategy, just good ol fun! Whenever I've played the game, it's less about who wins and more about catching other people when they're signaling to their "partner." Fantastic game and lots of fun! Rules are simple and it plays quick.

Silly game that was, surprisingly, a lot more fun than expected after the rules explanation! It's silly fun.

You make a 6x6 display of uniquely numbered cards, and deal out 7(?) cards per player. On your turn, put your pawn on a card in the display that you do NOT have in your hand. If another player has that card, they will try to secretly wink at you. When it's your turn again you must pick one player who you think has the card (hopefully, you caught the wink!): if correct, you both score 1VP (they add their card to their score pile, you add the card from the display). If incorrect, just flip the card in the display over. Then, you pick your next card, and repeat above.

That in itself would probably be pretty fun. Even better, though, is that everyone starts with 4 Accusation cards. If you see someone wink at someone else, you may play the card and accuse the winker as having that card -- if correct, you score BOTH cards. Unplayed Accusation cards are worth 1VP themselves. That means that everyone is very intently looking at everyone else's eyes, and you have to be extra sneaky in order to wink when you want!

The game ends when the display is empty, or all cards are flipped face down. The player with the most VP wins!

Fun with four, likely even better with more!

Someone walking into a room while a game of Wink is in progress would find a group of intense, mostly silent players, all with smiles or smirks on their faces, scanning the other players' eyes, back and forth, back and forth until someone erupts in laughter or yells in accusation! I don't think I've ever laughed as hard playing a party game as we did when playing Wink.  

Essentially, each player has several numbered cards in his or her hand. There is a grid on the table with each of those numbers (plus extras). On his turn, a player puts his colored peg on a number on the grid. Whoever has that number now has to wink at that player before his next turn. On his next turn, he states who he thinks has that number (based on who winked at him). If correct, both players get a point. Sound easy? Not so! Each player has several accusation cards. If you catch someone winking, you throw it down and accuse the winker with the corresponding number. If the accuser is correct, she gets to steal the cards (cards represent points at the end of the game). Depending on the participants, it can be really hard getting a wink across before the turn gets to that player again.  

I found very quickly that players seem to naturally flow into one of several personas when playing Wink. There's the bold and brazen who actively try to create distractions so others won't notice them winking (I've seen fake sneezes, directed attention at something else in the room, faking that a child "needs help" with something, suddenly itchy faces, all sorts of attempts). There's the guy who is a little "too cool" to wink at someone else who get caught almost every time trying to be suave. There's the spy who focuses almost solely on catching other people winking (these ones are the most frustrating!). And then there's the solid player (who usually wins!) who finds a great balance between simultaneously searching for incoming winks and delivering a smooth, undetectable wink to her target. 

You'll find that introverted players have a hard time looking at others in the eye (it's kind of hilarious watching them in the beginning, especially if it's their first time playing, and they're trying to wink at my wife sitting right next to me!). As eye contact is an absolute requirement of Wink, they typically open up pretty quickly. The funniest moments are those where eye contact was made and both players maintain eye contact for longer than the acceptable norm would allow because they think, for some reason, that the other is going to wink at them. They stay locked for several seconds, flick their eyes away before coming back and laughing hysterically.  
Oh, and don't wear wide-brimmed glasses while playing Wink! Not having good peripheral vision is hard because you have to turn your head further to wink at the players next to you. It makes being sneaky more difficult. I learned this the hard way in our first game. 

Overall, Wink is a fantastic party game that is quick to learn, quick to play, and really breaks the ice if ice-breaking is desired. I give it a solid 8.5 as one of my top party games.

RATING: 6
[FX Schmid 94 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; partnership, action; optimal 6p} Zwinkern is an interesting and unique party game. It's unique because players have to look at each other during the game (Have you played "eye killer" before?). Essentially, a player collects cards by "winking" at his potential partner, while watching other players to spot whether they are secretly communicating to each other. It sounds easy and stupid but it is fun. It's more fun when more players are involved. However, the replayability is not very strong. It's only fun every a while.

The box is bigger than necessary. The artwork of cards is interesting. Zwinkern is funnier with more people. I usually play it with 8 players.

[Variant for 7/8 players 1] Use the original 36 cards and eye cards. Each player will have 2 'Big Eye' cards. 2 additional pawns are needed (I picked from Diamant).

[Variant for 7/8 players 2] Use 48 cards and original eye cards. Each player will have 2 'Big Eye' cards and 5 Person cards. 2 additional pawns are needed (I picked from Diamant). 2 decks of 48 cards are needed (I picked from 6 Nimmt and Relationship Tightrope.)

Played once with in-laws (who love quick, easy, party games), and we had a blast.
Initially rated 8 based upon this experience.

Our group is generally very paranoid and on-edge with each other (resistancewerewolfspyfall) ... so the level of tension made this game sooo much better.

Don't forget to wink at the people who marked the cards in your hand! All you need to do is mark a card you don't have. Mark cards you don't have and watch what other cards people mark. Mark a card you don't have, watch the other marks, and wait for someone to wink at you. Mark a card you don't have, watch the other marks, keep an eye out for someone winking at you, and try to catch other people winking @ each other. Mark cards you don't have, watch for other marks, keep an eye out for someone winking at you, look for others winking at others, and...and...Oh! I forgot to wink @ Sarah AGAIN!! AMAZING, FUN!!

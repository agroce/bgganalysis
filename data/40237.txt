There's certainly nothing like it in my collection, but this game isn't terribly interesting in play. As far as I can tell, there aren't any interesting decisions. There's alot of luck (as one might expect), but it feels constrained in what you can do on a given turn. The large deck of cards do not offer interesting surprises. Some of the horse powers do not correspond with the cost. And dang those stickers keep coming off the pieces! So over all, rather blah.

RATING: 7
A fun, gambling-type game of horse racing.  Buy horses, place bets on horses.  The game is terribly random (yay for dice), though the cards allow for a lot of push/pull.  Scales well to at least 5-6 (and probably all the way to 8, though there would be more downtime).

What really makes this one is that it's [i]fun[/i].  There's something about it -- sitting around the board, jockeying for position, rooting for this horse or that horse -- [i]"Come on number 6!"[/i]  It's just flat-out fun!  You'll see what I mean when there are 5+ horses in the No Bets area and it's any horse's game.

I rather enjoy this one.  It makes for nice medium-length filler.  Not too long, involving enough that players will stay awake during other players' turns.  Turns go quick, gameplay keeps moving.  No real strategy or tactics (at all), just lots of dicey, random fun.  Give it a shot!

9/10/13:  Rating lowered from 8 to 7 (because I finally noticed and got around to it).  I am not a fan of race games.  And this is a race game that, as with so many race games, is ruled by the dice roll.  And that annoys me.  Go ahead, try to be strategic.  Oh, TOO BAD!  The dice disagree.  You lose.  Still, this is an excellent race game and it's fun to shout for your horse(s).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I don't like the idea that a horse can move backwards during the race and there may be a play balance problem with some players being able to own more horses than other players. A race only takes less than hour so more than one race can be played during a gaming session to balance things out. The payoff odds need considerable adjustment. In a ten-horse field the long shot should have longer odds than 9:1.

As horse racing games go, this is actually pretty good.  The humor, like that in most games, has a shelf life - but beyond that - the basic play is enjoyable.  It has the advantage that it plays equally well across a large number of players and as such is good for Cons or crowd events.  It's also horse racing - so it stands up to hoots and hollers just fine.  A solid showing.

mmmm....what I'd call an after dinner game, where it would help to be plastered. It really is the epitome of random, roll 2 dice that determine which horse moves and how far, draw a card that may or may not give you cash or move a random horse (or something else random).

There is no real control its just a ride. Either you enjoy chaotic dice games or you don't and despite this being a short game, I was pretty sick of it as soon as it started.

Not a bad game by any means, but the decisions to make in this game were so...  straightforward:

Is that horse ahead?  Bet on it.
Can you make your horse a leader?  Do so.
Can you knock-back an opposing horse?  Do so.

It wasn't bad, but in the end, it leaves you with that feeling of eating sugarless oatmeal.  The luck you get one way or the other doesn't matter all that much, but yet it has little in the way of strategic elements.  In the end, it's a fun exercise, but I'm not sure it's much more.

Played 4 times with 4 players.  It is a lot of fun.  Deciding whether to influence the horses with your cards or buy horses or place additional bets is not a simple task.  It isn't rocket science, but it does require some thought and the game is loads of fun... it has a good balance of luck and skill, especially for a horse racing game.  It's worked well with 6 and 8 player games too.

Good game.  Gamers who are anti-racing game will be turned off, even though this is more about the speculation than the race.  Plays fast too, so if you make a wrong move in your strategy, it's easy to blame a bad dice or bad card draw rather than game play.  Fun, but not for everyone.

This game is a lot of fun.  It plays in a reasonable amount of time, and while luck is certainly a factor, there are plenty of decisions to make - buying horses, playing cards, placing bets.  Easy to learn and fun to play.  I could see this game being very popular with non-gamers.

RATING: 5.5
A fun horse racing (but mostly betting) game if you don't mind a lot of dice-rolling and luck-of-the-draw.  There is enough strategy to keep gamers interested, but it is light enough for the whole family.  Plus it can hold 8 players.

The game tends to stay close until the bitter end because collectively the group can pull back the leader(s).  This means that most players will have a chance to win even when things look pretty bleak.

Original comment: Pretty fun family game.  Seems like it will be quite different with 3-4 players versus 7-8 players (especially the number of horses that players own).

Siddy7's comment: Too long, too much luck of cards, and too little you can do. Too bad because I wanted to like it more.

Unlike other racing games - actual 'race' isn't the main are of interest (no fences, no blocking), it's all about which horses you back (and/or buy) and card play.

Hrmm, I had fun enough playing I guess, but there are other games in this genre that are so much better.  Long Shot is so completely random that any decisions you make really don't make any difference.  The rolls are random, the cards you get (of extremely varying powers) are random, the results of a bunch of the cards are random.  It also doesn't seem like the cards or horse powers were very well thought out.  Some of the horse special powers are completely useless, like the horse that can move up into a tie for last place if it ever finds itself in last place.  And many of the cards do the same thing, but with varying levels of power.  Once player can draw a card that gives him $20 for no reason, while another player might get a card that gives him $5, but only if he satisfies certain requirements.  What the heck? 

Despite the lack of any kind of balance or semblance of any kind of control, all in all, it still manages to be somewhat fun just because I enjoy betting/wagering type games, but it isn't a particularly strong entry in the genre.

Bought from Tanga.  Gave one as a gift to the Waites.  Have another copy to give away to a lucky friend as well.  Everything has been stickered and rules have been read.  Just need to find the right group of 6 or 8 people to play it.  (5/4/11)

Played with a group of Seven and this isn't too bad of a game. Nothing spectacular but the fact it plays tgat many people comfortably is good. Its hard to get asl the bets down that you want is fine, but kind of frustrating that there really isn't enough cash to 5ish out at the end so have to write everything down to figure out the cash.  This brings out down a little for me. Rather solid 7 for me.  (7/2/11)

Probably one of the best "large group" games I have played in a long time.  Six or Seven would be the ideal number of players, so that the horse ownership gets spread out evenly.

A great gambling game, lots of randomness with the dice for movement, and a strong scaling mechanism between the cost of the horse and the benefits the horse receives.  This was a lot of fun, and something I would play with larger groups on a regular basis.

I like this more than I should.  It really has a lot of luck to it, and a little bit of "take that."  On the other hand, I find it to be very, very fun.  Also, it scales well, though I don't think I'd play with 7 or 8 for downtime reasons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
On my first play of Long Shot, I mistakenly thought of it as a racing game. It's not. Long Shot is a family-friendly betting game, and it's a pretty good one.

On a player's turn, you roll dice, move one or more horses, and then optionally bet on a particular horse or play a card from your hand. Turns are fairly fast, the horse lead changes enough without being totally chaotic, and the game handles a wide range of player counts. The result is fun and a sort of cross between family game and gamer's party game.

6 plays (3p, 4p, 6p, 7p)--Fun game. (Look at the number of positive comments here that use the word "fun".) Some excitement, good gambling choices, not just about luck: The same person won all 3 games with 3-4p I played (the evil D). However luck seems to be stronger when playing with 7.  However 7 is a lot for burden any game, and so is 6, but I'd say it works reasonably well, just a little long. Still, one person in my 6-player crowd requests this emphatically. {Play this to get in the mood: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6djgavbp7c}

My go-to party game, which can work surprisingly well with two players.  To play with 2, deal one $20, $15 and $10 horse to a dummy player and have somebody roll for them.  They place no bets, but their horses can do surprisingly well enough to make a difference.

The game is filled with luck, but it's about horse racing, shouldn't it be filled with luck.  This is one of those games that gets people standing up, off of their seats, as they round the home stretch?  Great stuff and very under-rated.  Far more engaging that other standard gateway fare (i.e. ticket to ride and settlers).  There is palpable tension and excitement in the air as the horses come down the home stretch.

A simple stock market game disguised as a racing game. The special abilities and odds of the 10 horses are wildly imbalanced. Cards add a random element to an already random game (the 'move a horse three spaces back' card is just silly). I prefer Royal Turf (aka Winner's Circle) which is much more streamlined and better balanced and where you (at least) seem to be more in control of the outcome. I do like the fact that in Long Shot you can still buy shares, i.e. bet on horses,  during the race, although this doesn't make sense thematically. I guess I wouldn't turn down an occasional game if others requested it but I'm perfectly happy without ever playing LS again.

Fun light game that I bought for my wife--she loves horses. Plays quickly and it's fun to cheer for a particular horse. Much more fun with 4-6 players. With more than 6 players, you're not going to get to do as much, especially place bets. I'd still bring it out for that many though.

De. 30, 2010: I bumped this game up to an 8. It just gets played a lot! My wife always requests it.

It's all about the money with Long Shot.  Which is a good thing.  With a good horse you can try for prize money.  With a keen eye you can place bets.  The cards let you make money of fast or slow horses, and get some cash together until it's time to make your move.  Long Shot is a fun group game with good components and theme.  The money is nice, but I am looking forward to trying it with poker chips.  This one is definitely worth a play if you have a chance.

RATING: 8.25
Get this game, get this game, get this game.

Best with at least four players (I think the sweet spot is 4-5), but plays just fine with more so that's a good thing. More players typically means more horses are likely to be owned and that's important because ownership allows for a greater chance of more than one horse moving per turn, hence making for a more exciting race. Can appeal to both gamer and non-gamer alike, so this is a good one to have around as a multi-purpose game.

(If played amongst a strictly "gamer" crowd, try this variant: your Re-roll token can be used to change one of your opponent's dice as an option instead of your own -- real handy as a last ditch effort in possibly keeping a horse from crossing the finishing line for at least one more turn)

RATING: 7.7
Great family/party game, also the perfect gateaway that can be played by all (if the english text in the cards is not a problem).

The true atmosphere of a horse race, meaning there´s a lot of luck involved, of course, however, the players must try to give good use to the cards bonuses, so that they can "build" their luck. They must also keep an eye on the several horse odds, the right bettting time, the income their own horses can provide, etc.
There is also some thrill and suspense when approuching race end. This is a game that appeals to always be played!

In theory, this is an interesting game with horses jockeying, so to speak, for position as those players who bet on one set of horses tussle with those who bet on a different set. In practice, however, bets tend to be placed on the horses that take the early lead, so everyone has similar rooting interests. Also, if you own the horse that comes in first, you're likely to win.

I like the core concept of Long Shot, but the implementation seems pretty poor to me.  It seems like it should be a family game, but there is too much text on the playing cards and the horse cards to be able to easily teach the game to non-gamers.  The worst part is that the game lacks considerably on the game play side of things, so you read a lot of text, but get very little of interest to do on your turn.

Pretty much a random, all-luck race using cards and dice.  It is still fun though and would be happy to play on most occasions.  My one play was with 7 players.  I think the game tries to be filler, but lasts too long to fall into that category.

Needs more money!  Not nearly enough to pay out the winners and odds.

Very fun game.  Lots of luck, but you still don't feel like things are completely out of control.  Very nice components overall, although I wish that the board spaces were easier to see.  Also, there should have been some $100 included, as you run out of money in the endgame. (UPDATE: printed some up from the excellent file in the files section). I am impressed that every single card is unique.  

While the mechanisms don't really match actual horse racing (horses move backwards, you bet and buy horses while the race is in progress, etc), it still manages to feel a lot like horse racing.  I get the feeling that an entire racing season is being represented abstractly through the single race.  In any case, in my first play the three of us had a great time, and I'll definitely be trying this with my lunch group. (UPDATE: They love this game at work too).  

This doesn't replace my other horse racing game, Winner's Circle.  I think they are both good, and target about the same audience, but have different feels.  Long Shot is perhaps the more out-and-out fun due to all the card play.  Winner's Circle has a bit more excitement around the die roll, as you can more quickly parse what the die roll means for the board situation, whereas in Long Shot there's a delay while the current player checks their cards before the turn is resolved.

An excellent racing game with the right balance of strategy, tactics, and luck. The theme is fantastically executed. The components are very nice but we always run out of paper money at the end of the game. I've played with four to six players and it scales well. However I imagine with more than six players there would be too much down time between turns and the ability to execute a strategy would be difficult.

I'm not sure how to classify games like this. On one hand, there's a bit of strategy here since you can bet after the race starts and, in some cases, even up to the very end of the race. But on the other, there's a whole heck of a lot of take-that and chaos. With the right group and the right beverages it can be the right type of fun.

We played with 5 & 8 players.  A few thought losing a random card to an opponent didn't make much sense, but other than that the game was well received.  With 8 players obviously it will be difficult to own more than 1 horse--fewer players, better chance of owning a winning horse.  I feel the game plays best with 5 or more.

I was asked if I thought it better than Winner's Circle--I think I enjoy each on about the same level....except that, given the choice between the two, I would opt to play this one.  Being able to play 8 is a real bonus as well.  Winner's Circle only plays 6.

I don't have much interest in horse racing itself, but this is a fairly decent implementation of the theme.  The rules are simple enough to teach fairly quickly and the betting/horse buying are pretty intuitive.  I found the end dragged on a bit as it became obvious which horses had no chance.  The owner of the winner horse seemed to have a strong advantage, but more plays will reveal more subtle strategies, I'm sure.

RATING: 3
Random, chaotic, either plays out too short or too long in length. Too many unnecessary, wordy cards which you collect too many of, thus slowing down turns as players read through their cards every turn. Dice movement and turn cycle is slow and cumbersome. The game system means little if no meaningful decisions can be made due to random horse movement + random cards dealt. It also lacks any tension. Did I mention the scoring headache? no? Overall a MEH, underdeveloped and ultimately not-much-fun game. If you read a review of this and they tell you its better than Winner Circle, they are WRONG!
Go for Manilla if you want a fun, tense betting game with more meaningful decisions and a great group dynamic.

More of a thematic experience than a game, players have limited ability to effect the outcome of the game.

Horse excrement aside, Long Shot is an enjoyable, family racing game. It's pretty simple to learn & plays well with ages 8+. It's definitely more enjoyable with 5-6 players, adding more excitement. When several horses players are betting on are all several spaces from the finish line, the game is at it's best- otherwise, it can start feeling long (if only 1 horse is way out front). The theme fits the dice rolls & betting mechanics.

I like racing games, but this one seemed to have too few choices that made any difference.  Other than deciding which first horse to buy, you have very few actual decisions to make. Cards will dictate almost all of your other choices. Betting only 5$ at a time, only once a turn (if you don't play a card) on horses with highly random movement does not leave you much chance to improve your stakes using any type of skill or strategy.  Hope other people roll your horse's number enough to win. There are better horseracing games out there.
 
UPDATE after further play-- Even when I win big, my choices have almost nothing to do with it. Fun enough for a diversion, but it still rates a 5

RATING: 5
A fun betting game with one great idea (numbers on horses determine which one moves in which round) and a bit too much randomness for my taste (although it's a racing game after all so randomness is its core concept :-) .

Nice graphics, sturdy pieces and simple rules. And in spite of the randomness there is a place for tactics and some plans. It's still a betting game of course but a very enjoyable one.

Worth playing once in a while.

It's a race game, but the race is in slooowww motion. Could use some tweaks to speed up the movement and shorten playing time.

Luck of the card draw and dice rolls are definitely significant factors. A bit too much for my taste, given our experience playing it.

And, it just seems too out of theme to have horses get pushed backwards on occasions during the race. Not saying it happened to me and moved me from win to no show... :-(

A really good horse racing game. It really captures the feel of watching it come right down to the wire complete with cheering spectators (the players). Unlike a lot of horse racing games, there is a significant amount of player control. The ability to support so many players is another big plus.
UPDATE: After about 15 plays, I found myself less interested in playing this. It's very accessible, but it doesn't seem to have the depth I had hoped for at the start. It won't leave my collection since it does offer some good thrills and a flexible player count, but it ultimately is more of a filler-weight game in the time frame of a gateway game.

This game feels like Monopoly racing with betting and cards.  For some reason it reminds me of Vegas Showdown, probably the gambling theme.  At first it seemed a bit dull, just rolling and moving horses, but as you collect some cards and the game gets going, it gets a bit more interesting.

The betting is interesting but the luck makes it difficult to place good bets.  I suppose this emulates the theme well but gameplay wise it feels very random.  That's a bit of a problem, the game just doesn't reward much strategy since it's roll and move, hoping for the best.  No way to influence rolls, and only certain cards that are also luck dependent to do anything different.

RATING: 2
Infuriatingly idiotic game play. This convinces me to stay away from "racetrack" games, as so far I haven't seen any novel variation from the "roll dice/move horse" mechanic. The fact that each horse has an equal chance of moving is simplistic--you roll a D10 and D6; one of the ten horses available is going to move, anywhere from '0', '1', or '3' spaces on an oval track. There is no compensation for shorter distances in the inner track versus the outer track--each horse stays in its own track. As for the decision tree: 1) buy a horse, 2) play a card, 3) place a $5 bet on a horse, or 4) turn in 2 cards for $5. Owning a horse gives the owner some advantages, and the horse has some special 'power' or ability (if you call it that). If you happen to own some of the horses listed on the horse owner's card, they may be moved too. The horses have variable odds, but in the course of play, it becomes immediately apparent that the odds don't have any relationship to the horses' movement, except maybe in the case of their special power (which isn't invoked very often for most of the horses). The cards either give you money (either outright, or under certain conditions, or specific die rolls), allow you to place a free bet, steal cards from other players, or allow adjustment of the horses (either forward or backward). While there is some strategy in the cards, and there is a once-a-game 'reroll' token, the control is extremely limited. Ultimately, the die rolls will determine who wins, places, or shows. There are no trifectas or other betting schemes that are available in actual horse racing.

I am surprised that Z-Man games would put out such a trivial game and bother to charge money for this. Although some players found the play and unpredictability exciting, and there is a modicum of skill involved, this is a family-friendly game, especially suited for children under 10. Adults looking for some substance, like myself, may find this mildly amusing at best. Otherwise, it is predominantly luck-based. If you need control over your destiny, like I do, then stay away from this. If you want to roll some dice, win or lose primarily on those rolls, and you happen to find that simplicity exciting, well then... here is your game.

On the other hand... although I have never played it, based on reading the reviews alone, IMHO, 3M/AH's "Win Place & Show" from 1966, is a superior horse racing game that models each horse's racing capabilities realistically (showing different sprinting, mid-race, and fading characteristics), with lane changing, effects based on jockey experience, and more complex betting schemes.

Update (1/26/11): Who am I kidding? Never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

Nice little party game about horse racing.  My first game was really about trying to get a feel for it--it seems to me that the game is about timing (fittingly enough).  I think we all spent too much time playing cards and not enough betting on horses.  It's easy to do.  The ending was unpredictable--I thought I had a pretty good idea what was going to happen, but everything changed at the end.  It's short, quick and pretty random--which is just right, for what it is.  (1 play)

First played May 5th, 2010. Taught in 5min, played in an hour with 6-7 players. There is a lot of luck (die roll) in the game, however there is more strategy than meets the eye. Each player is given $50, a hand of 3 cards and the 10 horses are placed at the starting gate. The start player rolls both die (horse 1-10 & movement 6 sided dice 0,1,1,1,2,3). If a zero movement is rolled, then you steal a card from that horse owner. Move the horse the appropirate amount of spaces on the track.  If you own another horse and it has the "rolled" horse listed on the card, move it the same number of spaces.  Next you take an action: 1) buy a horse (each horse has a special ability, odds for payout, and different horses listed to move along with if rolled), 2) play a card (many different text; some break normal rules), 3) bet on horse who have not reached the "do not bet" line.  Then the next player goes.  The end of the game occurs when the first three horses pass the finish line.  Owners of the horses get $100, $75, and $50 respectivly. Players add their bets, winnings, and current cash to see who has the most money for the winner.  This is a good game to play if you know someone who has it, however I'd only suggest purchase if you really like the theme or mechanics of the game.

I enjoyed this game a lot more then I expected, probably due to its light weightness and randomness.

Your turns are actually interesting as you'll likely have at least 5-6 different options to perform between buying horses, betting, playing cards, or pitching cards for money in a desperate pinch.

Initial rating: 5.5 (August 2010)

I dislike racing games, moreover if they contain horses in it. So the theme doesn’t appeal to me in the least, the game can be fun (and chaotic) with the right crowd, but this is not a game for me. Long Shot is a great game to introduce new gamers to our hobby, but I found it to be too light for my taste, also the game has A LOT of luck (random dice, random cards) with very little strategy. The game time is too long for what if offers.

It has good components but I don’t plan to play this ever again, I can be convinced but I will do my best to avoid that fate.

Current Rating: 4.0

RATING: 7
Some call it a party game and I do not know if that is entirely true. There was a lot of math at the end of the game to see who really won with all the bets coming in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Long Shot is a briskly paced horse racing game.  The decisions aren't all that involved and there is a sizable luck factor, but the game is very welcome at my table as a 5-6 player palate cleansing super-filler played right after something intense like BSG, Through the Ages, or a heavy Eurogame.

I prefer Long Shot to Royal Turf/Winner's Circle in that Long Shot keeps me engaged during the race as well as before the race.  In Winner's Circle I often see my horses falling farther and farther behind, with no chance to catch up and no way to mitigate the situation.  In Long Shot, I'm still able to play cards, buy other horses, and/or place wagers - so even if I can't win I usually have a good time with the other decisions.

Nice, light game. Walks a fine line between real decisions and a gambling theme. Amusing experience. 

Update: I played some rules wrong so this is actually slightly less interactive than I thought (although I guess I could house-rule it). An 8 may be a bit strong, as I'd be very selective about bring Long Shot to the table. It's a great fit for certain situations, though.

RATING: 4
This was the worst non-mass-market game I've played in a long time.  Roll dice that tell you which horse to move and how many spaces.  Different horses also get to move on others' rolls. There's not much more to it.  On your turn you may also buy a horse, place a small bet, or play a special card.  There's a single set of horses with special powers that, in our play, rarely made a difference.  In the beginning you buy a horse, typically a "best" horse or one in the lead.  Later on you might place a bet.. often on a horse in the lead.  There is no positioning and very little you can discern about the relationships between the horses (unless possibly you really studied the cards).  You rarely get to make decisions and the ones you do make are tedious.

I enjoyed my first play, but I think it's mainly because I won.  It seems like I would ordinarily be somewhat frustrated with the game.  I enjoyed the game because of the people I was playing with, but I don't know if I would always enjoy playing.

The main problem I have is that it feels like it drags a little bit, as the horses make very little progress.  It's wonderful that the race is limited to a single lap (rather than multiple, like in Winner's Circle/Royal Turf), but it still feels long to me for a game so dominated by luck.

There are probably multiple viable strategies.  I don't think you need to buy a horse to win, but the betting is fairly random and you just hope you get lucky.  I guess in that respect it's just like real horse racing.

Fun, family fare that has a considerable amount of luck that is semi-mitigated into the odds and how the horses move.  Action cards also play into the game allowing you to make extra cash or move horses around a bit.  Some cards are definitely feeling a bit over-powered at times.  Still, we had a blast playing the game.  

After a few plays, I've decided that I just prefer to play Winner's Circle much more over this one.  I just wish Winner's Circle could play 8 as well, but perhaps that is what Turfmaster is for!

While our first play was with 3 and I think we need more players I think it's just a fact that racing games like this aren't really for me.

BETTING.  You roll dice to determine horse movements and have a variety of cards that do wacky things.  You can also buy horses, which increase the control you have over its movement.  Gets really intense toward the end if you lose yourself in the spirit of the game, but some players may be discouraged if they big risks and lose out early, to the point where they can't win.   But if you're always focused on maximizing your profit each turn, it's a fun and intense game.

[b]Here's our house variant.
-As an action, a player may draw a card
-Each player can perform the "discard 2 cards for $5" as a free action after the action phase (before drawing a card at the end of the turn).[/b]

Sort of tedious build up for what has the potential to be a yelly good finish. 

I think it's a little too random for the level of strategy it tries to have where I just felt pretty much helpless to actually control the outcome beyond some slight changes.

It would be a lot better if each race went a lot faster but you played a series of races so the thrilling run up to the finish line came up more while mitigating the almost totally random finishing by giving a few opportunities to make something happen for yourself.

This is a decent enough racing/betting game that plays exactly as you would expect. A lot of luck on the dice rolls, a little skill in deciding how to spread your bets, a little luck of the cards and a little skill in playing the cards. Throw in a bit of screw your neighbor, and you have a game that is predictably unpredictable and probably can get a little shouty in the right group.

It's somewhat difficult to implement a real strategy, mainly because the lead changes so often--and there are so many card plays that can set back the leader--that you mostly shoot blindly and hope to get lucky. The chaos is mildly entertaining if not particularly satisfying.

It's...well, it's a racing/betting game. If that sounds good to you, then you'll probably like it. If that doesn't sound good to you, then you'll probably feel like I do: It didn't excite me, but it was a pleasant enough diversion. I just don't need to ever play it again.

A game with a fantastic fun element! Taken for what the game is (a light roll & move race game) the game brings out the enjoyment and thrill of watching your horses charge towards the finish line (or not!).
It plays upto 8 players, so scales nicely for larger groups and the run time will not increase that much with more players.
If you want a light hearted race game with plenty of interraction then look no further!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Captures the feeling of being at the track. It's fairy quick to set up and play, it handles up to 8 players, and it is a lot of fun. It's also a game that is friendly to non-serious gamers. The rules are all printed clearly on the board, and it's theme is something that's easy to get into. 

It's a lot of fun to cheer on your horse as he races around the track and as you play cards to hinder other horses. It's a party game with just enough decisions to keep it interesting. You'll need to glue the stickers on the horses, though. They do not stick by themselves. 

Played: 10 times.

The player count and high tension on any player's turn to keep people interested is alone reason enough to recommend. Not a 'gamer's' game, but for a group of gamblers, it will do just fine.

RATING: 8
This game is really simple but a lot of fun. The game sees 10 horses take to the track and in the early game the players are likely to buy horses. There are various values and these are based on their chance of moving and the special power they have.

Each turn the active player rolls a D6 and a D10. The D10 determines which horse will move each turn and the D6 determines how far they will move (0-3). 

Money can be won for the 1st 3 horses home (hence the importance of owning horses) but as the game unfolds the players can choose to either play an action card or place a $5 bet on any horse. These bets can then earn a player money based on the odds of that horse getting on the podium.

The action cards make the game highly luck based as they can do almost anything from earn you money to advancing/setting back a horse(s).

The aim of the game is to have the most money at the end.

This game is not rocket science. This game has high levels of luck. But it is a game that can (with the right crowd) have people hollering and cheering. Not all games can do that. The nature of the game also makes it perfect for families as younger kids have a pretty even chance of beating the adults.

I have a bunch of horse racing games, and I think this one is the best.  Sure there's a bunch of luck - what would a horse race be without it? - but I also feel like I have a certain amount of control through the cards.  And with a tight race coming down to the wire, everyone is cheering each move!

Fairly random, but fun with the right crowd. I prefer Royal Turf, but would gladly play this with a group that wanted a very light betting game. If the production were better, it might improve things, too. The labels are falling off the horses and the board is poorly designed. This could have been a lot better all around with a little care for the design and thought for the rules and machanics.

Horse/bet/race game.  This game seemed to have lots of luck mixed in with some wise-play.  Perfect for a drinking night for a bunch of us gamers.  Put down money on any of the horses and push your luck to be the one with the most money at the end of the game!  

There are plenty of ways to get your horses that you own moving, but sometimes its still a wiser move to put money down on someone else's horse.

Horse race game where movement is almost completely random. Betting on horses is probably better idea than trying to get any particular horse across the line. Random cards can help other players considerably, they don't really feel balanced. Feels a bit like Munchkin, but a horse race.

RATING: 5
My rating depends on the audience.  I can see non-gamers liking this game and enjoying the randomness, especially if they're also horse racing fans.

For gamers though, this game takes the already-random horse race scenario and then ups the ante with random luck cards, ranging from practically worthless up to immensely powerful (move two horses back 2 squares each?).

From this perspective then, I must say that the game was not a hit with me.  It's too bad, I really enjoy most Z-Man games, and like horse-racing games in general.  I just can't see myself bringing this one out again except in the situation where its requested by someone else.

Badly written rules alert!   The game doesn't say how many races to run before the game is over, leaving the impression that you just run one, but on the other hand it has rules that imply there should be more than one race.

Fun horse racing game with equal parts gambling and horse movement management.  The betting element adds a bit of tension, while managing the the horses to their best effect makes for an exciting race.  The fun is in the cards, with lots and lots of different effects throughout the game.  It just seems a smidge lengthy for what it is.  I guess that if everyone is familiar with the game, it would speed up play.  UPDATE:  I still like this game but feel there is very little control of the horses.  I realize that the object of the game is making the most money but I would really like a little more horse control.

Felt that rolling a zero was anti-climatic as not having horses moving in a horse race just does not seem right. Will house-rule it to represent a 2 the next time we play but generally all 8 of us had a good time at the races. Just that it took a little too long.

Giddy-up! A trip to the horse track...that's what this game is! I wasn't sure if I was going to like it as much as Winner's Circle...but I do...in fact I will continue to play both games! This game has an awesome fresh betting mechanic, which is more like real horse-racing! It's also awfully fun to buy horses, bet on them or other horses, and play the odds! The cards are outstanding! The cards are high quality, humerous, and most importantly perfect to the game play! This game is probably best with 8 players so everyone has purchased a horse and all horses will be moving...but...I am definitely surprised at how well and balanced a 2-player game is!

Some silly fun.  A total luckfest with the card drawing and dice rolling, but still exciting.  The component quality is confusing because the cards and chits are really thick and nice, but the horse pieces and stickers are sort of crappy.  Worked decently well with 5, I may like it more with 3 players so it has less chaos and each player has a little more control.  Not bad in any way for what it is, but I can't see ever requesting it.  A great way to get the night rolling with a larger group in one game.

RATING: 6
It's a slow race as only one horse will move each turn, and then usually only 1 space (sometimes 3 or 0), Each player can also make a bet each turn, or (more usually) play a card that allows them or the horses they own (or have a bet on) an advantage. The cards are the soul of the game and there's usually something fun you can do, some screwage, but mostly positive (more money and the like). Most money wins, amd money comes from your horse placing, successful bets and from cards. Thankfully, for a game that takes a lot of turns to complete, turns are really fast so the game zips along. I didn't think there was a enough of interest there to make me want to sit through it regularly for the 60 mins that it is, but as horse race / betting games go, it ain't a strong field, and at least there was some fun along the way.

Really fun game. I totally suck at it and come in last each time, but am still wanting to play.  It's that much fun.  

Got to balance between correct horse ownership, your betting and screwing with other players and maximizing your bets at same time.

Runs from 3-6 very well. Box says will support 8. Might do more well, but thats all we've tried to far.

We've an undefeated champion in 4 games, so you can't tell me this is all about luck.

Much better than Winner's Circle. Also, no color blind issues.

RATING: 6
This game is fairly random, but good fun.  New players should be encouraged to bet on horses--it may look advantageous to collect $5 here and $10 there, but really you need to have several bets pay off to win.  Buying a horse is also good, because essentially it's a really big bet.  The cards are wildly varying in strength and the horse movement is by die roll, so you could easily be doomed by bad luck, but I think it succeeds as a short, lighter game that can accommodate a large number of people.

After one solo and one face-to-face play this seems like a very enjoyable game.  It's more than just a roll-and-move horserace, it's more of a strategy game that will take 1 - 2 hours.  Yes, you move horses (10 of them), but as they move you can buy them and bet on them, and also play one action card per turn which may help your horse(s) or slow your opponents.  If you own one of the 3 winning horses (paying $100-$75-$50 you'll probably make the most money, but with shrewd betting you can add enough winnings to win the game (winner is the one with the most money at the end of the game).

I think there are better racing games in terms of movement mechanics that feel true to the object in motion.  However, this game is much more about the horse-buying and betting than the motion.

RATING: N/A
I don't like horses, and I expected to hate this game, but I was actually pretty happy with it. This game takes the exciting parts of horse racing (betting on specific horses and cheering/jeering when your horses surge ahead or fall back) and condenses it into a simple and streamlined experience. Some parts of it make no thematic sense when applied to real life (I can buy/sell horses in the middle of the race? I can use a card to magically make the track muddy halfway through?), but they help the gameplay a lot, so I'm actually happy they made that design decision. If you can get over those little quirks, this is a fine game; definitely not a masterpiece, but definitely somewhat strategic with interesting decisions regarding which outcomes to invest in. Dice luck does matter, but you still have ways to react to it, which is key; and in a game about horse racing, it can lead to some exciting finishes. They did a great job making this game, and even though I'll never suggest it or bring it to the table myself, I can't see myself refusing a session with anyone who wants to play it.

What a fun simple game.  There is lots of variety even though the horses with the lowest odds tend to win but that is ok, cause you can bet on them and make money.  And it is the one with the most money that wins the game.  

I took off a point for component quality being bad with the stickers that never stay on and the money looking really bland.  Plus, it would have been nice to have horses with more colors or mixed colors.  Plus, when you add up all the winnings there is never enough money to go around so you have to use an adding device.  

But those are the only items I think could use improvement.  Otherwise, the game is great for a light-hearted fast playing game.  And it plays just as much fun solo or up to 8.

Great job.

A fairly fun racing game. Betting on and owning horses, while using cards to mitigate yours or your opponents horses can be fun. Often there will be loud shouts and curses as horses are jockeying for position and are so close to the finish only to see someone else emerge victorious. I think this game tends to take too long for the strategy/decisions that are available, and would rate it higher if it simply was shorter or played faster. Still I am up to play here or there as it can be reasonably fun cheering and jeering on your horse.

So here's the scenario. You are heading out to a party, or a gathering, there are people there who are not gamers per se, but you never leave home to functions without games. What do you bring? How do you interest them into your hobby? You don't want to lose people before you start, (during the rules explanation), you're not sure how many people you will be able to get to play, and you want them to experience a game where they have to make meaningful choices (not just roll and move). You have other gateway games (like settlers) but know that those can bog down especially with 4 or more people. You don't want to play yet another trivia game so you have a real problem...


Along comes Long Shot


Problem solved.


I have over 300 games. After one play with 6 I have to say I love this game.  (a great gateway game for large groups and or a gamers alternative to a party game in a party setting). It really fits a hole in my collection. It has some meaningful choices, a little bit of  screw your opponent, It plays quick, and is a familiar fun topic. (none of this, "whats a florin" or a "caballero" etc). It's kid friendly. played with kids as young as 8 and they understood it well. 

I gave it a 10 because when I need a game for the above scenario, I will always recommend this game.

This is a good press your luck strategy game.  Mechanics of the game seem to keep the game close.  Luck does play a factor but there appears to be many strategies that can win.  Sometimes down time on a players turn while looking at there deck of cards can be annoying but that likely will go away once it's played more.  This is attributed to the great variety of cards.  Overall, good game that is not great and very different than Winners Circle.

Lots of fun. The "randomness" / "unpredictably" is part of the fun and results in almost everyone still being in it till the end. Moreover, there are quite a number of tactical and strategic things [betting] one can do to mitigate such unpredictably, and thus, no way is this simply a roll and move game, though as a pure gamer's game would likely rate lower. But as a family, casual game, worthy of a high ranking. Would play this over Monopoly and true roll and move games any time.

I've been experimenting with the card mix to increase the likelihood of "action" cards coming up vs. money cards [but then you need to increase initial money for everybody]. 

I think with the right mix of cards, I would rank this game over 8.

Every game is huge fun with every group of players (from beginner to gamer). I can't begin to express how awesome this game is. The natural excitement and tension that occurs is amazing.

I'd almost always play this.

This game rocks.

Three minor changes to improve the fun of gameplay:

1) Allow a player to expend their reroll token on *any* roll, not just their own. This makes the game more fun when jockeying for 1st/2nd/3rd place finishes. Consider handing out extra tokens when there are 4 or fewer players.

2) Allow players to "turn in two cards for $5" as many times as they want in a turn for a single action.

3) Increase the per-turn bet limit to $10 instead of $5. (This also implicitly increases the "double bet" cards to $20.) This allows people who don't own winning horses to also have a chance to win.

Fun hose racing game.  Great theme and great mechanics.  You can play the role of race horse owner and horse race bettor as the horses make their way around the track.  The horses are not all equal and some will move more often than others, but will also have different odds of winning, so there is a good mix of randomness and probability to predicting which horses might win near the end.  There are also ways players can use special cards to affect the horses, so save your best actions for maximum impact.

Really Good game, really feels like an horse racing game, and good fun, and a laugh especially when my horse was turning for home (1space in the no bets area) and then my mom rolled the die her horse came up and moved once so it joined my horse. previously before her turn i had stolen her horse anixety card which said any horse move back 2 so i rolled my die and a horse came up that was in last so i played the horse anixety card and moved my moms horse back 2spaces and she left me quite a snerd comment which made me laugh even more about moving her horse back lol.

will proberly rate higher after a few more plays has i have only played once.

Fun game with big groups just b/c, after all, it is a kind of race, and it's not a cutthroat game, which makes it pleasant. Whether it's a horse race or not is another thing. Buying and betting on horses as the race proceeds, limited betting amounts, lame special horse abilities, slow, random movement, and more make me not too thrilled about this compared to the classic Win Place & Show!

Neat, quick game with a high player cap - 3 of my favorite aspects of a great game.  The bet mechanic is clean, simple & very important while you have clever cards constantly guiding or distracting you.  A blast to play but almost entirely luck-based - almost. [brotherjo]

Awesome horse racing game where you can buy horses, bet on horses, and play cards to affect the outcome. I probably like this game more than most people. Family loves this game.

It is a fun betting game.  For me it takes all the enjoyment of Royal Turf and more accessible and interactive.  Some great decisions in how you are going to spend your money.  Some cards are just better than others but it doesn't bother me too much (although if you keep drawing lots of money it may win the game for you). I'm not a fan of the move a horse back three spaces card, that seems thematically wrong to me (especially irritating that it can be played in the no bid section.

Graphic design is confusing initially as the facing of the letters make you think that the horses go clockwise.  No where in the rules does it say which direction they go.  You have to figure that out on your own.  Yes, from knowing horse racing I know which direction they go but the lettering points otherwise. Small quibble to a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
This game is a blast ... everyone loves it whether they are "gamers" or not.  Seems like a simple race game but the cards make the game come alive because they allow you to get free bets on horses and to sabotage other's hopes of winning.  Everyone feels they are a part of the game right up o the end even if they own horses that do not have a hope of winning.

RATING: 7.5
A surprisingly fun race-themed game, but without all the usual race game stuff: no lane changes, no jockeying for position (other than advancement down the track), no bottle necks, no obstacles. Instead, you have a lot of random/chaotic stuff happening on the track -- dice rolls to determine which horse moves, and how far; and tons and tons of cards that move horses forward or backward 1 to 3 (which is a lot on this track) spaces. 

But it all seems to work because of the other part of the game -- making money. You start the game with $25 and some cards. In addition to manipulating race positions, the cards can randomly give you more money, or allow you to place bets on (often random) horses. You use the money to buy horses (10 available), which will help those horses race better (owned horses are much more likely to move from dice rolls) or to place bets (each horse pays various odds if they win/place/show). You also get a big payoff if your horse finishes 1st-3rd. And since most money wins the game (horses owned at the end are worthless; only cash on hand counts), there's a lot of activity going on other than moving horses down the track.

But the money stuff also seemed to be somewhat too random, at least in a 3er game. If you don't draw cards that give you extra money, you'll have a hard time buying horses. If you can't buy horses, it'll be difficult to get multiply payoffs for win/place/show. Of course, you might be able to make up for that by betting correctly; but the race is random enough that it seems tough to figure out who to bet on!

I'd like to play the game with more players -- that should spread out the cards, and the horses, and make for an even more exciting game. Even with 3, though, this was a lot of fun!

--- Turn Summary ---
1. Use any special powers on your horse(s)
2. Roll d10 (determine which horse to move) and d6 (0-1-1-1-1-3); move the horse forward that many spaces. If any of your horses also move on that number, advance it the same number of spaces.
3. Take an action (play a card, discard 2 cards for $5, place a bet on a horse, buy a horse, or pass).
4. Draw a new card, and pass the dice.

Play until 3 horses cross the finish line (1st/2nd/3rd get $100/$75/$50 in winnings), then pay off all bets on those 3 horses (all other bets lost to bank). The player with the most money wins.

Sure, there is plenty of luck with the cards and the dice rolls.  On the other hand, the sport of kings contains plenty of luck, so it fits right in with the theme :)  There are some interesting decisions and the economic system here is surprisingly appealing.  I love this game.  I do wish the horses came pre-numbered instead of having to apply stickers and there isn't nearly enough money, which could easily be solved by including denominations higher than $20!  Those are minor quibbles for a very fun game that is part strategy and part light party game.  I have a hunch that it will work best with 3-4 players since there's more action for each player.  I should point out that I used to love racing Monopoly tokens around the board as a kid and keeping statistics (that might explain much more than I want to know), so this game is right in my sweet spot.  Giddyup!

This is a fun, light, quick-playing game that handles up to 8 players.  There are a few "gambling on the horses" board games floating around, and while this one works well for what it does (if you're not averse to total randomness), I'm not sure that it's the best of the genre (Winner's Circle is certainly better).  Components-wise, the horses look good, while the rest of the bits 'n' pieces are average at best.  While I enjoyed the game and would play it again, I wasn't blown away by it and wouldn't seek it out.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

Random things happen and then somebody wins. With the full eight, random things are likely to happen for 90+ minutes, far too long for a game of this kind -- i.e., another one that suffers from 7 Wonders Syndrome: it's only ever suggested when there are enough players for two groups, in which case it's not worth playing at all.

Not in the same league as Royal Turf/Winner's Circle.

RATING: 7
Very chaotic, but it almost seems welcome in a game like this.  For 5+ players, it seems like players should get more actions during their turn, otherwise there is not enough time to accomplish anything, or to capitalize when the race starts taking shape.  If it was in a smaller box, I'd definitely keep it in the collection, but for a box this big, it is more of a hassle to bring it anywhere and might not stick around after a few plays.

The beginning of the game is a bit of a crapshoot, where players are just getting money before they can see what's likely to happen before using more powerful cards.

A lot of the cards are near useless.  Why do I care about moving the horse(s) in last place once it's clear they will not win?

I love a good horse racing game and this one combines mechanics from Jockey with other less explored track-going fun for an attractive package.  This is the only game I bought at Origins and I'm not disappointed.

Yes, this is full of luck. But it's fun! You can play with a group. I think it'll make a very nice (slightly heavier) party game. My only reservation is that it seems on the long side for a luck-based horse race game.

RATING: 7
There is a certain amount of arbitrariness in this game, but I think it works here since there is a certain amount of arbitrariness in real horse racing as well.  There are cheers and groans as one horse surges ahead only to be caught by the pack later.  There are a lot of action cards to read for a family friendly game, so that may or may not be a problem depending on the crowd.

There's an awful lot of busy work and downtime here for a game whose outcome is nearly random.  There are enough statistics and special features on the individual horses for 90 minutes' worth of mathy decisions.  Just remember: that's all THEME.  Long Shot is a [high-end] roll-and-move.  If you can accept that, you may enjoy it.

You only move a horse you own when you are rolling the dice. You only move a horse you own when YOU are rolling the dice. YOU ONLY MOVE A HORSE YOU OWN WHEN YOU ARE ROLLING THE DICE.

I have played this game on four different occasions and each time I forget that rule. And it is a BIG rule, because the game goes very fast if you move all horse bonuses whenever they are rolled. Too fast. The game doesn't develop. 

Even worse, it makes the favorites almost unstoppable. When they move on so many rolls there is little chance for the averages not to work in their favor.

So, I have yet to play correctly. So I cannot rate the game. From what I've seen though it looks like a good one. We've actually had good fun even though I broke the game.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

RATING: 7.5
Long Shot is a light family-friend horse racing game that offers a number of different paths to try to mitigate the randomness to win big. The ease of game play and simplicity of the rules makes the game very accessible to casual and non-gamers alike. While the game can play up to 8 players, downtime and the change in odds that occurs makes it less suitable for a "party game" and more suitable for a "family game" of 5 players. While some will be turned off by the randomness and lack of real strategy in the game, if you can get past that, you will ultimately see the fun in the game and capture just a bit of that excitement in the final stretch where almost anything can happen.

Try to manoeuvre both your own horses and those you've bet upon.  Long Shot does a good job of re-creating the boisterous atmosphere of a track.  We played with 5P, but I imagine with 8P it would be a truly raucous affair.  The cards provide opportunities to create clever, game-changing gambits if played at the right moment--especially with the one-time-only re-roll token thrown in.

Like all dice games, this one has a strong element of luck attached to it. However, the nature and theme of the game of horse racing actually fits the mechanics quite well. Distribution of dice rolling suggests that this game will be quite tight in the end and the cards will ensure favorites surge ahead. However, that said, the end game is still pretty unpredictable and certainly very luck dependent, especially when a three is rolled on the movement die. Still, with enough trash talking and a lively party atmosphere, this game has its place in any game collection. Recommended to fill in the gaps and is one of the heavier racing game I own.

I did the maths/stats on the horse prices, odds and prizes and they are wildly inconsistent. Some horses are mostly useless not worth buying/betting on at all except if they have a big lead near the end of the race, and other horses are much more likely to win than their premium price. A wildly random luckfest of a game disguised by layer upon layer of unnecessarily complicated and fiddly mechanisms, and it is "broken" in that if you know the real, inherent odds for and values of the horses you should have a big advantage. - Buy Winner's Circle or TurfMaster instead - both vastly better games, and Winner's Circle is both much simpler and much better and much faster and much more fun for casual gamers as well as for hardcore gamers.

This will probably never turn out to be a favorite game of mine, nor will I request to play it a lot, but I can't deny that this game is a lot of fun.  Even with the swings that come out of the card deck -- a lot of opportunities to get money is completely random, and the chaos of stealing cards is a little aggravating -- the game elicits everyone cheering for their horses, and groaning when something bad happens to them along the way.  Hardcore gamers might not like it a lot, but those who can cut back and relax time and again should find something to like in the game.

Long Shot is the closest thing in my collection to a party game. I say this because the game moves incredibly fast, so that no one ever gets bored, not even when playing with the full compliment of 8 players. Long Shot is also completely chaotic, which again, makes it perfect for larger gatherings where more strategic titles are simply too difficult to concentrate on. The only victory condition is finishing with the most cash. Fortunately, the game offers so many paths to making money that everyone stays involved, even if their horse is a stinker. You can bet on horses, buy horses, or just sit on your nest egg and do your best to hold back all the horses that have big bets on them...I've seen all of these strategies work. The horse races themselves are a nice balance of control and randomness that make almost every race interesting. Long Shot is never going to be labelled as a brain burner, but it sure is a lot of fun!

Any game my wife requests to play more than once (and I don't hate) gets a TEN from me.
She loves this game, and I actually like it, as well.

A little too reliant on dice rolls, wasn't that much fun. Probably wouldn't play again.

A solid party horse racing game that provides just as much fun as The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game but plays up to 8.

A really light, luck based horse racing game.  More of a party game than a strategic game.

Weird thing about this game, it always feels a bit too long. But at the same time it feels too short? Probably because as soon as you get in or near the no bets zone, everyone wants to slow things down. Last 1/4 of the track takes as long as it does to get around the rest of the track.

It's fun, but you look up and realize it's been 2 hours.

What happened exactly?  There was an excuse for this "class" of game (complete lack of player control) 30-40 years ago, but certainly not now.

And don't get me wrong.  I like beer, and I like pretzels.  But what I don't like is having an unpleasant combination of the two shot up both nostrils with a high caliber machine gun.

This game is one of my family's favorites. It's a lot of fun. However, there are games that people leave the table feeling hurt after someone played a mean card against them. My mom still says she hasn't forgiven me for doing that to her in our last game. LOL. Make sure that your gaming group has semi-thick skin and you'll have the time of your lives.

This was not on my list to try.  I'm not even considering buying it which is a huge surprise for me as I'm not at all into betting or this particular theme.

Not my cup of tea.  Very simple horse racing game.  Win, Place, and Show is a far better option.

Great game for up to 8 players and light enough for newbies to get into with it's fantastic theme. We modified the rules a bit (due to my messing them up the first time) where the horses move one space on every turn if the number on their owner card is rolled, instead of only on the owners turn. That speeds the game up and makes it a bit more unpredictable and for our game group, a lot more fun.

Light-hearted and accessible game that makes a great first impression and continues to deliver a great experience after that. One of my new favorites. It can run long by about 10-15 minutes or so, but there's plenty of tension and interaction.

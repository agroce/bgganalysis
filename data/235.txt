RATING: 6
Played with three new players, a very long experience.  

But going into an older Avalon Hill game, this is what I expected and wanted.  I liked the game, with its unique turn sequencing a real radical decision on the designer's part, which hasn't been emulated in any other game I've played.  

The Action cards are the engine of the entire game, and it's sort of a marvel of ingenuity how much fits on a card and that so much is contained in that one deck.  

A finicky affair, with lots of chits in cups and constant administrative board clean-up and placement, but also fairly fun.  I don't know when I'll play it again, it being what it is, but it was definitely easy to pick up the rules after struggling through a few turns. 

I found it surprising how difficult it was to upgrade your starting ship, and a variant I've read gives another chance to do so, which is probably for the best.  It's also surprisingly deadly, with a random storm while in coastal waters an almost assured death, and mutiny always threatening to cut short a pirate's career.  

It almost has a kind of "one hit point" thing going on, that's also in games like Space Crusade, where you won't suffer much damage at all (possibly only one or two points from trying to capture merchant ships), and evading with ease the King's Commissioner and Warships, until the turn you don't, and end up getting blown to pieces.  

But since each player can sail 3 different pirates, this fragility is built into the game.  

Anyway, I enjoyed it and would definitely give it another go--it took a long time, but knowing the rules would speed it up considerably, and it offers something fairly unique.  

Having not played the remake, I can't really comment on it.

Enjoy the game, but the manual can be a nightmare.  Finding specific rule information is like digging on a desert island for a pirate stash--you might find it, or maybe not.  Feels less claustrophobic at times compared to Merchants and Marauders, but this can also make for lots of turns with little action.

Wow!  What a game!  It captures history quite nicely, has excellent chrome without going overboard, and drips with theme.  Arrrrghhh!  :arrrh:

This isn't like those wimpy Eurogames with wooden cubes, pasted on themes, and a pirate on the cover of the box.  In this one, you raid shipping lines, honk off countries, dodge warships and King's Commissioners, seek ports from countries you haven't honked off with pirate friendly governors.  You find hostages, torture them for information (and hopefully not kill them) and use that information to raid a coast and ransom the hostages.  You have to move to shore to repair your ship and get your crew to port for revelry and debauchery to keep their spirits up, let they mutiny on you if they aren't suffering from scurvy.  So much pirate goodness and badness is packed in this one box. 

You don't see a lot of pirate games and I doubt you will see any that stay as true to reality as this one.  Just be sure to get this edition: I have heard the GMT reprint is a big dud.

Un par de partidas no registradas.

Tuve la versión antigua de Avalon Hill y me pareció farragosa hasta el extremo. 

Aunque en un primer acercamiento el juego parecía magnífico, en la práctica la microgestión, la multitud de excepciones y reglas poco intuitivas lo hacen muy poco ágil. Como consecuencia me resultó un suplicio desde el principio. Y eso que estoy hablando de una época en la que la oferta de juegos era mucho menor que la de ahora...

Tampoco acabo de comprender como GMT ha reeditado este juego que desde luego pertenece a otra época (las ventas además creo que no han estado a la altura, cosa que no me sorprende).

Highly thematic but did not have enough interesting decisions for me. Too much is left to chance. It was annoying that warships that captured pirate ports converted them to English ports and no other nation's. We made up a rule for that on the spot basing it on the nationality of the ships that captured the port. Production quality is of course not comparable to newer game but, the map was mounted and serviceable.

RATING: 6
This game's strong side is the historical aspect. The weak sides are: as a player you don't know when your next turn comes around. I have never played this game except solitaire, but I would think that the game would quickly become boring with 4 players since a player may actually never get to do anything!

Additionally, the rules are pretty confusing, and takes a couple of readings to understand.

An old but very good game, the searching for the merchant ship are nice, and the game mechanics are ok. Only the turn system, that are random, for me are not so good, sometimes a player wait too long to play, and for this it's very difficult to use other ship that your own, an example when you gain a Corsair ship, if you use the Corsair you move only this, and to move your pirate, you have to wait another turn. But the game are very good.

A unique and interesting game of pirating on the high seas.  This game has it all, from scurvy to mutinies to individual duels between pirate captains.  And what a list of captains: Jack Rackham, Bartholomew Roberts, Captain Kidd, the sadistic-looking Eddie Low and of course that most infamous sea dog of all, Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard.  There are so many interesting things about this game, it's tough to list them all: a wonderful map, showing several of the seven seas, including the highly-lucrative Caribbean; the queen's pirate hunters; the different types of ships, including the mighty three-masted!  My only complaint at all about this game is the static nature of the merchant ships; and I've fiddled with ways to have a few of them moving around.  An excellent game; I might some day up my rating to an 8.

I absolutely love this game! If you are interested in pirates at all and are looking for a GREAT solitaire game you can't go wrong here. There is so much to do from attacking merchants to sacking ports to attacking other rival pirates with your King's Commissioners! This game has become very addictive to me. I can't get enough of it and find myself playing for hours before I can find a stopping point so that I can sleep (at least a little that night!). Don't listen to the naysayers about the confusing rules. I found them easy to read and reference when I needed them. The rules easily became second nature and the game flow was quick and fun! I would rate this game an 11 if I could. Read my Session Report for a small example of what a Blackbeard game can offer.

Original Avalon Hill edition.  Lots of good memories of playing this with salt-n-vinegar potato chips and some rum.

The only Berg game that ever gave me pleasure.  I credit Don Greenwood for his development - moving a lot of stuff onto the cards, rather than endless rolling on tables.  Flipping cards feels like doing something, even if it's fairly mindless most of the time.  If this game was computerized, you would have little to do, and could probably play it in 15 minutes.

Doesn't work with 4 players, downtime between your turns can be enormous.

This game is literally dripping with theme. It takes a while to play, and due to the turn mechanism there could be a lot of downtime, especially with four players. Could have used some more cards, as the deck has to be reshuffled all of the time. Best solitaire or as a 2-player game.

Gameplay is a 5, but Solo and the theme add an extra 2.  Warship sightings are gamey, no player reaches 100 notoriety and usually last pirate standing is the winner.

Have it only played solitaire so far. Rules look more intimidating than they actually are and a lot of them just can be omitted. Feels like a board-version of the computergame "Pirates!" and is more of a pirate simulation than a game. I would like to play against human opponents very much - might rerate it then.

I've owned this game (simulation?) for nearly 20 years. Pull it out once in a while and play solo. I have mixed feelings. I love pirates and like the simulation aspect of the game, but it can take a long time to play (many hours) and the rules are long and complicated. I rarely have time for that these days. Most games end when the evening runs out, long before the game would be over on its own. Still, I enjoy it. It isn't as hard-core as a true war game from Avalon Hill, but it is a quality simulation of the pirates life from the pre-computer era.

Want to be a pirate? Play this game. It's got everything pirate life was about. Capturing ships, attacking harbours, contracting crewmembers and avoiding pirate-hunters (KC's).

Player-interaction is close to non-existant. And like in the real world: a pirate's life wasn't always that exciting. Sailing from the Carribean to East Africa takes ages and isn't exactly exiting...

Only played solo, but it is a blast.  The deck can be frustrating, not goving you movement, but allowing the KC's pursuing you multiple moves.  I don't much care for the fact that luck is the sole determinating factor that allows you to upgrade your ship, in fact the game is very luck dependent, but it is still great fun.  Not a great deal of strategy or deep thinking going on here.

RATING: 6
I always thought this was a decent game but I could never get anyone really interested.  The fact that one person may get 6 turns in a row bored people and turned them off from the game.  Maybe a house variant could change this...any suggestions?

Update:  Playing this many times with the official solitaire rules, I found the game to be predictable and rather annoying.  Playing two "dummy" pirates, you essentially spend 2/3 of your time taking actions you have no stake in.  But I have found that the games tend to be hard fought contests for the first 35 notoriety points.  However, after that, the dummy pirates routinely have two KCs in operation and take the majority of their turns with them.  So their pirates stagnate and four KCs begin an endless chase after Blood for the rest of the game.

I found the game to be best when played with two pirates with either 1 or 2 players.  It's easy to act in the best interest of both pirates as a solitaire player and it makes the game more of a race.  My last game ended when the fifth pirate died on their first turn AFTER using cunning.  I should write up a session report for that game.  It was the best.

Fun pirates game from Avalon Hill, let down by a massive and wordy rulebook.  Players play historical pirates and romp around the world gaining plunder.  Turns are activated by a brilliant, ahead-of-its-time, card draw system, which means four player games can drag a bit.  Still, lots to like here and theme oozes from every leaky hull.  It's all here - merchants, attacking and sacking ports, taking hostages, ransom, loot, debauchery, duels, alliances and so on.  I have had a lot of fun and laughs with this over the years.  One of Richard Berg's more innovative and better games, but I suspect he doesn't know it.  An order of magnitude better than the amazingly bad GMT reprint, and twice as good as the slow moving Merchants & Marauders - which appears to lift a lot of Blackbeard's concepts.   This is THE pirate game.

A good game, handicapped by too much rules/subrules. Improved them, with a refresh in the materials (above all cards) and not too much thinking by the players (after all, pirates weren't great strategists, and this is a simulation: play it by istinct!), this game would deserve a better treatment!

RATING: 7
There's a lot to like about the game but overall I think it falls too much on the simulation side. Pirates have a romance about the lore, they have risen above the true history of them and reaching an almost mythical status, and this misses that element. It isn't a swashbuckling adventure, but rather a constant struggle to find ships to raid.

RATING: N/A
I have some sort of a weird Pirate fixation. I spent a good deal of money for a new-in-box version of this game (2nd edition). I set up the board, tried reading the rules, and decided to just learn by playing. The girlfriend and I donned out pirate gear and set for the high-seas. We got about two turns into the game before being utterly confounded by the rules. By that point there was a fair share of rum and wine consumed, and the rules began to make less and less sense. We then began real D&R and forgot about the game. I have since tried reading one page of the rules a day; even this is almost too much for my small brain to handle. This game seems geared more towards accountants than those of a piratical persuasion.

Way too many rules and chits. The board looks pretty but wasn't glued well at the folding portions and looks in danger of falling apart. Too bad, I really want to like this game.

Blackbeard is a really good game.  It is a long game, but it is good.  One problem is that there are not enough cards in the deck.  Due to the reshuffling that has to be done, it would be better if there were double the amount of cards.

[Pirates] [3P:3] As an idea, Blackbeard gets high marks. If you're really interested in a pirate *simulation* then this will hold value for you (it's be a 7 or 8 if that's what you're looking for). If you want a pirate *game* then you should look elsewhere, as Blackbeard is barely playable. In the tradition of Berg's designs, Blackbeard's chrome is overdone at the sacrifice of most of the game's playability, timing and rhythm. I understand that this can be played solitaire, but for that kind of entertainment I'd turn to a computer game (Sid Meier makes a kickass pirate game). Boardgaming is about playing with other people, and that's something that Blackbeard does not do well at all.

Actually not that great a game, but I can't bring myself to rate it lower.  My nephew lent it to me to learn the rules.  It suffers from the problem most old AH games have, an over complicated badly ordered rulebook.  It seems tough to actually get anything done in the game or have direct conflict with another player.  That could just be a familiarity issue.  I wouldn't turn a game of this down, of course I'd probably have to re-read the rules.

I am not sure why this game generates the reputation it does for being complicated and overly fiddly.  I have always found Blackbeard to be the best of all pirate games, and quite intuitive as well.  After one is able to decipher their way through the typical jargon of ye olde Avalon Hill rule book a fluid, well designed, historically faithful game of piracy emerges.  The turn order mechanic adds a lot of flavor to this game, although it has been critisized for causing unbearable downtime - I have yet to experience this. The decisions one has on any given turn are not overwhelming so therefore actions are resolved rather quickly preventing said downtime.  The small nuances like falling ill with scurvy, the potential for mutiny, and the choice to push the luck of your privateer as he ages for one last bounty make Blackbeard a colorful experience game.  When I feel the need to hoist sails in search of adventure Blackbeard usually gets the nod. The addition of a strong solitaire game just makes it that much better.

Just a disclaimer, I love pirates and I love the Caribbean.  I know all its geography and much of the history of the area especially from this era of the Spanish Main.  I also loved the Sid Meier's version I played on the Commodore 64, which was possibly one of the best games for the long dead platform.

Well this game is sort of like playing pirates again on a board.  A major complaint of this game is the rules, its actually not that bad really, you'll get over it and find a gem of a game.  Like most naval games like Silent war or tokyo express, expect periods of inactivity with periods of astonishing excitement.  That was what life on the main really was like and I just can't get enough.  

I have play this game only Solo by the way so the rating is solely based on my solo experience.

I bought it when it came out and couldn't wait to play.  My wife indulged me with some friends and we lapped it up for 4 weeks.  Other games came into the gaming-gang and it was forgotten.  I recently opened it up again and got a thrill again.  Solid game, but too much down time.  And like many AH games loooonnnnng!  Too long for modern day 30+'s who recall this game.  It's worth it second hand at around $15.00-$20.  And buy it if you like SOLO!

Like all AH games it requires decication and patience, the reward is a very deep game.

This game is best played with gamers entirely familiar with the exotic and labyrinthine rules and game mechanics. Very colorful with options that put you in the shoes of a Caribbean/Gold Coast/Indian Ocean Pirate captain; Will you torture your captives for the entertainment and edification of your crew? Allow you crew a little drunken debauchery to keep them happy? Let that plum treasure ship slip away because yours is still too damaged from your last attempt? Seek out and challenge a rival captain to a duel? My eyes were opened after a game at the WBC in which the guy handling the deck moved things along quite rapidly thus minimizing the down time when other players get a run of cards. You MUST invest the time to learn the convoluted and obscure rules exceptions to enjoy this game, otherwise don't bother.

Haven't played the reprint.  Good pirating sim with quirky rules that mean the same player may get to go multiple turns while everyone else waits.  Very hard to win, but so was pirating probably.  Not a lot of player interaction.  Fun to play solo, though and has lots of theme.

I love the Pirates subject - but this was extremely annoying. Played it 1 time - with 3 - was sitting in a port and had a downtime of about 45 minutes! as all the cards what would activate me were used for activities of my opponents. So a hunter had endless time to approach and after those 45 minutes, he sunk me while I tried to escape. Extreme bad luck? Maybe - but I never touched it again.

Multi-player game where each player gets to be a pirate, plundering merchant vessels and other fun stuff. Unfortunately, the game is *not* very fun, but instead dry, long and cumbersome.

I think this game inspired Sid Meier's Pirate computer game.  The rules are hard to read and decipher and there are lots of little things you can miss.  Auctual gameplay is fairly simple and fun as everything relies on the cards.  Doesn't seem too balanced for multiplayer, as certain zones where players can start seem unbalanced in what the plunder rewards are in relation to other areas.  Neat solo play capability.

**A Great Pirate Simulation Game!** 

This is fun solitaire and a very good game of real piracy; it's not light, fluffy, or romantic--we're talking blood and guts, waiting out the doldrums, torture, mutinous dogs, King's men coming down on you, ports turning on you, the risk of death by disease, plunder, sacking, cannons, sailing, the chase, the rabbiting, the resources dwindling, and other pirates vying against you. 

The rule book could use some streamlining and some new presentation by today's 'euro' game standards, but I grew up Avalon Hill games and wargames and RPGS, I guess I'm used to lots of rules and don't find them daunting really. 

I've been toying with undertaking that re-presenting of the game and coming up with some playing aids. **UPDATE** Don't have to do this redesign...it's coming from GMT Games: Available in their project 500 as of March 2007!

This one should get more play than it does; people are scared off by the cardboard chits and the "old Avalon Hill" feel. They're wrong. It's a good game, but won't be for everyone.

Many will be looking for a game like Pirate's Cove (a good rowdy time, and a fun lighter game) or Plunder. Plunder is high on my to try list...if it's really akin to the PC Computer game "Pirates" of yore by Sid Meir, I'll love it. But, for a game of piracy, for a game of Aubrey and Maturin, for a game of the seas and villainy...this is the best so far.

Don't think of Johnny Depp, think of the bodies swaying above the tide lines at the end of ropes on the banks of the Thames or off the shore of some Caribbean island, think of knowing your fate is such and you're trying desperately to keep your neck free of the noose.

I have always been a fan of Avalon Hill games and this has all the components to be an awesome game, but the game mechanic seems broken to me. If memory serves, you use a card deck to determine the events of your turn. But instead of flipping just one card for all the events of a turn, you have to draw multiple cards from the same deck in sequence for every action of your turn which ends up meaning a lot of card shuffling as you burn through the deck fairly quickly. Maybe I wasn't playing correctly, but I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are very good at creating alternate game mechanics.

Additional Information
My brother and I tried this because we forgot why it was so bad. As soon as we first moved, we remembered. Some players NEVER move. In theory it should be equal, but EVERY TIME WE PLAY, one player gets all the moves and another gets NONE. Also, if a player controls a King's Commissioner, the pirate cannot run away no matter what. Pirates need more actions (Attack, Fix, D&R, Sell, etc.) whereas KC's only move and destroy. Doesn't help that their numbers are outrageous. So overall it's a sucky game. Cool theme, but [b]game mechanics will bore you to tears.[/b]

I'd probably rate it a 2 if there were female pirates, but no this game is sexist.

Blackbeard.. Now there's a pirate game, matey! 
It's quite difficult to survive, hard to win, tiresome to rule-read (A lot of paragraphs with cross references!) but still FUN to play. Great card mechanism which can create envy or malicious gloating, depending on the circumstances! Love the idea of drawing a pirate to take over the ship after a mutiny or other misfortune... Great theme, so-so components, fun solitaire.
This is mostly a simulation of the Buccaneer era, not so  much an action game. Not much player interaction, but I highly recommend it, especially for 3 swashbucklers!!!

Well, OK. The randomness of the warships is a little annoying, and there's a lot of 1d6-rolling to see how your characters do, but little variation among the captains. I wish your captain's skills changed - that'd be nice. Also, some of the ports are impossible to storm, so why give them defense values? 

It's a nice, chromy game, and when you have a little grog handy, it's a lot of fun, but don't expect any direct competition; it's almost solitaire.

We enjoy this game, although it always seems that with 3 or 4 players, one of us ends up watching everyone else play.  My wife always seems to luck into a Brigantine very early in the game, allowing her to coast to victory.

I don't much care for the little numerical counters, although I guess they are better than having a consumable pad of scoresheets.

It feels like multi-player solataire.  One of the big problems is that you have to wait a random amount of time between turns.  you might go back to back or you might just be watching for an hour or so.

In the 3 or 4 times I played this, I never saw anyone amass enough points to win.

The game isn't really that heavy, but the rulebook for some reason just doesn't make sense the first few readthroughs.  Then it all suddenly becomes clear and the game is pretty easy.

Wanted it because of its high solitaire suitability.  As a game, it casts great doubt to be good for face-to-face play, especially with the downtime problem as some have encountered.  To me, pirates sell me too!  This game has the same exact area of operations as to Sid Meier's Pirates! PC game.  I will look for Sid Meier's Pirates boardgame coming out as a subsitute to me, before bidding a copy of this from eBay.

The BEST (overall) pirate-themed game I've played.  Not a good multiplayer game but plays very well solitaire and is ok with 2.  The rules are not complex but dense.  I played it so many times in the past and feel that it deserves a high rating even though the game mechanics aren't as elegant or nifty as many of the newer games.  It's just one of those great older games that made itself more and more worthwhile over time.  

Am very excited to get the new edition of this game!!!

This isn't a bad game but despite the detailed rules, your options are somewhat obvious which is a little limiting.  Furthermore, the randomness of the booty values generally means that the winner will win on pure luck and not skill.  This may mimic the reality of being a pirate but it might make for a bad gaming experience for some.

A fun game, very thematic. Seize merchant ships, sack ports, take, torture and execute hostages.

I haven't played this game in a long time.  There is a lot of rules and formulas to remember and pirates die very easily but it does give you a feeling of what it was like to be a pirate.

Not a bad game, King's Commissioners are difficult to use effectively.  Some down time- need to be able to 'get in the mood' to really enjoy the game.  Have had some great games, and some so-so games.  A lot depends on the opponents.

A game about the story. Once you get into your pirate, the game can really shine.  It is not about winning and losing, for sure.

Having played the newer edition, I wanted to give this version a try.  It reminded me of Wizards (AH), in that players can spend turn after turn building up their pirates only to have a single die roll erase that hard work, forcing them to start fresh.  The entire game results seemed overly capricious, right down to the random, asymetric turn order.  (This is one instance where the theme intended to be deliver fails to overcome the shortfall of the poor mechanic.)  Had some good points (many of which were transcribed into the new edition), but some critical flaws eliminate much of the fun.

Somehow this game takes a potentially interesting subject and turns it into an incredibly boring game.  The fiddly mechanisms (typical for Berg) and "amusing" event tables do not compensate for the excessively long length and the downtime between player turns, which can be up to an hour depending on the play of the cards.

Attempts to provide more history than most pirate games. The addition of the African coast and Indian ocean maps is a good idea (Piracy wasn't just the Caribbean), but somewhat superfluous. Not entirely sure why you have to move your full move when searching - no dawdling in this game.

Molto ben calato nell'ambientazione, già di per se' molto affascinante, è anche graficamente bello a vedersi. Molto interessanti - e forse innovative ai suoi tempi - le azioni card-driven (è il primo del genere?) che consentono uno svolgimento non sequenziale: è vero, qualcuno rischia di star fermo troppi turni, ma senza questo meccanismo avremmo avuto un giocone dell'oca a tema piratesco. Blackbeard prevede tutto quello che troveresti in un vecchio videogioco sui pirati (abbordaggi, attacco di città, malattie, duelli, cacciatori di pirati, lettere di marca, ostaggi), per cui l'effetto nostalgia è ancora più amplificato. E' grandemente influenzato dal culo, ma l'assenza di alea in un gioco con questo tema avrebbe forse stonato. A voler trovare qualche difetto, forse c'è poca interazione tra i giocatori, e le mappe periferiche rischiano di essere poco utilizzate. E poi, il sistema di gioco, fatto di tanti calcoli e tabelle, sente tutti gli anni che ha: per evitare tempi morti, meglio giocarlo con una persona che conosce a memoria ogni singola regola.

RATING: 6
This was my first CDG and the cards got pretty dog-eared as you run through the deck every turn. Players play pirates and also pirate catchers trying to stop the opposition. I found the best way of making money was to loot the Spanish coastal towns. Nice morale system as the crew's unrest goes up regularly and unless you give them plenty of loot, drink and women they will mutiny. In the end it got repetative - it needs a larger deck - and I sold it off.

Want real pirate flavor? FORGET Pirate's Cove, Blackbeard is where its at.  The game may seem a bit daunting at first, with the wargame-like rulebook, but the rules are actually quite simple and straightforward.  There's lots of random chaos and not much strategy, but then this is intended to be a realistic simulation of the pirate life.  It would be great to see a new edition of this with a bit of rules streamlining to bring it up to date.

Bought this when it was first released, when Avalon Hill games formed a big percentage of my collection.  My group of the day played it maybe five or six times but never managed to accumulate a great deal of wealth, the winner usually being the one who didn't die of scurvy! We also noticed that there was very little player interaction. I liked the flavour of the game at the time but the usual wordiness of the AH rules may well put me off these days. Nevertheless, it's still on the shelf and I might give it a solitaire outing before I make a decision whether to keep it or not.

Avalon Hill game of pirate action on the high seas.  Old school hex type game.  I found I like it.

Things I liked are the hexes and hunting down merchant ships.  The game board is really nice, the counters though are small, typical of that style. The theme is apparent and the pirates choices are great.

The rule book is packed but the game is rather light. 

The game does become tedious after awhile and can get boring because you are doing the same thing all the time.  

But overall, a good solid 7.

RATING: 8
We had a lot of fun with this one, a very interesting treatment of pirates. Be warned, however, that this is a reasonably realistic game and *not* a "Hollywood" version. Pirates did not often live to a ripe old age, and in this game just surviving is hard, let alone winning. Pure game-players will likely hate it, but those who like historical realism can find it fascinating. According to a comment from the designer on ConSimWorld, this was originally designed as a solitaire game using dice; Avalon Hill replaced the dice with the Action Cards and added the multi-player version.

This game is not everyone’s cup of tea (or rum). The unique turn system, where someone can get turn after turn in a row, is a big turn off to a lot of folks. The turn sequence is one of the things I like about it; true I have a fairly odd sense of humor. Plus it was one of the few (the only?) Avalon Hill game I could get my ex-girl friend to play with me.. so it has fond memories.

Delightful for solo play, though repetitive and gruelling at its worst (the rules even boast about the game's simulation of the periods of boredom and inaction in a pirate's !). Nice sort of game to have set up to play for half an hour our an hour then leave for the next day. Really nails the theme, very neat, intuitive mechanisms well-suited to solo play, particularly the various dice and card  resolutions.

I love these old Avalon Hill games, they look great, and are dripping in theme. Yeah, the rules are dry as toast, but once you claw through them, it's pay day!  So what can I say, pirates, ship battles, being hunted by privateers, sacking ports, can be played solitaire, this is old school greatness!

Finally played this, oh, 20 years after I bought it. The experience was not unexpected for a late 80s/early 90s Avalon Hill game: dripping with theme, unbalanced play, lots of downtime, tons of randomness, and hard to read rule book.

A 10 for theme and an innovative card driven mechanic that's ahead of its time. Minuses for kingmaking and victory conditions that makes the game drag on for too long. Players start with a random pirate (some better than others) and a sloop or schooner. They then roam around the Indian or Atlantic Oceans trying to gain notoriety and booty from plundering merchant ships and sacking ports.

As usual, once you get past the dense rules, the game plays simply. Each turn, you flip a card that determines who gets to move. The cards also determine random events and other potentially good or nasty events. The player then takes an actions (move, attack, dock, refit, sell booty, etc). TAbles and charts are all easily referred to on the board. The first pirate to a 100 notoriety wins. Alternate winning conditions: Game ends when a player loses 3 pirates and pirate with most money wins or earn more treasure than others and do a retirement roll. Well worth a look for those who like an immersive game and for piratey fans. YARRR!

Blackbeard is a great application of card driven mechanics. I think this AH version will remain the classic although I look forward to the coming remake with areas instead of hexes.

RATING: 6.5
Of course, it may be totally random, but man is it cool.   What a classic.  Three players, three pirates, two out at a time is the only way to go.  Otherwise good luck seeing your turn.   Make sure that you play with quick draws or the game can really drag. Speed through the cards for fun piratey action.

The best way to play is to remember that it is mostly random and you are just nudging the game in your direction.  Play until one player stops having fun.

UPDATE: Now that Merchants and Marauders exists, there is no reason to really play this anymore.

My wife and I played this one last night.  The first couple of rounds were a bit rough, but after we got the basic rules down, it went a lot smoother.

Far superior to the "redone" GMT version. I really like the random turn order system, which makes it possible for any ship to catch up to any other ship, so can never be assured of safety. Just managing to retire at all is a marvelous feat, it most often comes down to who dies last.

I would rate this a 8 for solo play, but I have not played a multi-player game.  I give it an overall of 7 as a hedge against the problems others describe for multi-players as I can see those things being a problem, too.  Maybe that is unfair, but I can't imagine I would always want to play this game multi-player.

This has all the chrome you would probably ever want from a pirate game and, along with Ambush!, it is top 2 of all solo games I have played.  The rules are a bit to wade through and there is a tremendous amount of re-looking things up when you start, but once you get the rules down the game does move along quite nicely.

Great solo game, but also worth owning as it is the best pirate game out there and it could be a lot of fun for multi-player.

Read some of the session reports. Very entertaining.

Update: Another game I really enjoy, but doesn't see much play. A lot of overhead. I will never get rid of it as it is still fun when I do play. 

Merchants and Marauders is almost certainly a better multi-player experience. I have only solo-ed M&M but that is enough to convince me. Blackbeard is now just a solitaire game for me.




Suitability for Travel:

Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1

Despite its burdensome mechanics and well-attempted-but-flawed turn order system, the game is still fantastic. If you want a "Pirate Simulation", this is it. The inclusion of the other major pirate waters besides the Caribbean (Indian Ocean, Gold Coast) also makes this game stand out. The difficulty also suits the theme well--a pirate's life is not easy.  However, make sure you are energetic before playing and it helps to have another person very familiar with the rules who can help keep the cards going, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is about as realistic as a pirate game gets in board form. Swashbuckling adventures and treasure maps won't be found in this box, but that's not to say it lacks excitement. Players spend the game hunting merchants, evading King's Commissioners (controlled by other players), and trying to survive until retirement to enjoy the booty "earned" throughout the game. 

The rules were a bit cumbersome, but after playing a few rounds (with the help of a printed player aid), the game plays pretty well. Most of what you need is printed on the board, anyway. The solo dummy players work well enough, and the game seems to be a worthwhile purchase for mostly solo play. 

I don't mind the player turn randomization, although I could see some frustration during a 4 player game. Lower player counts may be best, despite the delightful chaos 4 players would bring. And this is certainly not a game to be taken too seriously, just sit back and enjoy the events that unfold.

Decided to re-evaluate this game. Now the version I'm talking about here is the Avalon Hill Version NOT Richard Berg's 'train wreck' second edition with the crappy map but neat looking cards.

Not much inter-action between players though and it feels like 5 players all playing a solitaire version of the game.

But, it is one of the few games to feature 'historically' named pirates and is closest to 'history'.

RATING: 7
I absolutely love this game (note: for the solitaire play).  Fast paced, playable and good for an afternoon!  The solitaire rules are really good.  The cards keep you guessing (and gambling) such that you never know what is going to happen, unlike most of the time when you are playing games solitaire.  Multi-player is not so good, and tends to drag if people aren't totally ruthless.  The new BB is probably better for multi-player.

This is the only game about pirates I know of that really is about pirates, as opposed to fictional Hollywood film characters (Captain Blood excepted). Extremely random, very thematic. Sort of like DungeonQuest - go in expecting the worst. Fate and the developing narrative provide the thrill. It really only works well solo or 2-player - I do not recommend this game with 3 or 4.

For some reason this game's rulebook has been tough to get through.

I like this game but the down time seems to run off potential opponents. I'm looking forward to trying the remake.

A lot of fun as a solo game. Haven't played FTF yet though.

Could've been fun, but far too many rules for too much luck

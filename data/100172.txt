I didn't Kickstart this game, although I considered it.  However, I did pick it up after a Gen Con demo.  I really enjoy this game and look forward to trying it with varying number of players.  Is it a solid worker/influence placement, with the sins (sisters) bestowing powers that make intuitive sense, even though the theme is a little wonky.  The rules are simple but the game gets complex quickly and tough decisions emerge.

I wanted to like this game, I just found me self feeling too constricted by the cards I drew to play the strategy I wanted...Also, you might want to attempt to play the path of least resistance, yet if you don't have the cards to do that there isn't much you can do about it.

Though the aspect I like least about the game are the "accidentally eff you over" mechanics. If someone purposefully messes with you because you're a threat, that's one thing...but when it happens as a byproduct of a player "having no better move" or "because it affects them least" it often feels simply unlucky and can be much more frustrating.

The "Wrath piece clearing", "Envy piece syphon" "Sloth tie breaking", and "Pride order selection" mechanics can all produce this undesirable side-effect...

to elaborate...An example is often Pride's first player choice mechanics: usually it's simply a matter of the winning player choosing to go last thereby accidentally offing someone over. It'd be more compelling you are compelled to give someone the first move because they're a threat (strategically effing someone over)...but that rarely happens. Several other mechanics often seem to end up having similar effects.

Eerder frustrerend omdat je te weinig impact hebt op wat de anderen kunnen doen.
Wel grappig concept met de hoofdzonden.

This was a very cool game.  It reminded me a bunch of Louis XIV in the way you use the cards, bring pieces into play.  The card play is great as it allows you to be creative with your game play.  It's area control and you battle versus others and there are ways to mess with people as well.  The art work on the final prototype is cool.  I love the bright colors and the look.  It plays up to six and I think it would play well from 3 to 6.  Unfortunately, I'm going to have to wait until the game is produced to play it again...so this is the first game I'm supporting on Kickstarter.  For simple rules, there gets to be some nice depth to this and some forward planning.  Be prepared to adjust your plan on the fly tho.  I think my rating will go up with more plays.

Update Sept 2012 - bumped up to an 8.  Played very well with 3.  You can be very creative in what you do in this game.  A cool game of ebb and flow and be ready to strike when you can.

Dec 2012 - 8.5 now but could go higher.  Played a three player game where we randomized the order of the Sister boards.  Wow.  It changes things up.  Not the play, but the strategy...it can make for some powerful moves with a different scoring order.  Because of that, I see this game having legs.  Three player games of this are really, really good.  It plays well up to six.  With five or six, the key is to make sure someone does not get a set as they can go a long way for someone winning. I'm seeing that the more it gets played, the more intense and creative people are becoming. 

(an aside, it seems like I'm in the minority as I really enjoy the artwork of this)

Each round, players are dealt a hand of cards which will dictate where they may place influence each round onto the 7 sisters.  Game play is very basic, with each player in turn playing a card and adding or moving some influence cubes according to the card played.

At the end of the round, the sisters are each scored.  The player with the majority of cubes on a sister gets a point, as well as a one-time special benefit from that sister (such as getting to move other players cubes, getting some resources which are useful in the game, etc).  There are some other minor quirks to this basic game play, but it's a very simple system overall.

In the end, I found this to be a solid but unspectacular area majority game.  One that works mechanically just fine, but doesn't have anything there to get too excited about.  I feel like this system could definitely have introduced some more interesting problems with a little more development, but is just a harmless, functional game as is.

RATING: 5.8
Really a retooling of Louis XIV with more chicks and no mission cards.  The art on the new edition is a bit wonky.  Some of it is really good, and some is really poor.  I like the components, but feel the gameplay is too derivative of Louis XIV to be interesting.

RATING: 8
This is a lot of fun. It does have a possibility of players ganging up on someone (we had one person play that we were getting sick of...so we blocked him on everything). Overall, the strategy element is quite fun and unpredictable since the other players can really mess up your plans when you want the same favors they do. I've had a lot of fun playing this one. Would absolutely play again.

A few years back, I was reading from geek buddies that they were enjoying this. I love area majority games, so I picked up a copy. But, it' been collecting dust.

I finally put it on the table and got it played.

Very simple game. It was interesting and would probably play it some more. But, it did seem a bit short and 'anti-cimatic.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2013)

This game was a surprise. I didn’t have any hope regarding Seven Sisters, but it is actually pretty fun. The art leaves a lot to be desired, but the gameplay is good.  The theme is also pretty weak but I like the game. Seven sisters is an area control game with hand management. It has some luck in the form of the cards, but overall, as you can use them 3 different ways (this is great), you can plan ahead and strategize your plays. I don’t feel luck is dominant in this game. The rules a pretty easy to grasp, but it has some  unexpected depth and hard decisions (a huge plus for me). Also the play time is relatively short leaving me satisfied with the game experience. 

Another cool feature is the replayability of the game, simply changing the scoring order of the sisters affects the game in different ways and new considerations and plans have to be taken into account, neat.

I think it plays very well with 3 or 4 players.

For now, I would not mind another game of this. In fact I’m thinking about buying it. Good game, better than expected.

I bought the game and I finally played it again. I still like it, but the rulebook could be better. It explains the sister´s powers before explaining how to play the game so you don’t understand it as you don’t have the context to use that information. Logically, it should be the other way around.

This is a fun euro lite game that is easy to learn and play. Player screens are very good as they have all of the info you need during your first play. I really like the art for each sister.

A pedestrian area control game where players play cards from their hands and attempt to garner the most favor with each of the seven sisters before the end of four rounds. The seven sisters are named after the seven deadly sins. Each with a unique power that the player with the most favor receives. Most are intuitive and give some benefit in resources with the exception of Wrath: who allows you to destroy all of the favor gained for one sister, Sloth: Who breaks ties, Pride: who determines the first player, and Envy: who removes the favor of another player on a different sister and brings it to her. The theme works very well in the game and it is very craft, however, the card mechanic that allows you to choose and select which sister combination you may favor pigeon holes an other wise promising game. This game could have been so much more without the need for cards telling me as the player what to do. I am very saddened by this, but could conceivably be conned into playing this game again.

RATING: 6
Area majority game with special powers for the one who has the majority on each of the seven sisters.  If there is a tie, no one gets the primary bonus unless someone has more of the sister's chips that wins ties.  Low scoring games where tiebreaker is likely to come into play at the end to determine the victor.  Not sure what to think yet, but I would like to play again.

Great game.  Great concept.  Good game mechanic.  It is very addictive.  The art could be better.  It looks good from a distance and is a great concept but up close the art does not hold up.  Perhaps when the game picks up a following another version with better art will be released.

Initial comments;
Finally got to get this played! Yah!!! and Yah! what a great game.  Everyone kept commenting about the scantly clad women hehehe.  I didn't really pay attention to the art while playing the game, I just focused on the colour of the boards.  

The game was pretty easy to teach, and we had two new gamers join us, as well as really experienced gamers.  Everyone had a lot of fun :) I really enjoyed it.  I didn't realize that there was 2 scoring rounds at the end of the 4th round, luckily Dano caught that in the rules.  That made things really interesting, as we had to think about who wanted to be 2nd as well.  

Played using the wooden gold coin tokens and the wooden apples and I don't think I'll ever use the cardboard tokens.  The wood bits are so awesome!!!  Played with 6 players, good game! But we have to find out how to managed the cubes, servants bc the shields kept falling down and somehow we ALL kept taking the cubes from behind the shields.  

I didn't explain the theme very well, but we really didn't need the theme, it was fun just trying to win the VP tokens, and trying to not get  wiped out by the Wrath token :)

Played half a demo at GenCon, then a full game a couple days after with several friends. We all pretty much liked it and will play again. Might eventually house rule this to allow a "take a card / pass the stack" mechanism like 7 Wonders has - the game might be more strategic with that option rather than a simple shuffle and deal. It was frustrating drawing a lot of cards for one or two sisters than almost none for others.

After three plays I'm beginning to get the hang of this worker placement game.  Especially important is the fifth scoring, which occurs just after the fourth.  The artwork is interesting and a bit edgy, not just the "princess" look suggested by a casual glance.  I look forward to randomizing the sisters' boards for an advanced game.  Very enjoyable.

Edit:  Upgraded to 8 after a couple more plays.

Not a horrible Euro--the area control mechanic meant that there was at least direct confrontation, but it felt very calculable to me.

Furthermore, the art and graphic design was just horrible - the drawings of the sisters looked like they were done in some high schooler's prom night sketch book.

Lastly, given the theme, the game just was not ruthless enough.

Area majority with semi-random control over where you go.

Given that description, it worked surprisingly well, but it was still disappointing.  There are some interesting ideas, but the subtlety is overshadowed by the low level of strategic and tactical control.

I found the art quite charming -- at first, I found it amateurish, but as I played I found it quite endearing.  The theme feels well integrated, even though the game itself is a bit simplistic.

I find myself wanting to like the game more than I did.

Played the prototype of this last night, and I thought that it was a good solid game. A fun spin on the theme of the Seven Deadly sins in a game, with each sister / sin representing an action that one will take, resources one will get. or a special ability that one will get to use.  Eminently a fun and quick-playing game of planning and resource management that shows a good effort of development that translates into well-balanced game-play.

A fairly overt area majority game, and while the artwork is nothing to write home about, I liked the wood components that came with this version.  Overall, this is still a fun, albeit quirky game that involves both luck, and playing off other players, trying to outguess their plans.  With very little direct attack against other players, but still loads of interaction, I enjoy this game and would definitely play again.

Wanted to like this, but it is a quite dry area control game that is mostly abstract. Going last in turn order is so strong that compensation is given to the other players.

Very cool game that fits it's theme well.  I have actually had this game hit the table a lot more than normal because there is something about it that intrigues people to want to play.  I think it is the unique artwork and theme that draws the attraction as much as the game play.  The only frustration the game presents to my gaming group is the very low scoring mechanism. Although it makes the game easy to score and very strategic, it also lends its hand to a lot of ties when players of the same skill level are playing.  Tie breakers exist, but not always fun to be playing to win tie breakers.  With that said it is yet another way this game is unique.  It is a rare gem, and one of the few still pure Kickstarter games, with a real self publisher trying to produce games.  Give this one a Try, it is definitely worth it!

Easy to learn and fairly quick to play, with a good mix of decisions.  Area majority game with bits of hand & resource management and with special actions and scoring based on winning majorities.  Theme works well (winning gluttony gets you more food), which helps to remember the favor earned by winning majority.  

I'm not a big fan of the artwork, but the components are good quality and the game is enjoyable to play.

saw a video about it, really liked the theme and artwork, took me a while to get it. Gameplay is good (not great) although there are some fiddly rules that don't make much sense.

[+] components, theme and artwork; easy to teach, fast paced, not much downtime; shuffling the sisters during setup adds replayability; 
[-] some fiddlyness especially between rounds: random tokens to get fruit/gold... everyone getting more servants with small differences for first and last players... those 2 rules could be removed/replaced by a single bonus for first player (add a free servant on any sister?); with 5/6p, almost impossible to complete a set.

RATING: 6.5
Quick and dirty thoughts:

Not bad for a first effort on the part of the company.  The gameplay is simple but has a few nuances that are worth exploring.  The random nature of the cards coming out makes this less a euro and more a bluffing game than anything else.  I downgrade half a point for a couple of rather fiddly rules that strike me as having been created in a quest for "perfect balance."

I suspect the art here is going to be very polarizing.  Some people will love it and some people with find it repulsive.  I'm sort of on the fence myself.  I can't figure out if the artist is just mediocre or he/she was intentionally stylizing the renderings in a certain manner.  Either way, the game is certainly colorful and the seven sisters jump out at you.

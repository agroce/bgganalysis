RATING: 5.5
A good, decently quick game.  The entire game portion revolves around bidding on obstacles to cross, then gaining enough tracks to cross them, while keeping enough money to buy tracks to finally win.

It's a very very simple game to learn, and it's a lot of fun to play.  Also, the game is pretty balanced- if you start falling behind, the system is designed to give you a small help in catching up!

It's pretty fun, I'd recommend it as a good filler game.

Excellent little filler. A quick mix of auction, push-your-luck and bluffing that I believe will be a big hit with C--. A tight little game with 2.

Enh?!  That's how I felt after my 1st play with 3p.  Much luck-of-draw, some strategic choices.  Good but not great.  Need to play again... and focus less on the $$ payoff of terrains and more on building fast/easy since this is a race game.

RATING: 4
This game just didn't feel right... the auctions were pretty irrelevant as the winner bid 0 on pretty much everything.   

The "hope you're lucky in turn order to complete your track" element is pretty random.

The "just sit at a river and get free cards which will allow you to vault into the lead in consecutive turns" element was pretty lame.

Also the "further you are back the more free tracks you get" element is silly, because it adds yet another incentive to not move forward.

I actually suspect that we played a rule wrong, because it just didn't feel right.

Initial rating a 4.

RATING: 6
This game has an odd cadence. Because you can lay more than one track in a row without anyone being able to interrupt you, ideally you'll have lots of spare track at the end, with plenty of money, to lay down two or three quick tracks and take the game.

So it encourages a slow start and brutally quick ending.

RATING: 3
A weird auctioning game with a great deal of luck of the draw, and a last-ditch resort when this doesn't go your way. Perhaps marginally better than many of the other Adlung card games I've played over the years... but that's damning with faint praise. The problem is simply that you cannot know how the track building is going to turn out financially: being conservative with cash is likely to result in expensive terrain necessitating lots of card draws (and expensive last-ditch support). Obviously an internal balance, but how this is going to work out in practice is simply impossible to predict. Players are merely hopping on for the ride, I suppose. The game is not broken in any way I can think of, but so devoid of anything interesting that I won't bother to play again.

Production: In typical Adlung Spiele fashion (the Cheapass Games of Germany), this is a board game disguising itself as a card game, that could benefit much from the addition of certain key components.  Still, the art is nice to look at, though very computery.  Play: An interesting auction game.  I'll have to play it again to get a better sense of it.  (1+0+2) (1 play)

An Adlung card game depicting the railroad construction from the South African Cape to Cairo. This is a fast playing game where players are racing to be the first to convert 8 terrain cards into track. Terrain comes in five flavours and each has a different cost in &quot;track&quot; symbols to build across. Rivers are difficult, savannah is easy, etc. Players bid for their terrain from a meagre supply of cash, which can also be used to supplement track symbols at $10 per symbol. When converting terrain to track, a cash bonus on the terrain card is rebated back to the player. This is a fast playing filler, and a very good game.

The English rules in the game are poor and very confusing, but when you eventually figure it out, it&#039;s really very good. It is a nice auction game, and possibly works better with more players, but the mechanism is nicely balanced. An example of the bad rules translation is that you deal up cards to be auctioned, but the rules don&#039;t say that the highest bidder gets to *choose* which card they take, then the next highest bidder chooses and so on. This only became apparent when reading the rule about the tie-break! One of the better Adlung games and worth buying.

Played 1 time. A bit fry, but totally unlike any card game I've ever played. The theme works well enough, and it plays quite quickly. Not as complicated as the rules make it sound. Not sure whether this game is okay or pretty good. But it definitely has it's place among the better half of German games, and the rpice is tough to beat.

I've only played two player, but it was fun with a fast ending.  A good portable card game with an auction and a money management aspect.  The cards serve several functions and the whole thing is pretty smart. It feels kind of retro in that you use paper and pencil for book keeping.  Player can spend more to pick up the pace and put pressure on opponents.  My rating may go up with more players...

Considering that it's just a pack of cards (and really simple cards at that) Vom Kap bis Kairo is fairly impressive. There is more to the game than one might think. The problem is that there is hardly a way to properly assess card valuations, especially for the other players, so the blind auction is quite arbitrary with bids all over the place. Most of all, however, it is a game of timing in which you need to overcome (or ride the train of) card draws that add a sizeable dose of randomness to the proceedings.

The blind bidding mechanism either makes it or breaks it. For me clearly "breaks it" making the outcome too arbitrary. Otherwise you just make some math in this game calculating costs and odds. Uninspired and boring to me. I could't care less about a game.

RATING: 8
Fast game, small amount of strategy, but good-clean-quick-fun.  Probably only 2 or 3 general strategies that can work.  But randomness introduced by the blind bidding system means nothing quite goes to plan.  But that doesn't matter, it's still fun building railroads :)

RATING: 5
Gameplay is divided into two phases. First, the terrain acquisition phase where players simultaneously make a bid for the order of selecting one of the terrain cards on display. Second, the track building phase where players advance their locomotive by converting terrain to track to be the first to cross Africa, i.e. convert eight tracks. This phase has a slight push-your-luck feel combined with the decision to compensate the difference between available and necessary tracks with money.

A lot of play for such a small package but Vom Kap bis Kairo fails to excite. The auction via sealed bids was disappointing as it wasn't very tense. With experienced players this might change but there's not enough here to make me want to explore this game.

A surprisinly fun little game!  The rules as provided by Adlung are very inadequate - poorly constructed and difficult to follow.  I had to read multiple times before I could figure out exactly what to do, but maybe it's just me.  The graphic design is also subpar, a classic example of amateurish 3d animation.  That said, the game was a pleasant surprise - very fun!  Sure, there is a ton of luck in the track cards that you flip over, but you still have to manage your money, and the bonus tracks for rivers can make for some powerful moves.

One play.  4 player.  Combines a mechanic I love with a mechanic I hate; cards have multiple uses (victory points, resources, and money) combined with auctions, auctions, and more auctions (8 rounds of auctions).  I can't recommend the game mostly because in order to play effectively, you need quite a few extra pieces that don't come with the game (since it's, you know, a deck of cards).

Quick auction game with a train theme in that you seek to be the first player to build 8 sections of track.  Different types of terrain require a different amount of track to build.

A funny little track-building card-based train game with a really odd expansion mechanism and some convoluted play when crossing rivers. Cards have different terrains and hence differing costs to build track. Lay track and try to be the first to reach your destination. It's okay, but I can't say I was thrilled by it. I'd play it again, however.

Really interesting concept, I like how the game flows and everything, but money isnt't tight enough by a longshot -- which makes the first few turns kind of an extended setup phase, and only the 2-3 last turns are really important to winning the game.

A simple auction train game with some built in catch-up mechanisms.  For the price, this is a good game.  It's just a deck of cards with instructions (multilingual).  So far I've only played with two and we decided that the game is far too balanced for two people.  My rating may go up after I get a 3rd or 4th player on track.  UPDATE: played with 3, it's a much better game.

Vom Kap bis Kairo just keeps getting better and better.
It has the look and feel of a light filler, but it seems to have some depth that satisfies my... um... meatier urges. I just recently returned to it after a longish pause, and reading the reviews and session reports (just to catch up and refresh my memory), I came across a bunch of strategies I just have to try for myself. Brilliant!
Definitely one of Adlung's big games in small boxes.

Players bid for track terrain, then flip over the deck to travese the terrain. First player to complete 8 terrain win. The random flipping of the deck during the traversing phase adds some luck to it. We played twice, and the sense was that it seemed okay, there are a couple of decisions that have to made early (do I take the stream terrain to earn bonus tracks?). Not a bad game at all.

An Adlung-Spiele small card game that involves bidding on terrain to build trains across Africa. The game is almost more a testament to what can be accomplished in a small deck of cards than anything. In that light, it's impressive. In some others (e.g. having to keep score on a pad and paper), it's dated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
generally speaking, the mechanisms are nice - but some of the cards are so expensive to build that you might be blown off the game by just receiving it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this definitely recommendable, pleasant race-auctions-hybrid game, from two to four players have got to build a railway through eight sectors of different African landscapes: in eight successive one-bid auctions they strive for the routes that offer the biggest pecuniary reward, the easiest construction or a compromise of both. After each auction, players build their railway line sector by sector until one player can't build any longer. The first player to build all eight sectors wins.

Since we're talking about a game published by Adlung, all this plot has got to be adapted to a pack of cards. Here it's done in an elegant, stylized way: each card is a lanscape with money and materials on one side, and a finished railway sector on the other one, so that players simply keep all their cards in a line and flip them while they build the rails, consuming the corresponding materials and getting the payoff. A locomotive card "drives" over all the finished sectors.

Vom Kap bis Kairo is relaxing but not trivial to play - it's as important to build sectors as to save up enough money for the last, capital bid. On the other hand, too much to build after this last bid might mean running short of money to finish the track. The game scales perfectly; this is a particular merit since auction games that work for two players are not a common sight.

The game was engaging enough for a shortie, with groan factor in the blind bids and the luck in the draws. Good enough for a change of pace for 30 minutes or so, it’s just that the whole paper / pen / blind bidding thing is a bit of a turnoff. I find myself favouring the theory floating around ... why would you ever pay to move until the end? Which doesn't make for much intra-game interest for a race game.

Based on one play: The rules are a bit off, but once you understand them, the game is actually fun. It has a way of preventing a runaway leader by making it easier for the person trailing to catch up as older cards still count towards your ability to cross terrain. Cute and fun for a filler.

One of the most original card games I found, a nice mechanism and a beautiful idea. Unfortunately at a first game it looks to me that it is an auction game in which auction has got a very poor effect on the overall game. And the consequence is a very balanced game in which players are going very easily to reach the end all together. The win then goes to the one that draws the highest card.

Uses an auction/bluffing system similar to Footsteps - http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Footsteps.html – or commercially Quo Vadis (the one published by Invicta Games).

Interesting bidding/spending mechanics compensate for rather lousy game art (the "construction costs" card is so poorly designed it affect its function as visual orientation).

Players race to build first a railroad from Cape to Cairo.  To do so, they bid for terrain grants.  Of course, building in some land areas is easier than in others, and every time players do they receive some money, needed for the auctions but not as a winning parameter.  The cards have track values that are used to construct, applying different combinations.  The game is OK, but normally is really even, so it is very often decided for the luck of the last draws of cards.

Vom Kap bis Kairo -- Played twice; three-player and four-player.  Reading the instructions left us a bit puzzled, but within one round, the rules gelled.  It's actually quite easy to teach/learn.  

While it's ostensibly a race game, the most important element is the management of "money" for auctioning landscapes and purchasing "missing" track segments.  We used chips for bidding (hidden behind player shields), rather than pencil and paper.  The game is somewhat self-balancing, as forging ahead has some advantages, while holding back has other advantages.  Surprisingly fun.

First, I have to say that I've only played this with two players.  I found that the bidding was just downright silly.  The fact that you can't take your money with you, means that it really means nothing for the outcome of the game.  In a two player game, the blind bidding just gets retarded.  I'll bid 36, I'll bid 1.  The scale starting out with 100 means that you really don't have much to lose.  As an experiment, I tried to not move my train through most of the game, and found that the balancing mechanism was just too powerful, I easily came from the back with my counterpart having a significantly substantial lead, which is just silly in a economic racing game.   Perhaps with more players this game would have some dynamics.   With two though this offers nothing more than a basic mechanic designed as an exercise rather than a game. With two I give it a 2.

UPDATE: With three it works well.  It is a clever little economic race game.  There is certainly a considerable amount of luck with the track deferment draws, but it makes the game much more exciting.

The computer art is cold, but functional.  I'll play this with chips instead of pen and paper next time.

It's a train-themed game, but just barely -- another quick little filler game from Adlung spiele! I'm going to have to play this a few more times to make sure I've got the rules correct, but it seems to be another nice little game, even despite the blind bidding (which I usually don't like) -- because I think you need pretty much all your 100 money, so even if you don't win early auctions you'll probably make up for it later? 

--- Summary ---
Each player has a train; all are placed in a line. Cards have one of 6 terrain types (with varying costs to build track through), 0-3 track symbols (which help you build track across the terrain in front of your train), and a number (payoff when you build track across it). Each round begins with a land auction: flip 1 card per player, then each secretly bids money (start with 100). Choose terrain in descending bid order, and place the chosen track in front of your train. Then the track-building round starts: flip the top card. The bid-winner can use it's track symbols + the symbols on the card in front of the train, to help build (may also pay $10 to sub per track), or pass; if passing, the next player flips the next card and may use both (all) revealed cards. Continue till someone uses all cards and builds track: flip the card in front of their train and advance the train one space forward. If no player has their train to the end of their path of terrain tiles, repeat the track-building step. Otherwise, auction another set of terrain cards. There are special rules about the river terrain cards, too. The first player to advance their train 8 spaces (cards) wins.

This game was praised a lot when it was just released, though I never understood why. The first few auctions hardly matter, as the number of tracks on the later cards is far more important.

A very interesting bidding game who's rating will probably rise with more plays, as I can already see some interesting strategies forming.  Plays very quickly, even with AP sufferers!

RATING: N/A
A fairly typical Adlung card game, where players compete to build a railway line across Africa. Cards are turned up for bidding on, depicting terrain that you need to cross. Some are easier to cross than others, but cards also depict train and money amounts. Trains are needed to actually complete the lines, and money helps replenish your cash supply for bidding on later cards.

Interestingly, you use a community pile of cards to build your rail lines, each player turning up a new card from the deck to add to the community pool for building. This makes for some tough decisions, as you can also spend cash to make up shortfalls in trains. So, you might look at the table seeing that you have only 6 trains but need 8, but surely if you pass to the next player, he'll turn up another train and build with those 6, and you'll be back to 0. So, you spend the cash to build. But you need to manage your cash, so you'll still be able to bid on future cards.

Like many games with bidding, playing 2 player wasn't the best experience. There were many times when both cards up for bidding were similar, so bidding would be very low, since you were satisfied either way. Definitely want to play this with more.

Overall it is not too bad, but fails to be good and I am not likely to choose to play it again.

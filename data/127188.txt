OK game, I wonder what's the market target the designer as looking for this game. More players improves the gameplay but increases downtime, children and downtime don't mix like water and oil. So, is Tweeeet a game for playing with children? If it is for adults, is not too light?

The marvelous components upgrade my rating in +0.5 and I think that are the main attraction for my daughter to keep asking me to play it (but never again 6 players because of the downtime that bored her to death).

RATING: 6
I find the components really pleasing -- the bugs and worms and things are really cute.   Unfortunately, the gameplay is pretty uninspired, and this certainly feels like a kids game.   

The problem as a kids game though is that having player birds dying and getting eliminated from the game is the sort of thing that would end the 4 year old in tears, so... probably no go there.

RATING: 6
A simple game of positioning and resource management, where players move their birds on a grid, spending energy in order to find food to get more energy.  Players are split into teams, the robins and the bluethroats and may either talk to each other, tweet to each other, or just flap their wings at each other depending how far away from each other they are on the map (this is mostly a silly rule, but still fun to play!).

On a turn, a player simply moves his bird to a space with food in it, spending 1 point of energy in food he already has to get there per space that it took to get there.  Different types of food are worth varying amounts of energy, from 1 to 5.  So, the goal is to be continually amassing more energy, while blocking birds on the other team from doing the same.

As the birds fly north on the map, new tiles are added to the map, so you're never sure where the exact position of the next food will be very far in advance.  The last tile added is a row of bird nests, and the entire team must get in the same nest.  At the end, the average energy of the team is the team's final score.  Any birds that ran out of energy during the flight are dead, and score as -1 energy for their bird, which of course kills the team average as well!

Overall, a cute and simple game.  More cut-throat (and fun!) if you add more players (or play as multiple birds with 2 players).

Lovely little game of spending energy to find more energy to eventually fly back to your nest and hopefully have the most energy leftover when you get there. 1 Play.

A take-that / blocking coop which is great with 6, but severely underdeveloped for fewer players. Half baked, so although the initial idea was good. Cwali needs a bit more development oomph, it seems, this is becoming a pattern.

Given that you can make change, the decisions in the game *seemed* fairly straightforward.  There were a few points where my partner and I stopped to discuss.  Even if it has layers of complexity I'm missing, though, I'm not sure it's my kind of game.  I just didn't care.

Players are either robins, or bluethroats, birds on the wing trying to find food, and make it back to their nest.   Beautiful game, where on a players turn, the must fly through a path of unblocked hexes and land on some food.  They must pay energy for their flight, then earn the energy for the food they landed on.  The board is gradually extended by rows down, and the path behind is closed off as the birds migrate.  The final row is the nests, where birds of the same type must meet up.  Energy is totaled and averaged between the robin and bluethroat players and highest wins.  

I liked this one a lot.  Very easy to learn, but incredibly tense, nasty, fun, and if you had the full six players, downright mean.   Great fun, and stunning pieces.

A very simple, quick and, despite appearances, mean game. Probably best played with at most 4 players since with more, just having the wrong seat can mean near instant death. The only thing you can do is run around and block people (birds) which is quite entertaining for a short while but the game is too shallow and arbitrary on the whole.

Partnership racing game. Components in game look cute. Except the game parts, the game have not attracted at all. Tweeeet is somewhat boring and down time. In my opinion, beautiful game parts are not really important to attract games. For this reason, I've sold this away.

RATING: 7
A fun team game for casual gamers who don't mind that gameplay can be mean and a player potentially can be eliminated. Although elimination probably only takes place with six players. The communication rules are intendedly vague. As I don't like any party/acting elements in my games, I decided that communication is only allowed within a team when players are within six steps. Otherwise, no communication at all. The rules state that tweeting (?) is allowed.

The material wowed the female players. Tweeeet is easy to explain and a pleasant game for 30 minutes although I wouldn't pull it out with strategy gamers.

I like the brutal nature of the game. On the surface it seems like a kid's game, with the animal theme and toy-like fruit pieces. But the real fun is in the competition, blocking other little birds so that they starve to death.

Team racing game where you need to collect a lot of food to take back to your nest.  If you have a child (8 year old daughter for me), then this game is very useful for teaching math using abstract objects (bird food).  The board is variable and the game bits are very pretty.

Based on a 3P game; lacking in tension; may well be better with 5 or 6. I wonder if 2/hex might be a better cost for games with 3 players, or a tax of 1 or more food each move.

13-06-2015. Rated after 1 play. Tweeet looks.. err.. offputting. I was pressured into playing it and sadly found myself enjoying it somewhat. The game turned out to be quite good even.

In Tweeet, you play as part of a team of birds. You fly around, eating food and collecting VPs by doing that most efficiently. The final score of your team is basically the average of what you have collected if you finally find your way to the nest.. or if you have died (-1 VP and no points for collected foods).

Each turn, you fly from one location to another location that holds a food token. Each square you move, you have to pay 1 food. If you ever run out of food and cannot reach a food token your bird dies.

The game is not bad. It's just not very interesting either. I had good fun with it bantering and acting out silly, but not much game here.

RATING: 3
Played it with 6 players. 

Actually pretty good, but doesn't scale well. So 6 or nothing. As a race game it's fluid, fast and for me at least original - you fly as far as how much food you eat, and you just from food to food, collecting it and blocking other competitors. And a team game to boot (we need more of those). 

The game has one issue which people complain about, but I actually loved - the communication rules inside of the team. Players can talk to each other only if they're close to each other, otherwise they have to tweet and do pantomime. This obviously upsets some people, but I enjoyed it. You just don't have to do it seriously. And I mean what kind of deep plans you need to convey anyhow - get there or there, block that guy, that's easy to show while doing stupid bird noises. 

Only thing I would prefer is more generic playing pieces  - these are cute and original, but I like it simpler and easier to read. (ideally animeeples and fruitmeeples). I could see this becoming a much better game if developed by a bigger company and made to suit different player numbers, different tracks, easier to read artwork and so on. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A Cwali game I actually 'get' and have a chance of winning. Players play in teams as birds trying to move across hex boards with 'energy points'. Along the way, they need to pick up further points and try to block opponent birds off. The board also extends as birds fly further out. Game is over when all birds (which didn't 'die' from energy loss) land in a nest. Team with most energy points remaining wins.

Light filler with cute bits. 

Will play again as it plays quick but not compelling enough to own.

Can imagine this falling flat with two players.

Brilliant team game with robins and the bluethroats attempting to close each other out...permanently.  It is really adorable, which makes starving to death rather shocking.

Super cute gme of getting to your bird to the other side of a modular board with as much food as you can, lots of screwage and team work.

Would have been better themed as Not birds....as the movement restrictions are more akin to hedgehog racing than creatures of flight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Players control birds flying back to their nests, picking up food along the way. Birds can't fly across water, past other birds or past food, so blocking is more than just possible (a player who cannot move to another food space is out of the game).

I picked it up on the strength of recommendations that it was a downright nasty (ooh!) filler with partnerships (ah!) for a problematic player count, but the viciousness never really materialized. This comment by another user sums it up pretty well:

[q="qwertymartin"]Tweeeet felt like it had potential, but it didn't evolve into the bloodbath I was hoping for, even at a table full of cut-throat bastards.[/q]

The ability to actually block a player depends quite heavily on random tile placement so it was usually more of a low-grade annoyance than genuine peril. And I imagine that fatal blocking is more likely to result from luck than planning.

Components are adorable.

I think my rating might be slightly inflated based on one play with a group that really got in to the idea of blocking and working as a team. This worked better than expected (better than usual?) because the way we were sat - all of the blue team next to each other and then all of the red team next to each other which meant that you could co-operate to block the other team.

As it is, it's a clever little race game that works well and plays quickly, even if it has some (potential) player elimination.

I would rate it it 8+ for playing with kids/family (it's now my son's favorite game although there's not a single dinosaur in it) and 6+ when for playing with "gaming crowd". So 7.5 seems to be fair average of these two ratings, even before mentioning "cuteness factor" which deserves at least 0.5 extra.

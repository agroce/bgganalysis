Not a bad feather-weight card game at all. There's not much to it, though, and I must confess that the main thing I like about it are how attractive the playing cards are!

This game is heavy on luck, but I don't care. There's just something very elemental about it. I like not being obligated to follow suit. Another big draw is that the small hand size and easily grasped rules allow young children to play.

Intriguing trick taking game. I grew up on spades, Euchre, hearts, etc. so it was fun to try this traditional Italian card game. I played only one round, so it's a very brief sample, but this was very enjoyable. I'd play again just to learn more.

This is a great game to play on the train or on a plane.  It's fun with two players and doesn't require much room for the cards.  You only have three in your hand at one time and one pile for each person on the table/tray.  This game is quite fast, too, so you can play it many times.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is quite a light trick-taking game where you win particular cards for points but only use a 3 card hand. Nevertheless trick-taking tactics apply, and card counting will help.

I've played it 2p and 4p with partnerships.

This traditional game uses an Italian 40 card deck, of which I own a copy.

Very simple trick-taking game. Not much depth, but can be a decent time-killer.

RATING: 8
This was very fun to play with my 9 yr. old due to the small 3-card hand size. We used a "standard" deck and kept a running tally of our scores on a Cribbage board. Watching the scores swing back and forth and coming down to the wire to see who would make it to 61 first really added to the enjoyment for both of us. 

At first we incorrectly played that a 3 only outranks a 2 but still scores second-highest. This felt like an interesting twist. After realizing the error, I see no reason to use the 3 as the second-highest card, and plan to use A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6, with A-10 scoring points. 

I really like LurkingMeeple's simplified scoring idea for "Diet Cola": AT=3, KQJ=1, 9876=0, but I'd keep the 10 between the Jack and 9 to make it easier to teach and remember. 

Also appreciate his comments on Briscola Scoperta which is played with cards exposed: "Heavier analysis is ballast on a game that should fly." Enough said, that defeats the purpose for me.

RATING: 6.5
The amount of table talk was a little too much for what I am used to. The game is interesting enough; particularly the end game. I am not sure whether looking at your partner's hand in the last round is an official rule, but I didn't like that part much. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I have two (or more!) Spanish decks because I played this game (we called it Brisca) a lot with my sister and I have really fond memories of it and why on earth have I not played it in years?! I will rectify that ASAP!

Italian card games are mostly fairly light and Briscola makes a good introductory point trick game that plays well over drinks. For those that like a mental challenge, Schnapsen is much better.

First played "Calabresella" on April 24th, 2008. This 3 player game takes about an hour to play 5-6 hands. It's a pretty hard 3 player game complete instructions found here: http://www.virtualitalia.com/sports/cards/cards_calabresella.shtml It can be played with a standard deck by removing the 10,9,8's. I'd recommed giving this a game play if you need a three player game and want to give a new one a try. Warning, it's difficult to succeed with as 4 of the 5 hands we played the declarer got set.

A very simple trick taking game that still works when playing with family, but is not going to be something I recommend to gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple trick-taking game with pointless reordering of card values and pointless trump randomization. You only have three cards on hand at any time and don't have to follow suit. Seems about par for a traditional card game.

Note that many commenters are obviously rating the game based on the five-player version, which has its own BGG entry.

An easy and almost mindless way to pass some time.  I used to play with my parents and with relatives back in Italy.  Unique, I believe, in that your played cards don't have to follow suit.  The "real experience" comes by using the appropriate Briscola/Scopa cards.

RATING: 7
Casual luck-heavy fun for 2 or 3. In partnerships, I've only played a variant where all cards are dealt. (No signaling; that's crap.) I'm still trying to figure out how to read other players, given the lack of a requirement to follow suit.

This was the first trick-taking game I taught my children, except with a French pack and fewer points -- what I dub "Diet Cola": AT=3, KQJ=1, 9876=0.

[i]Double Briškula[/i] [[url=http://www.pagat.com/aceten/briscola.html#double]Pagat[/url]] draws out the guessing/bluffing tension by going around twice per trick. It's an interesting change of pace, but it gilds the lily.

[i]Briscola Scoperta[/i] is for two players with cards exposed. It's not bad, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the basic game the couple times I've tried it. Heavier analysis is ballast on a game that should fly.

RATING: 5
Based on one quick play of a single game, I like the variation on trick-taking that Briscola offers (particularly only a small subset of cards scoring points, and those not needing to be trump), but it didn't blow my skirt up. I gather it's normally played in sets of games, and benefits from having enough experience to be able to count cards and plan ahead, so I can see subsequent plays changing my rating.

You don't have to follow suit here.  It works fine.  Hard to compute too deeply when you only have 3 cards at a time.

RATING: 6
Seems like a pretty entertaining light trick-taking game. Having only three cards in hand makes the decisions easier and the game quite fluid. Pleasant, if not very deep. 

With five players, the game doesn't work too well - the lax cardplay rules make things just a tad too chaotic for me. With two, it works better.

Indifferent.

I know I'll go to hell for this, because it's the 2nd italian national "sport" after soccer (and somewhere it even steals the 1st place)...
But really, the game itself is as dumb as a wood, a trick-tacking without charme. I've never got it.

Classic old Italian card game, has a soft spot for me growing up. Great feel to it (exciting when you get decent cards) and has a good strategic element to it, the cards look awesome too once you know what they represent. Been around for ages I guess that says enough about how solid a game it is.

Quick setup. Great fun. A little luck and a lot of short-term tactics. 
This game, and its predecessor "Tute" have been favorites of both kings & commoners going back centuries. "Italian Cards" constituted such a distraction that there were laws regulating play during working hours. Haha - the Facebook of our ancestors. ;-) If you like Battle Lines or other tug-of-war or trick-taking games, you'll like Briscola/Tute. Also, try Scopa, a lighter/luckier trick taker that becomes more tactical as you scale-up the hand size past 3 cards, but is charming whether you play small or large hands.

It works very well with two, three, four (in teams) or in five (where people form short term alliances throughout the game)  If you like Scopa but want something a little more thinky, Briscola is great.

 To maximize your fun, get a traditional 40-card deck of Scopa/Briscola/Tute/Tressette cards with the traditional suits (coppa, spade, denari, bastoni). Makers of these cards with many regional artwork variations - some of which are beautiful - include: Modiano, Masenghini, Del Negro, Fournier, and Piatnik.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Briscola is an odd trick-taking game in which you don't have to follow suit, which means it's usually better to not have the lead. In the 2p game you have a 3-card hand that replenishes after each trick, so you can play the odds.

I last played this years ago, while in high school.  I was introduced to it at one of those academic things where you meet the same students from around the state time and time again.  At the time, it was so completely different from anything else I had ever played that it initially boggled my mind.  Even so, I found it quite enjoyable and had a great time playing.  This (and my introduction to Squeak at the same event) probably were foundational in developing my love for all types of games played with a traditional card deck.  [08/14/2007]

RATING: 4
With 2p this is is a very dull points based trick taking game where certain ranks are shifted for no discernible reason. There's absolutely no reason to play this game when there are many far better 2p games out there. Likely it improves significantly with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Absolutely charming, thinky, fast, exciting, not difficult; a very complete card experience. Defintely play with the variant where you must follow suit after the Brisca is drawn, makes it more thinky. 2/14/15. 

Have only played a handful of times so my rating is likely to change, right now I am somewhat interested in exploring it more. I would think holding 5 cards in your hand might be a better experience, officially I guess it's 3 which is not enuf it seems. (12.16.13)

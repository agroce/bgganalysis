An adaptation of the Bismark (AH) game system, gives player the opportunity to easily manage the hordes of planes operating in the area... It's a pity that the tactical rules, only requesting a lot of lick, are "Risiko style".

Somewhat provisional rating.  I've played through a couple of the battle sceanrios, and am finishing up my first operational sceanrio.  I like it better than Arctic Convoy and the whole series is growing on me.  Can't imagine this game will ever replace Flat Top though.

Top-notch operational game. The tactical system may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it's about the only way you're going to get through a campaign in a reasonable amount of time.

Avalanche Press. Good system but requires lots of referencing the rules and flipping between pages for combat resolution. This is probably one of the most realistic combat systems for WWII naval warfare as it tracks plane types, micro time management for flights in air, being readied on carriers or airfields and even fuel consumption of ships during course of play.  The faster a player moves his ships the more fuel is consumed.  Solid rules for ship to ship combat and airstrike combat and submarine combat which takes many variables into account - like weather, night vs day, task force spotting in order to execute the mission strike, dog fighting, CAP, ASW activity, troop transport,etc.  Cumbersome to play intially, but worthwhile to learn - especially if you are a WWII naval combat fan!

It seems natural that the Guadalcanal Campaign, which featured the fiercest naval battles in history, would be the crown jewel of the series. This is a must-have for fans of the series or of the subject matter.

Could not find people willing to play so it is up for trade.

bought the game, and then Uncommon Valor came out.  Game looks very good, but never had time to play it...

Rating after 1 tactical game. Fairly abstracted naval combat but it simulates the theme well enough, the ships do what they're supposed to. .

Bears little resemblance to historical campaign.  No constraints on deployment of ships, with ahistorical results.

In many ways the best and fastest game in the series, SOPAC is furiously quick on a claustrophobic map and makes good use of the quick-moving rules. An excellent introduction to the series.

Finally got a chance to play this at Consimworld. Went through 18 turns of the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, long enough to see a couple of combats played through. Not a bad game, but the combat and die roll system was very unsatisfying. The Combat mechanism just cries for a D10 resolution system. The D6 is too limited, sometimes creating ludicrous situations with the modifiers where one unit can't hurt another. The system has lots of potential and is an obvious labor of love, but just lacks something and it's a bit tedious to play and track unit stats and fuel.

The ultimate campaign for naval enthusiasts. US and Japan toe-to-toe for 6 months sluugging it out in the Solomons at near even odds. "Neptune's Inferno" indeed! Unopened but looking forward to this one.

I have this game and all of the other games from their Second World War at Sea series and I love all of them. They are long games -- eight to twenty hours depending on whether you actually play through the whole thing or not. I love the strategic map with the fog-of-war and the tactical battles.

Fun playing game with beautiful components.  Naval combat that centers around Guadalcanal.  The system is your typical "search-find-combat" game using a tactical map for resolving combat between those colorful and detailed ship counters that Avalanche Press fans have come to expect.  Good series.

RATING: 7.8
A game from a bygone era. A mounted map, gorgeous counters and lots of scenarios perfectly playable on a small, well defined area of the War in the Pacific. Even if carrier battles usually require some sort of "double blind" system, the SWWAS rules are built so that a kind of uncertainty remains even in solo games.

The Achille's heel of the game is the sadly endemic problem of Avalanche Press' games: the rule book is badly edited, sometimes opaque, and in need of errata.

Even with these problems, SOPAC remains an excellent introduction both to war gaming and naval war gaming, in a compact, rich and gorgeous game. If you have the patience and the money, chasing down a copy is still worth it.

Nice ship counters, lots of dice rolling.  Have'nt tried the aircraft aspect yet.  Some games could be very long.

Great OPERATIONAL-level recreation of the battle of the Southern Pacific theater. Suffers (like all Great War at Sea/Second World War at Sea games) from a "bucket-o-dice" tactical resolution system.  Some players seem to like this method - it is fast and easy and simply melds into the OPERATIONAL game - but I don't like it because it seem to give wild results that can RUIN that same operational aspect that seems so important.  Great game - but needs to have another tactical resolution system integrated.

RATING: 2
I guess I'm just not a fan of the SWWAS system for operational-level carrier battles. Tracking fuel is tedious, and the search/strike aspect lacks drama -- I feel that the choices often are easy, and you're left to the whim of the dice.

The lower-level surface battles work far better.

Love the area it takes place in---as the Japs coming down the slot and as the Allies trying to get a foothold on Guadacanal.I would like to see AP do a remake of this one (updating rules);add more scenarios and improve the ones they already have in the game.

SWWAS carries the Great War at Sea series into WWII. Air power and aircraft carriers displace dreadnoughts as the prime weapons of naval power. This game is set in the South Pacific early in the war. The same great graphics for the double size ship counters, and now for the aircraft as well. Combines a strategic game where players move their fleets around in a theater, with a tactical game used when vessels or aircraft make contact. Easy to learn rules and fun to play: similar to naval miniatures but with much simplified combat and maneuvering systems. Much simpler and less detailed search and combat system than 'Harpoon' or COA's Admiralty series. It's still possible to have a big gun duel, but more likely you'll have to contend with those pesky airplanes before you do.

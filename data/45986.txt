Was thinking about this, but sounds like the rulebook needs re-writing first and I'm kind of worried by the dubious ratings (lots of 9s and 10s from people who don't look like they are real users), most of them 'from' Poland.

RATING: 9
The rules have been significantly improved with this edition. Splitting the attacker and defender books was smart, and subtle changes serve to clear up some ambiguities present in the Polish to English translation of the previous edition. Nice to see the North American release of this.

Great game - really feels like a castle siege.  Took a bit longer than expected and was more complex than needed maybe, though that could have just been learning the rules which was near impossible.  Would love to play again though.  If it becomes easier to manage and faster, rating would certainly go up.

RATING: 7
Soll ein komplexes gutes Spiel sein. Habs selbst nicht gespielt, aber erklärt bekommen. Ganz schlimm schein aber der Einstieg zu sein, zumal die Regeln nicht eindeutig sind und alleine über 27 Seiten so im Internet zu finden sind mit erklärrenden Regelerklärungen. Ist schon etwas schwach, deshalb erst ein mal nur eine 7.

Think this is mainly a resource management game, a bit prone to analysis-paralysis (and so tends to play too long). The rulebook definetely not perfect but also not horrible (even the first version) as some suggest. Personally I enjoyed additional hints for players available at Portal's website (at least in Polish). 
In our last game we used a 3 player variant for a 2 player game and found it quite enjoyable.

From the Reviews: Darn! I had every reason to be excited and hopeful about this game. I played the computer game and I like the theme and the attacker vs. defender aspect as well. Alas! It is long (90-120 min) with weird rituals and fantasy creatures and complex rules and it only plays 2. Seems like this game falls flat on many levels, still, I would like to try it.

RATING: 6.9
I found it astonishing how much a game can put me in a serious stress situation - I mean it's not like with the Azteks where you might get beheaded when you loose.
I played the defender, and won without getting breached until end of round 8 (we stopped at that time), but it really made me fight for it.
Relatively low rating because of the stress. I'd rather get chewed out from my manager.

Initial impressions: Great 2 player wargame(?). Asymetrical powers. Great epic theme which is nicely implemented in the game. Plays in around 2-2,5 hours. There are many options for both players. I also liked that the game will not be the same every time because the invaders abilities are random at the start of the game.

RATING: 7.5
A very thematic two-player game where one player is sieging the other player's fantasy-medieval castle. Requires a bit of planning in the play of it, so needs some repeat plays before I know what I really think of it-- but like it a lot after the first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Well implemented theme.

The strategy thinking is awesome, since every new game you need to plan again what to do, because of the random cards you pick. Each sequence of cards defines different attacker moves, and consequentially, different defender moves.

Also, the theme is very immersive, and the gameplay has a good level of tactics in some points (though the game is more strategic).

Stronghold is a strange game for me that I just never made up my mind on.  I wanted to like it, but was never sure if I did.  I'd like to try Undead, and I might well re-buy the base game at some point just to satiate my curiosity.  For now, its absence from my collection won't be a big deal.

Different phase cards for the attacker gives them some interesting variations in play but the game seems needlessly complex. Game is rather bland for the defender. The board looks neat but nothing really helps sell the game's theme leaving it feeling flat; it just feels like you're moving a bunch of coloured bits around instead of storming a keep with orcs and goblins and valiant defenders holding off the invaders. Not very satisfying. Selling it turned out to be more enjoyable than playing it.

First impression: Played once as the invader with some wrong rules we corrected midway through the game. Looks like a nice game with a lot of different strategies to explore (mostly from the invader's side). Wasn't quite as good as I was expecting, but it did provoke a nice discussion afterwards.

The invader seems to be in a tight race against the clock, and the glory points distribution might be a bit off balance (it's possible for the invader to lose by breaking into the stronghold, when breaching only the following turn would end up in a victory). There's also a lot of minutiae to understand, leading to a low action to planning ratio. Mostly, however, the game seems to be interesting with lots of different possible approaches, aided by the semi-random order setup.

---------------------------

Second play: either I haven't fully understood the game yet, or things seem really tough for the invader. I remain unconvinced about this game, but I want to play more to explore the different possible strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite a fiddly game, but we very much liked it.  The amount of pieces is certainly off-putting, but this can be countered by organizing ahead of time for setup.
The rules could have been set forth more clearly, which reflected in my rating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Asymmetric games! Really cool, especially how the action point systems are so different for the invaders and the defenders. But the game balance seems quite off, and you get weird situations where the invader can't burst in now, or he'll lose! I think some of the non-VP variants would be good to try, and would probably heighten my appreciation for the game. As it is, it feels pretty stressful being the invader, because the entire pacing of the game rests on your shoulders and you can easily find yourself unable to win on like round 4.

Nagyon egyedi, nagyon összetett, rettentő sok lehetősége van mind a védőknek, mind a támadóknak (nekem néha már túl sok is, pl. a varázslatok esetében). Szerintem amit az "Erőd" témából ki lehetett hozni, azt kihozták. De egy parti alapján nem is lehet megismerni minden komponenst, mert változó, hogy egy játék során mi kerül játékba. A játék vége felé is előkerült olyan jelölő, aminek létezéséről a mi oldalunk akkor értesült:)

Tetszik a játékmenetet alapvetően meghatározó kártyák kiválasztása (újrajátszhatóságot növeli), és a két oldaluk. Ezenkívül az időegység is nagyon ötletes a játékban.
---
3 év elteltével egy újabb partira nyílt lehetőségem. Szuper ez a játék, feljebb is pontozom! Nem rövid, de annyira nem is vészes, körönként fél óra, de elég esélytelennek tűnik a 10 kör, nekünk 6 volt.

Intimidating rule book (one for each person), a lot of options, but games will be different each time due to random card draws by the attackers.  Great theme, a little abstract with the use of cubes rather than miniatures, but it works well.  The use of victory points for the winning condition seems a little out of place...you defend the stronghold or you don't, but it all depends on how long you hold out, so I suppose it works out.  It is a lot of fun regardless.

Innovative siege simulation game. Unlike everything I've seen. Perhaps Castle Panic resembles an extremely simplified version on the same theme.
The innovative theme and game genre might attract fans. I for one look only to the gameplay. There are some interesting mechanics on this game, which provide some depth, though I have the feeling they don't reach their full potential. The game does offer replayability and manoeuvering and bluff and many other tactics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Terrible rulebook, but once you play a couple of times it is a very enjoyable game. There is a definite tension created on both sides by having to do more actions than you can possibly do each turn - fun resource management game wrapped into a siege/wargame.

RATING: 9
I don't play many games that stretch on for 4 to 5 hours, yet leave me wanting to play again as soon as its over. For players who enjoy thinking their way through bluff and counter-bluff without getting bothered by frequent arithmetic, this game is excellent. It captures the story of a doomed defender holding off a never-ending horde of attackers beautifully.

I had high expectations for this one and I was not disappointed. A great, deep game in which every turn has a lot of tense. The game is well balanced if both players play good but it is much more forgiving for the invader. The defender must be more concentrated as one little mistake may easily end the game immediately. 

So far I think that the 4 player option is the best one. The dividing of the board sides between team players works out nice and natural.

Initial Impressions: Another great asymmetrical 2player game. The Invader plays a strategic game and sets the tempo. The Defender plays a tactical game and must quickly react to what the opponent is doing. Lovely components and lots of them but the overall the game is not excessively fiddly. It is, however, extremely thematic for a euro/wargame hybrid.

10 Plays: The introductory scenario was beginning to get a little stale for me so I started playing the regular game. Battering rams are fun and I have yet to try the seige engines. These next ten plays will see me mixing up my strategies in order to really test the balance of the game. I applaud the designer for the great care he took into melding theme with mechanisms so well.

IN PROGRESS NOW!! (09/07/2010) - just love the look of the board, the feel of mass minions arriving in the camps getting ready to storm the hold, the worry etched in the faces of the heroes as they try to rally their meager troops to the walls. Geez, I'm just in turn one! Oiy, the rules bite! Lots of downloads, player aids, internal notes later, I think I've got a handle on the how. Now its about implementation and learning strategy.
10/29/2010:
Ok - I've been sidetracked - only on turn 3, and the minions have just reached the walls. I've been busy with other things, so the game has languished on my plexi-board all this time - fortunately it's still out. I STILL like this game - just gotta complete it!

First Play. I tried to sit down and read the rule book on its own but really couldn't ubderstand what it was about. In the end I laid out the board and pieces but still couldn't reconcile the game content list and the set up illustration. It was only by cross referencing the rules with the board set up and dipping back into the contents I sort of cracked it.

There do appear to be bus sized holes in the rules and we had a laptop fired up to ref the game page here whenever we stumbled.

Print off the Invader's and Defender's bookets from the files section otherwise you wil be constantly fighting over the rule book

But the destination is worth the bumpy journey. This is a lovely game with various set up options that mean every game will be different. Write off the first game to sorting the rules but once yo have them taped the game flows quite nicely. So many things to do, so few moves to do them in. Very strategic with some tempered luck. A very nice game.

Did my first play and my initial impression is that the game looks intimidating but once you start playing it becomes easy to understand. However the thinking on what you want to do versus what you actually have resources to do is quite the balancing act. I lost my first game as the defender because I missed one detail and allocated too many resources and troops to an action that ultimately failed and later during that turns melee combat, my walls were breached. It will take more plays to learn the nuances of the game.


I had fun but it was a learning game so it takes longer and mistakes are made. I will revisit this 8 score after a few more games.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a great game, however I can't give it the score I like due to the amount of homework you have to do to learn the game.  The rulebook has so many typos that point to incorrect definitions and incorrect examples and lead to asking many questions. The FAQ list is very long (24ish pages)and I would say is a mandatory read. But once you get all your homework done you'll find a very enjoyable, well thought out siege game,

RATING: 7.3
There is a lot going on in this wannabe Ameritrash game which basically is just another resource management game. But amazingly enough the game seems to succeed in combining the best of two worlds. The theme really adds to the game for me. When defending the stronghold you are really feeling glorious the longer you hold out against the oncoming hordes. But in the end, you're just shoving some cubes around. Just realize this is strictly a 2 player game in my book. Playing with more seems to quicly suck the fun out of it.

A short remark about the rules. If you play the game by the published rules the game is broken. This is one of the worst set of rules I ever saw. Everything that is written down actually seems to mean something else. A new ruleset available for download is a must if this publisher wants to retain some kind of credibility.

Suffers from problems with combat resolution and the ability for invaders to make interesting assaults within the confines of very limited movement.  You spend most of the game building up to the assault rather than assaulting which seems counter to the intent.  It's hard to describe but the push to the walls is never interesting; it is neither a war of attrition or the thrill of a surprise push at a weak section.  Some experimental tweaks did not seem to fix the problem.  It's really too bad as I liked the idea a lot.  Also the power of the random Invader cards varies quite a lot which is disappointing.

I'm not a fan of eurogames but this game uses eurogame mechanics to present a pretty accurate picture of what a fantasy castle siege must be like.  Most of the time my complaints of euros is they write a game and then apply the theme. In this case the mechanics actually reflect the simulation of a castle siege. 

However, that said, this game really does need dice.  The eurogame "calculate hits so I know the result ahead of time" aspect of the game does little to reflect the friction of war.  If I designed it I'd put a d3 hit randomizer on the wall to make it more interesting, then I'd give the game a 10.

Played the first edition. I liked it, it had some great mechanics, but I had some very mixed feelings. It felt like there was a bit too much to do at times and it could be overwhelming.

This is an interesting pulse driven two player game.

I like this game but not nearly as much as many others. It also is a game I would find challenging to play anytime especially if i wanted more excitment-  It is just a bit tedious with a bit too little ability to create tension.

I think the battles are a little bit too predictable once the invader has placed his resources and his various units.

I would like a bit more of a sense of danger or to see more "risk taking" vs what to me seems like a push and pull game.  

To me it is a "grind of sorts" that leans back and forth between the invader and the defender.

The eye candy is nice--the rules are a bit jerky and there are quite a few time when you will be looking for clearer rules.

This game might raise or fall after more plays.

Quite fun for a first play of a game with a ton of bits and some finicky rules. We played 3 player where I was the defender. I was doing so well until I miscalculated one stupid thing and instantly lost the game. That was one aspect I didn't like, if you miscount one section of the wall where there's one dude who gets through, instant loss. Blech. But, it was my fault, it wasn't a chintzy die roll or anything. I just want to play again and win this time!

A Gamer's game!! Gets you into the game with no lack of thematic elements. Careful planning a must and not for the faint of heart as there is much to do and frustrations abound as your opponent thwarts your plans with counter-moves. Immersive as any game can get. Seems balanced, but will favor the Defender if players are inexperienced. The invader must have a solid strategy that he will stick to with his intitial phase card selection. Experience is needed for the invader player more than the defender, as the latter is mostly choosing tactical responses to the invader's moves. Each game is a little different as the phase cards for the invader offer various approaches to the overall strategic approach to breaching the wall and to victory. UPDATE: Must invest several games to fully appreciate the struggle, especially from the Invader side. Very tense, as time is of the essence, because Invader preparation actions offer the Defender more time to prepare, which is a neat balancing effect to make the game tight and unpredictable.
Includes the 10 Heroes expansion cards.

Nice tower defense game with time as ressource.
I really like the "build and develope" character of the game, as well as the fact that every step from the drafting at the beginning to every move you make affects the game and the possibilites the defender has.

A real brain-burner.  A puzzler.
It's a game where the attacker needs a plan right from the start, and the defender just needs to react.   Both roles are tense, although I think the defense has an edge and can afford to play slightly suboptimally.

Stronghold is great.  I mean really great.  It's hard to tell yet how replayable this one is, but so far, it seems very much so.  Ashar still isn't so keen on it, so we'll see if it sticks.  The best (and worst) thing about this game is its shaggy-dog nature.  Yes, the rules are pretty bad - not that they are so unclear, they just leave a lot of detail hazily described, if at all.  On the other hand, the play itself is quite open, while not being unbalanced.  The invader has her work cut out for her, but the asymmetrical nature of the game makes it very appealing (and addictive).  Furthermore, the openness of the rules and system gives this one a real sandbox feel - kind of like SimCity or Castles that graced my computer in the 90s.  The system works, is "balanced" as much as it needs to be, but within the system you can play, explore, and discover.  This really is a siege simulator that plays out like a worker-placement Euro.  No dice, almost no luck, just strategy and trying to gain that razor-thin edge.  With the right opponent, this is a great 2 player game.

I really wanted to like this more. After owning the game for a couple of months, reading both rulebooks, and being still unable to figure out how it was played, I watched Richard Ham's run-through and decided to finally give it a go. Two-and-a-half hours in, we had completed six turns and virtually nothing had happened. Admittedly, I was the attacker and was doing a terrible job, so maybe it was my fault things were so slow, but I had still not placed a single enemy on the walls, and I had only managed to break down one of the gates with my battering ram. We called the game for the defender to spare ourselves another two hours.

I feel the problem was our inexperience, but I don't know if the slowness of this game warrants the extravagantly long playing time. Hopefully future plays will change my mind, but I honestly don't know if I want to play again anytime soon.

Lots and lots of rules and exceptions ruin what could have been a tense and rewarding experience.  They should have made it a bit more straight forward, and with fewer "gotcha" plays.  Still, I'd try it again, maybe once you know all of the little things everyone can do, your plans can improve.  But, I'm not optimistic.

RATING: 8
Played a few times, and am fairly impressed. It's a genuine wargame which brings real eurogaming design techniques to bear, with good results. Sieges are resource-management operations, and there are lots of good eurogames that feature strong resource management engines. So it's a good fit, and it carries the theme well.

I think Stronghold is a good a fun game, but I have a couple minor complaints. Firstly, I think it develops a little too slowly. Part of that is expected, the besieger has to lay the groundwork for his assaults before unleashing them, but I think the buildup phase is a little slow and not quite interesting enough (build your siege engines, trim the decks, etc). Secondly, the combat resolution is a little sterile. Once guys are hacking away at each other on the walls, the compare strengths/lose the difference mechanic feels wrong. Better would have been something a little more attritional and/or involving some dice. Ballistas fulfill the game's need for some attrition and uncertainty, but it's not very thematic. Better to bloody both sides during the struggle on the walls, and make that struggle less deterministic.

---
I picked this up with the usual trepidation mixed with optimism for a limited-run high-Essen-buzz game, the sort of game that usually turns out to be a turkey, but from my solo game to learn the rules I'm pretty impressed. I hope the game plays out as well as it portends. Balance is always the tricky issue, of course.

It is a shame that game ends with the defending players first mistake (a miscount for example) further more there are not that many tactics to storm the castle, once you get to know all your options... it is just action reaction game. You put a cube here, I take mine and put here... This way for the attacker balistas anr/or catapults with the blood stones, are your best choice, to win the game... the fact that their effects are pure luck just makes the game random as hell... Sadly after fourth game won this way, I don't think I'll play it again.

After having this on my wishlist for over a year I was sorely disappointed.  Way too much of a euro - why can some traps or cauldrons only target creatures of the same color?  The theme is rich but doesn't quite feel like a siege.  Also, the defender should be able to resist the siege to win, not just delay their own slaughter for another turn.

RATING: 8.5
Fascinating game that plays significantly differently for both sides.  Attacker limits his options at the beginning of the game by choosing a strategy & sticking with it.  Defender has many options to tactically respond.  It's very hard to play well as the attacker, but once you get it, I imagine it would be tough to defend against you.  Stuck in my mind.

Sadly this turned out not to be the "epic" game I was hoping for. Terribly written rules, thin counters, unimaginative wooden pieces (both sides use the same colours) and the board while a great piece of art, is simply too "busy" imo, when you consider how long you'll be staring at it. Interesting mechanics, but the hype was that the player would feel part of the "story". Didn't work for me, I just felt I was pushing little blocks around and counting numbers, not participating in a life or death seige. Play moves quickly once you mange to interpret the rules. Certainly not an overly complex game, though there are a lot of decisions to be made, but the whole thing just seems too dry overall and lacking in atmosphere. Disappointing.

Terrible rules but use the FAQs and prepare yourself for some page-flipping during your first games. Once you're past that the game flows really smoothly and the smart phase system reduces downtime. A beuatiful marriage of Euro and war mechanics and great variablilty thanks to the phase cards. Based on three games it seems the defender has an advantage  but the attacker's mission is much more complex so I expect that to change.

RATING: 7
An interesting "beat the rush" kind of game.  I thought the mechanics worked fairly well, with the Invader using resources and troops to mass a fighting force and the Defender getting hourglasses in proportion to the amount of resources the Invader uses.  It seems that the game is biased in favor of the Defender; the Invader really needs to get a breach on turn 7 or 8 to have a real shot at winning.  With that being said, there are still quite a few options available to the Invader to pull this off; e.g. goblin archers can be used to try to wear down the enemy marksmen; saboteurs can attack the barracks, slowing down training.  I'd play this again.

2 Player Game.

At first when I read the rules, it seems bland and dry. Sure it simulates a complex game of siege, but it seems so generic. After reading new rules with little thematic background, it improves a little. But when I played it, it feels so good. When we are familiar with all of the actions there, the game will play fast, and it is a good game for 2 player. 

I consider this a lot with War of the Ring. After some thinking, I think war of the ring suffers from long setup, although it's comparable with the epicness. But for 2 player game, I think this is better compactness.

There's a serious balance issue in the base game.

Components: E
xcellent artwork, but at the same time not always functional. The board & counters look great, but it's sometimes hard to get the whole picture.

Theme: 
I'm not into the fantasy-themed games, but must admit it's not too heavy in this game. Sure, the invaders are orcs and trolls, but can easily be thought of as humans. Spells have a minor impact - all in all, I can live with the theme.

Gameplay: 
The rulebook excels in vagueness and errors. However after 1 game and with the FAQ closeby it turns out to be playable game. Still some gamey things annoy me. Why can't traps be taken care of? Cauldrons seem to easily survive when the walls on which they are stationed are cleared. At first it seems impossible for the invader to win, but after a few games some strategies are developed. A positive note: I like the way the siege-works are handled. Also the hourglass-system is very good. 

Final verdict: good game, but not the perfect playable simulation of a siege. However, very tense to play - and that's what matters in the end.

Stronghold has a lot of depth.  The theme is very good.  And it represents a lot of things that make good logical sense.  With that said, we played with the wrong movement rules & catapult rules (removing missed).  So...I need another play before I can rate the game.  But I am encouraged by what I have seen so far.
The movement rule we missed was that a minor move lets you move more than 5 total cubes:

Even though I have some serious complaints about this game, I cannot rate is lower than a six.

- It's way too long.
- The scenario varies little from play to play.
- Winning as the city's defenders generally just means dying gloriously enough. Actually saving the city is all but impossible.
- The endgame is sometimes basically broken. The defenders can (and often should) try to win by purposely allowing the city walls to be breached (as long as they make sure the breach only occurs in one location, without any severe overkill).
- Even though the game lasts 10 rounds, it's virtually impossible for the invader to win the the last couple of rounds unless the defender has done several dishonorable acts and used his bonus troops (honor guard). In those sorts of games, the last 2-4 rounds are played with a foregone conclusion.

Even given all of that, the game does have a lot of fun elements and unique gameplay, not to mention a certain charm. I may play it once more before trading it.

Stronghold is a two player conflict game that attempts to simulate the siege of a stronghold. For the most part it succeeds at being tense and engaging, immersing the players in the battle and the decisions needed to win. Despite my generally enthusiastic response to the game, I do have two concerns. 

The first concern is that the game appears to be a bit biased towards the defender. I have not played the game enough to be able to say definitively if this is the case, but if it does end up being true, the issue is easy to solve by giving the attacker another victory point or two to start the game with. 

The second concern is that the game might be too tense for the defender. Both of my opponents so far have found the defender position in the game to be tense enough that they are not especially interested in playing the game again. This, as you might imagine, is problematic because these two opponents are the people I usually play two player games with. 

I ultimately traded it away due to my lack of ability to find a regular Stronghold opponent.

RATING: 5
An interesting game, but where's the fun? As I discovered how all the interesting sub-systems worked I had very much hope. But even the first play saw a lot of the shine wear off, which is never a good sign. 

It's a war-themed game, but at heart it's about building an engine and scoring payoffs. The big problem is action-point basis and perfect information. It gets into a public calculation game instead of a guts-based game of estimation and combat.

A simple game with MANY MANY options. Took us ages to go through the rules (including the downloaded better rules) and then trying to play - we found there are a few tactics that would work when played again.

SOLD IT!

The idea can not be beat. The fact that it includes almost any kind of castle siege weapon you can think of is also amazing. The time management was another great addition here. The gameplay just fell a bit flat for me and found that the idea of playing the game was appealing than playing it.

I suppose, with this very game I have found my holy grail of boardgames for me!!! 
(Of course, first you have to struggle with the rules, but also Parzival hadn 't found the grail right from the start.)
After you got it - it is pure fun, excitement and suspense from the begin till the end!!! At the same time a story is told, you have high interaction and just a little bit of luck. You really experience an epic siege!!! 
Great design!!!

Good theme and the overall mechanics are clean and innovative.  My main problems with the game are: 1) the rule books is one of the worst I've seen -- plan on plenty of time of utter frustration if you don't have plenty of rewrites and player aids.  2) The end is anticlimatic.  Why so much stuff if the game ends with a single breach?  The "chronicle" or "glory" fix doesn't feel very satisfying.  The bad guys still won...

neat game on scope and challenge, a bit dry trying to imagine cubes as ravaging fantasy creatures and stalwart defenders...artwork and layout are stunning and surpass the weakness of the choice of cubes.

the rulebook as commented by so many people is a mess to plow through, thankfully after a bit the gameplay surpasses the rules, but it is a chore.

Fixed by the valley edition!

Absolute worst rulebook ever. If you plan on playing this game, be prepared to browse BGGs forums a lot,sorting out the countless errors and contradictions in this manual.

Other than that (and if you can look over the very simple wooden tiles which surely everyone would love to replace with some nice looking miniatures... we're playing a game of conquering castles after all!) it's a very good game with good amounts of depth and strategy. Also the fact that you can metagame a lot when playing Stronghold might appeal to a lot of gamers.


Little hint on the side: BattleLore's miniatures work well with Stronghold.

Nice castle siege game unfortunately the victory points system just doesn't seem to work as after a few turns the attacker loses victory points which the defender gains which can mean even if they do break the defenses they can still lose on victory points. 

We just play to a certain number of rounds if attacker breaches the walls they win if not defender wins.

Nagyon szép, rengeteg tartozékkal rendelkező játék. A mechanizmus teljesen realisztiusan kidolgozott.

The game has some interesting decisions and is quite thematic. But this also leads to one of the problems I have with the game:
- The scoring seems clever on the paper but in reality we always encounter a situation like 'when the attackers conquer the stronghold this ound they will lose. When they wait a round they can break throug at different parts of the wall at once and trigger some other victory points and the will win.' So suddenly the defenders try to make it easy for the attackers and the attackers try to hold back...
That would perhaps be OK in a themeless game but in this game I hate it.

This is a Eurogame with the ultimate Ameritrash theme, but almost zero luck elements. A great theme for a chesslike brain burning experience. It would have been better without all the wooden cubes, but the gorgeous board and immersive theme make up for the lack of chrome. There are an incredible amount of moving parts in the game, making me wonder at the genius of the designer and his ability to balance it all out. This is not a casual game to play. The first game is only good for learning.

Stronghold met my expectations nicely. Extremely well-working thematically and a good use of Euro mechanics to make the thing run. I love how different each side plays out. The time system works great and the way the siege engines get better accuracy as the turns go on is a wonderful addition. Each decision feels crucial. With all those wonderful things, the game definitely gets bogged down by a somewhat clunky points system (that has some rather bloated bonus point systems attached to it). The rule book has to be referenced every few minutes during the first few rounds, and even by the end of the game we didn't find ourselves slowing down too much in the rules look-up department. This would be a hard game to get even mid-level players into - you have to be a committed gamer to stand the pace of a first game of this. Also, the rulebook really needed clearer examples and a FAQ to clear up any ambiguities. All of this stuff beside, Stronghold is a solid game for its balance of theme and mechanics.

It's hard to rate this game. There are so many things to do, so many things your opponent can do that in the first game IMO it's much easier to be an invader - you don't have to carefully watch what's your opponent doing - you just throw hordes into the walls and slowly build your machines.

Now, it's a bit too fiddly. You do a lot of things just to push some cubes this way or that way... need to play more.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games and I am so glad that I got one of the last few copys before they sold out. I held off for a while due to all the problems with the rules, but the new rule book is a huge help and when Valley Games does the reprint. They will be rewriting the rule book once again. I know it looks bad with all the rules questions and all, but it's really not as bad as it seems once you get the hang of things and let me tell you. It is DEFINITELY worth it.

This is an AMAZING game that is very tense to the end and a ton of fun to play. I am amazed by all the thought that must of went into this game. The components are well made and look great and the game board is stunning. Yes miniatures would of been cool, but the little wooden cubes aren't all that bad and still look good in my opinion. 

Did I mention this game is tense? The theme is excellent and it really gives you the feeling of defending/invading the castle. There is a slight unbalance of the game in favor of the defender, which I feel could be better balanced with some house rules for the barbican. Hopefully this will be looked at in the new rules rewrite, but it's not that bad and hasn't stop us from wanting to play this game over and over and over again.

I am really hoping for some mini expansions for this game, as it is just begging for them and might also help to balance things out a bit more. If you've been on the fence about this game like I was. I would highly recommend this game to gamers who are looking for an all out tense battle till the end.

Super fun siege game with interesting decisions for both attacker and defender.  I think it gets a little pointless after round 6 or 7 if the attacker has not breached by then due to the Glory Point system, but I hear the latest version corrects that by eliminating Glory Points.  I don't mind the G.P. though, just know that it's almost impossible to win after round 7.  Looking forward to playing the new version soon to see how things are streamlined and if anything is actually improved besides production quality (which was already astonishing in the 2009 version).

Best 2-player game in my collection!  Never tried, nor do I have interest in playing with 4, and only mild interest with 3 for a teammate as attacker.

I really liked the different options available to each side. With the variable set up in the advanced rules, this would be even better. I also liked the great tension created by the back-and-forth aspect of actions. "Do I spend time here to increase my attack, or screw my opponent by not giving him enough time to react?" I made some crucial newbie errors in the beginning that I would love a chance to correct, but I'm also excited to try it from the defender's perspective.

There's a lot of criticism of the rulebook, which I can understand, but I didn't find it that bad. There are also plenty of player aids as well as the rules from the new edition available here. I think the main problem is just that there are so many options that it can feel a little top-heavy when first learning.

My biggest problem with the game was not the rules, but the board. I think the artwork is gorgeous, but the colors are too bright and distracting. The bits get lost in the art. I think the game would be vastly improved if the artwork on the board were in simple black & white except for the action areas in the castle. If I had the skills, I would create a B&W board of my own.

Simple to understand. Decent Replayability, but shallow. It's always the same thing each game, whether you go left or right, or both or whatever. After a few games, you have seen all there is to see about this game.

The game is really a two player game... like Axis & Allies or other similar ones, I don't see what's the interest of playing with more than two.

Good to play once per year, I wouldn't play it more often.

I wouldn't buy it and would trade it away if I had it. It's too shallow for me.

The Fantasy theme, beautiful board art and Euro mechanics are very appealing to me, and the game excels at simulating a siege. The trade-off is that it's quite complex, and having two rulebooks, one for each side of the battle, was not a great idea. I have only played it once and would like to play it more, but the effort required to (re)learn and teach the game makes that very unlikely to happen. Also, I must admit that using wooden cubes to represent units turns me off a little, even if plastic miniatures would be impractical.

A fun, solid, "euro-style" wargame.  The cards provide some randomness, but the game is actually VERY much a resource management game with strong worker placement, mild bluffing and "dudes on a map" elements.  It is fairly complex for a euro-style game and wargamers tackling these rules will find it equally complex because (despite being a combat oriented game) the mechanics have more in common with Stone Age or Two de Mayo than Squad Leader or Command & Colors.  Overall I think it succeeds magnificently in being a heavy two player euro game representing a direct conflict.  There is a ton of replay value since there are numerous strategies for both sides and each side probably plays totally differently.  I really enjoyed it, but do not think I will purchase it because it is not my type of game.  I'd like to see a scaled down, lighter variant or remake that would play more players.  I think if such a game could play in 90 minutes with a 15 minute rules explanation, they would have a huge hit.  As it is, this is an excellent game, but combines several odd niches which will hinder its rise up BGG's ratings. 

UPDATE:  Played this again today.  I stand by my previous comments, but actually I like the game even less than I did before.  Playing as the defender, the game resembles something like stone age- a very static and reactionary worker placement game.  Overall it is not very interesting from the defender's point of view. I had MUCH more fun playing as the invader, the choices and resource management was far more interesting.  As the defender most of the choices were pretty obvious and to be honest most of my turns played themselves more or less based on my opponent's maneuvers.

Haven't played yet but looks like an interesting euro game with a siege theme. I can see where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from, but it's easy to agree with the positives as well. Really boils down to the question of whether or not one likes the play style of it.

Can't wait to try it.

A fairly unique example of a wargame/eurogame hybrid about siege warfare, presumably inspired by the siege of Minas Tirith in The Lord of the Rings. It's well done, but oddly it could be subtly improved by using miniatures in place of wooden blocks and having a little more randomness in the fighting on the walls. (I know, those are the opposite of most eurogamers' expectations, but there you go.) My only concern is how much the game is going to vary from playing to playing, especially for the defender. I really want to see a good choice of expansion castles (along the lines of Age of Steam/Steam maps) before I think about investing in this, but I'm looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 7
Good game: gets one immersed in the siege sensation either as the invader or the defender. Once you get to play it it's easily accesible. The euro components are very functional an add intuitiveness. The learning curve for the invader is very steep in the 2 players game, really unforgiving, and I suspect there may be some balance issues. The rulebook (in English, at least) is a real mess and should be reworked thoroughly: although there are omissions that can be compensated by a rational deduction, there are some others that are unforgivable, like the possibility of the goblins attacking the towers or what the hell does the defender do with the wall components received every turn (place them, but no indication as to how).

Spent many hours with this at BGG Con 09, helping punch it out and identify the parts and then deciphering the rulebook.  We felt like the effort was going to pay off, and definitely weren't disappointed once we finally got started.

Plays quickly, smoothly (after beating the rules into submission), and adapts well for three players.  Can't wait to play again! *update: played twice more at BGG Con '10 and loved it even more.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

This game reminds me a lot of all the great Tower Defense video games out there, like Pixeljunk Monsters and Dungeon Defenders. Not to say they are identical in design, but as the Trolls, Orcs and Goblins are on your walls and trying to bash down your front door with a battering ram and demonic spells, I can't help but channel the same desperate need to keep them from breaching my defenses! 

It`s impressive how the two-sides of the same game play asymmetrically in ways that almost make them feel like different games. The attacker is very strategical, laying out bluffs and long term plans, while the defender is very tactical, using the given time to strengthen defenses and train troops. Both sides are a blast to play and with the variety of siege weapons in each game, no two matches are the same!

It can be hard to get Yuki to play [i]"Stronghold"[/i] as he feels there is a huge amount of downtime. I don`t personally feel it  because my brain is always on fire with the strategic possibilities. But it`s true that towards the end of the game when I`m calculating the strength values of every wall section, that he tends to get up and walk away from the table for 10 minutes or so. Especially if I`m on the loosing side and I don`t want to give up on my calculations and admit it. This is actually the only game in our collection where I spend more time thinking than Yuki.

[b]Expansion Review:[/b] 

It`s a [i]MUST[/i] buy if you`re a fan of the base game. It changes all of the variables present and even adds a few more without changing the basic game-play and rules. It literally feels like a different game and I will play with and without the expansion in equal measure as they are both very different, incredibly enjoyable experiences. 

A [i]BIG[/i] personal [i]THANK-YOU[/i] to Ignacy for sending one of his remaining Expansion copies from Portal Publishing. It was signed and with a awesome little sketch from the master himself. (^_^)

[b]Pros:[/b] 

- Very high level of strategy with only minimal randomness from blind cube draws and when firing siege weapons.
- The most EPIC game I have ever played in scope and through the feelings in imbues. 
- The ultimate fantasy experience that is tense right to the very end. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- It`s VERY heavy and takes forever to memorize all of the small details as you drag your companion through your first game.
- Downtime during the last several turns can get more and more drawn-out.

[b]2015 Rating:[/b] 10 [b]Rank:[/b] 1 [b]Plays:[/b] 0 - Noone is willing to play with me. So it got 0 plays this year. I hope to change that in 2016 or I might have to reduce my personal rating of this fantastic game....

There is something intimidating about this design and its rulebook.  But it turns out to be well worth the work.  It blends the most challenging elements of a good wargame with the best elements of choice and dilemma from European design.  His work on asymetry is a fantastic success.  It is clear that the beseiging army will have the steeper learning curve, but I am confident that there is a solution to their strategic riddle in the game.  The Defender faces the more familiar tactical problem of too many holes and too few plugs.  The game seems to hang on an interesting knife's edge.  Some have dismissed the game as a Euro, but I think the wargaming commmunity should find a lot to love here.

I played only once, using pre-production prototype (close to production version). The game offers lots of hard decisions for both sides. Many ways to attack and to defend, room for clever tactical moves. The gameplay is tense. The first games seem to give attacker some advantage, but this may just be true for beginners, I bellieve that it evens out with experience. I see some similarity between Stronghold and Twilight Struggle - similar tension and they both are deep games. And last for a few hours as well.

I've played a PC game called Stronghold since it was first released many moons ago.  This is the closest analogue interpretation to that game I've ever seen.  Might be nice to play but I'm still not sure I like the fact that only one player is defender and the other is attacker.

RATING: 4
Very provisional rating based on only one play as a defender in a 4-player game.

As a defender, there didn't seem much strategy other than count up what's coming and then make the necessary adjustments to limit the damage.  The one major decision of the game, which occured after 4 hours, and at which we failed to spot the correct solution until afterwards, was whether to allow the attackers a single breach of the wall thus bringing about the end of the game and giving the defenders a one VP victory.

Still, it's a great looking game - but one I won't be rushing to play again

Initial Rating: 4.0

What a disappointment!, I had great hopes for this game as I usually like Ignacy Trzewiczek games. Stronghold is just broken, the invader cannot win. I knew the game was unbalanced in favor of the defender, but this is ridiculous. I only played with the initial setup, but still it seems impossible for the invader to win, no matter which cards he has. 

The components, game board and graphic art is great, however, I also was disappointed that the game is decided by Glory Points, I thought that the invaders won if they breached the castle. The glory points, seem a lot less thematic and they force the invader to successfully breach the walls by turn 6, otherwise the Defender will win. The game is a lot more Euro than I thought (managing resources), don’t get me wrong,  I love Euro games, it`s only that I was expecting a siege and I don’t feel the theme within the game. I would love to have minis instead of cubes.

For now I´m very glad I sold my copy of the game BUT there is a caveat. As the game was so hard to get to the table, I read the rules over a month ago so it is possibly (likely) that I made a mistake. I hope so, because this game had such potential. It is currently 3:00 A.M in the morning, but I cannot sleep without checking the rules again.

YES! There was a big mistake in the way the invader moves his troops. I only moved 5 troops or 7 troops total, so the advantage for the defender was overwhelming. I need to play this again, I hope I can do it today. 

Stronghold seems like a neat game, I again have high hopes for it. The hourglass system is pretty cool too. As soon as I play it again, I will re comment and re rate.

After another play, at last I got some fun from the game. The defender was stressed for most of the game and that is great, some theme after all :D. Still the game has some big issues, if the defender throws the game in the 6th turn, allowing the invader to breach early (making a lousy defense) and only one wall, he will win due to the glory points. That makes no sense at all, it allows for an anti-thematic win and that decreases my fun with the game a lot!

After reviewing my math, the attacking player have to successfully breach in turn 7th at the latest to win, he has to breach in at least 3 walls and with overwhelming advantage, otherwise the defender will win.

It is an ok game, I was hoping for a great game. I’m still glad that I sold my copy.

Love this game. Am happy to play with coloured cubes for a change. That way you can concentrate on the strategy side of the game and not get distracted by knocking over minis. Seems complex at first but after 30 mins of play you realise that the rules allow you to play in a logical manner and allow flexability in your plans. Plays just as well as a defender or attacker. though the box says 2 - 4 players its realy better with just 2.

[b]Disastrous Implementation of Theme[/b]

Stronghold hints at some amazing possibilities but I sadly I think it falls flat on its face. Superficially there are tons of options and the game even includes a mechanism that gives you a subset of those options each session, but in short order it's just a tit-for-tat game of offensive/defensive number crunching. Progress is incredibly slow, and actually breaking through seems equally anticlimactic. There's not even a sense of attrition, just a sense of stagnation. The move-countermove aspect of it seems far too straightforward. Here's a rousing turn of Stronghold for you to sink your teeth into:

Invader: Looks like my strength is 20 at this particular wall.
Defender: Well, if I don't respond to that, I'll lose the game. Hmm... (moves some pieces around) OK, now my strength is also 20.
Invader: I'll just place this secret order that could completely overrun the wall here.
Defender: Well, I still don't want to lose the game. Gee, this option lets me cancel that order completely.
Invader: Ah-ha, I have assembled overwhelming strength at this wall, I have you now!
Defender: Hmmmm, I think I'll declare a temporary armistice at that section of the wall.
Invader: Punches himself in the face.

The integration of theme in this game is just pathetic. Cauldrons actually contain race-specific boiling oil and can never be moved. You can actually "upgrade" goblins into orcs or orcs into trolls, which you'll be shocked to hear are nothing more than strength values to be summed up and funneled around.

I like the strategy of the game and the mechanic by which everything the Invader player does confers hourglasses on the defender.  However, I think the game awards too much bonus glory to the defender for steadfastness and the Cathedral options are a bit too powerful for shutting everything down, which makes it favor the defender more than I would like.  Also, I have no idea how you would ever get away with using the battering ram to effect a breach unless you got the other player blind drunk AND cheated.

The two rulebooks didn't work for me - what worked much better was sitting down and talking through the mechanics of a turn before we played.  I think the game would have benefited from a complete sample turn (set around turn 3 or 4 of the game) so players could see all the mechanics in action.  Once we had the mechanics down, the game moved at a pretty decent clip - on our last outing, we got through 6 turns to a resolution in maybe 2 hours of play.  That's a more than reasonable length to me for a game with this many moving parts.

I see why the designer went with cubes, but I confess some of the visual appeal of the fantasy setting is lost when goblins, orcs and trolls are reduced to different colors of blocks of wood.  This is a case where counters might have delivered a visual oomph which was more to my taste.  The rest of the presentation of the Valley edition is top notch and I have no complaints there.

RATING: 4
Worst rules in a long time! The high rank of this game clearly shows BGG's bias for complexity. A four-hour long resource management fantasy wargame is a niche product. Just not my niche. Add to this uneven sides with the defender side being mostly reactive and the need for repeated plays to get the potential out of this game and I pass on this for good. To be fair, I can understand why people rate this very high. It really feels like a siege, it's a unique innovative design and the components are great.

RATING: 7
A good tower defense game, but I feel it would have been better as a Ameritrash dice-fest than the Euro game it is. I like resource management games a lot, but a resource management tower defense game just seems like a bad idea. It's definitely too dry for its theme. And this game boasts some analysis paralysis problems. Lastly, the rulebook is poorly written.

Provisional 7 based on one play only. A good evocation of the theme, and a game I'd be willing to try again, but I'm not sure whether I'll grow to like it more or less with repeated plays, as the timing limits on Invader strategy seem a bit much (given the well-argued position in the strategy threads that the Invader must, realistically, win by turn 6 or 7.

RATING: 6.5

Process-heavy mechanics, with real curvature to the narrative - starts out a little slow as the attacker ramps up his assault.  In that sense it feels almost like a classic engine-building Euro.  After a couple trips through the sequence of play the intuition settles in and things speed up.  It's a little rough on the attacker in early play, as the onus is on him to figure out what's going on while the defender can simply observe and react.  We will return to it but it is by no means a light game and demands a full evening.

RATING: 7
A heavy-ish wargame (with wooden cubes) where 2 players are attempting to attack and defend a castle respectively. In truth, it probably isn't as complicated as it reads in the rulebook, but it is pretty tricky and hard to absorb on first playing. Further playings may alter my ratings.

Love it! You've got to take your time for it, even with two, but it's all worth it! Changed parts, and both defender and invader are fun to play. Invading gives you a mighty feeling :) Winnings: 3 - 0 for the defender (the invader breached heavily last play, but to late to get enough points)

RATING: 7.5
This is a very interesting game and unlike any other I have ever played.  The game board is beautiful.  Many have criticized the rules and even the designer admitted to abhorring the game because of the need to continually explain the rules.  There is definitely a distinct order of play that must be learned and can greatly affect outcomes but once you learn them the game flows pretty smoothly.  I love the theme.  I can just picture these hordes of goblins, orcs, and trolls storming this poorly defensed castle and the heroic men behind the walls fighting their last fight knowing that it is only a matter of time before the walls are breached, yet they fight on.  So one question I have, is how amazing would this game be if the wooden cubes were replaced with plastic minis?!?!  That would be worth every penny.  I do have one major criticism.  They game seems to be very weighted towards the defense.  Yes, the invaders will eventually breach the walls but they have to do it quickly before losing too many victory points.  The barbican is almost a lost cause for the invaders.  By the time they build and ram and destroy the gates it is too late to win (as long as the defender puts 4 archers in the castle who constantly pick off 4 points worth of invaders every turn and are completely immune to invader attack).  I've found that as the defender if you upgrade your units as quickly as possible then it is hard to breach a wall section in time.  I have played the defender more than I have played the attacker and I usually win most games I play so next time I will take the attacker and see if I can destroy my preconceptions about balance.  See my comment on the Heroes expansion as well (not necessary).

Average worker placement strategy game. The concept of sieging a stronghold is thrilling, both as invader and defender. The game has good mechanisms and many good ideas (e.g. I like the invader machine decks and how the misses get discarded), but is lacking "something". The defender looks overpowered (might be due to a steep learning curve for the invader, but it gets boring for the defender, as his actions are pretty obvious). The victory conditions are strange (from round 8 [of 10] onwards you can - as defender - decide to allow the stronghold to be breached and still win the game because you have much more glory points than the invader). Overall a rather disappointing and frustrating experience. **** The rule book is very poor with too much ambiguity and leaving too much room for rule discussions. **** Rating based on two two-player sessions (once as invader and once as defender).

Big thing with this is: works well with 2 players.  Good 2 players euro wargames (and games at large actually) are rather rare, so this puts this game on the map.  Pretty hardcore wargame with many euro elements, often unforgiving and somewhat fluky despite absence of dices (dual hit from bloodstone catapult and balista cards can often cause a breach and end the game).  Rules are horribly long, unclear, confused and lack polishing (translation is sub par and the original weren't stellar to start with).  Even the FAQ is amateurish at best.  Lots of potential, but dense and sometimes fastidious.

RATING: 2
It's a brain burner. It's a very complex game because there are tons of details and exception that can easily be forgotten. The lack of randomness makes everything possible to predict which makes the amount of calculation explode exponentially. The game is also very long so it progress very slowly.

[b]About the components[/b]: The board is nice indeed, it's a bit confusing, but once you understand the symbols, you know what goes where. My first complain of the board is that some shapes are too small. For example, the card rectangle is much more smaller than the actual card size. Why can you not match the card size with the rectangle size.

There is also a lot of wooden components. There is 5 different shape of pieces which comes into different colors. There is a total of 17 types of pieces which most of them has unique ways to be used. This is not very convenient to play with. Finally, the invader use 6mm cubes, which are really small. 8mm cubes would have been much better. I know that there is 200 of them, but still, they are very hard to manipulate.

[b]About the game play[/b] There is a few interesting mechanics that makes this game unique since there is not that many siege games out there. The hourglass mechanic is interesting, the more time the invader takes to do his stuff, the more time he gives to the defender.

The victory conditions are weird, you could actually have your castle breached and win the game. Maybe it could be explained by the fact that reinforcements are on the way. But one thing for sure, you are almost sure the the castle is going to be breached every game. I like the special achievements that can make you earn more VP.

I agree that I screw up the movement rules in the first few turns, but units progress very slowly on the board. Sometimes, you ask yourself how it is possible to bring so many people on the wall without getting killed. Second, you cannot only bring units on the wall, because you are going to get killed. You must generally have a good majority before moving on the wall to have a chance to survive, which gives a lot of time to enemy marksmen to kill units waiting for attacking.

The game is also like a big rock-paper-scissor game where there are more 20 elements that can influence the relation ship. In understand the idea of having special abilities and giving the defender abilities to counter them, but the RPS relationships just makes it very complex which multiplies the calculation to predict if you are going to win or not.

The invader also has a series of cards that limits  which ability he could use. Why can he not use everything. I mean the idea of some special abilities is to counter the strategy of the opponent. The defender has access to all abilities, so he can counter any offensive strategy, but the attacker has a fixed strategy and cannot counter the defender. So if the strategic options given to invader does not work, well your are screwed.

I think the goal was to give some replay values and prevent the players from doing always the same thing in every game. But I really don't like it, they should have blocked less options, or simply make some options more expensive. Else have different races of attackers with different strategic option.

Speaking of replay value, besides the permutation of the stuff available for purchase, I don't think there is that much replay value. The castle is always the same. Why could they not use a simple modular board to allow some permutations and even make expansions give new board tiles. This way, players would have been able to try different castle layout.

[b]The Rulebook[/b]: The rules are split in 2 books so that each player has it's own book which is not a bad idea. Many people complains that the rules are very badly written even the 2 editions of them. I agree that there is a few rules that are badly explained, but in general the rules are OK if you remember everything, read all the examples and do not skip any section.

The real problem is that this game has so many exceptions and details that it could create game situations that has not been anticipated. But I think that the biggest problem is that some game elements are often misinterpreted which creates a lot of unexplained situation that the designer could not have possibly planned ahead.

For example, on BGG a player was wondering if a wall section was actually 1 stack of stone piece or if it included both stacks. It's a minor details that changes the game completely if wrongly interpreted.

Just for fun, I have compared the number of post on the "Rules" forum of BGG and compared it with another very complex game (if not more) Starcraft. Starcraft rule book has 48 pages, the game was released in 2007 and there is 33 pages of post (+- 330 post) for an average of 82.5 post per year.

Now stronghold has a combined nb of page of 35 (with some pages in doubles) the game was released in 2009 and there is 36 pages of post (+- 360 post) for an average of 180 post per year.

Not only the average but the total number of rule post exceed the nb of post for starcraft which are both brain burning game. That proves just 1 thing, not only the game is complex, it's also really not clear.

As for the playing time, the 2 hours on the box is completely unrealistic. 3 or 4 hours looks more like it. I played 4 turns as a solitaire game and it took 4 hours, 1 hour per turn. If you cut the time but half (I am very optimistic), the game would take at least 30 min per turn (so max 5 hours).

Another thing about the play time, you only have 10 turns. It takes a huge amount of time to actually do something in this game. It can take in average up to 3 turns to move people on a wall. There is even an achievement for occupying all 7 walls. Just for fun, I tried to do it without any oppositions with optimal movement.

It takes a minimum of 4 actions (max 2 per turn) to be able to move 1 unit on each wall. So it takes 1/5 of the game time if you have absolutely no opposition. Now considering that during the real game, the defender is going to shoot at you and you need to put a relatively strong force on a wall to simply survive, I really doubt it's possible to unlock the achievement when you attack 7 different walls at the same time.

So for those who likes brain burning games, little randomness, very small pieces, lot of small actions and movements with little impact on the game and games that takes lot of time to play, this might be the game for you. Everybody else, stay away.

[b]Other Stupid Facts[/b]: The blood stone spells not only cost 2 goblin to cast, but it is also not guaranteed to work because you need to draw a hit card. While other spells are cheaper and are always effective.

RATING: 8
Rating after 2 plays: Stronghold is an excellent game and plays much like a Euro-Wargame, with mechanics matching the theme. It seems to require an experienced attacker in order to win as an attacker, since you do not necessarily win the game as the attacker if you manage to break into the castle: Winning is all about Glory (i.e. Victory Points). The game has not much luck involved and requires the attacker to plan ahead a lot. 
Stronghold provides a lot of strategy, VERY asymmetric gameplay depending on whether you play the attacker or the defender of the stronghold.

.... and, YES, the rules are ambiguous and in parts incomprehensible. But the FAQs help a lot!

Very interesting Euro-inspired wargame that manages to make siege warfare a tense and engaging struggle.  I like the different challenges presented to invader and defender and am glad to see that there is some variety in terms of rituals, siege machines etc. to prevent the game from growing stale quickly.

I played the invaders.  At the beginning of the game, things were so slow I was wondering if I wanted to continue and expressed this.  However, not having played before, I kept with it and found that the game develops as I imagine a real seige would develop.  I started gaining ground, started creating feints and sacrifices in certain areas.  This allowed a well placed Goblin Frenzy that got me over the walls and to victory.  A 3D verion would be awesome and have seen a few.

This title presents you with a lot of choices to make especially where trap laying goes. The defender has a tough row to hoe keeping things in check. The invader has a lot of options to chose from and using all of them is usually a good bet especially if you have more than one invader. The fact that the invaders can be given different abilities every game makes for decent replayability but I can still see it getting stale after a while.

Good game.

Great theme, its quite impressive, how a few wooden cubes can make you feel hemmed by the enemy forces. Lots of emotions at the gaming table guaranteed!

The game is asymmetrical, and this really is important. The Invaders role requires more strategical thinking, and is a bit more demanding in a 1v1 game, while being the Defender is a more reactive role.

While playing as the invader, you have to have a proper mindset. Contrary to intuition, the Defender has time on his side. The games Victory Points mechanics puts the pressure on the Invader. You have to breach the walls by turn 6 or 7, even though the game lasts 10 turns. If you cant make it by then, its most probably too late to win - the defender will have more victory points. Also, you should try to get all the victory points available - for the great siege, for sacrificing goblins on the altar, for having 4 trolls attack a wall etc.

The Defender has to calculate the risks and points all the time and decide how he reacts to threats, so youll be making choices and sometimes you will make bad ones! Still, in 1v1 play, not every mistake will be fatal, and some will be forgiven. Also, the Defending side should be aware of the victory points - sometimes, you should let the invaders into your fortress in a controlled manner at a point where you have more victory points than your opponent.

This actually may be a bit of a disapointment for some players, myself included. Thats why Im planning to get my hands on the expansion "Stronghold: Undead" - I've read that it changes the gameplay significantly, and removes the victory points alltogether. Now, the defenders have to survive 8 turns, using all means necessary! No holding back, no unhonorable actions! We have to withstand the siege until the undead hordes perish under the sunlight!

An immersive strategic game that's almost chess like. I do not like chess because it's very mechanical with no theme. Stronghold resembles chess but oozes with medieval fantasy theme. And for the defenders to defend the castle long enough for all women and children to escape, and then to die with honor, there's nothing more thematic than this. It reminds me of the great castle siege battles that's found in movies such as Lord of the Rings, etc. For me, thematic games always beats game mechanic. And in this case, Stronghold has both. It's a win-win situation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a polished gem of a game that I don't think my group is likely to ever play again. It deserves better than a 7, but based on likelihood of and desire for future play, it's a 7. The problem is the first game, which has a learning curve that's better described as a cliff. It took us five hours from box open to box closed, longer than expected for a game with a 120-minute listed playtime.

Even selling it as a detailed, intricate game that might not be that fun on the first play, the math makes getting this to the table a second time a tough prospect. In 5 hours, we could be playing 3-5 light/medium Euros that we already like, and with free time in short supply, that tends to sound better than delving back into a lengthy game like this.

Which is really too bad, because Stronghold does an amazing job of recreating the feel of a fantasy siege, complete with mental imagery, thematic elements that work as mechanics (of course there'd be archers on those towers, of course I'd man my battering ram with trolls; etc.), practically no downtime, a ton of interesting decisions, and an equal amount of delicious tension. It's a fun game, but it's not a fun 5-hour game.

Is it a fun 3-hour game? Almost certainly -- and in time, maybe even a fun 2-hour game. But with a deep stable of competitors, I'm saddened that it's not likely to get a chance to shine.

---

Two years later, my first play was my only play. This isn't a good fit for my group -- it's too long and fiddly, and we don't play often enough or return to games often enough to warrant the effort it requires. Painful, as I love the theme and concept. Sold it.

Love at first sight! Ressource management + bloody siege, amazing combo. I love the hourglass mechanism. I also love how the attacker can completely change the tempo by flipping over his action cards and go in frenzy assault mode.

RATING: 6
So far, I am really unsure on this game.  Very luck-ish in the first games.  Where luck overrides strategy and there is no catching up.  I play games with plenty of luck, the difference so far seems to be that there are limited key luck points - get lucky and you win, otherwise you lose (as the invader).

I hope this game gets better with more plays.  I certainly want to like it - castle siege is a great theme, even for a game that is fundamentally a euro.

Rating could rise or fall, hard for me to rate after 5 plays.  This is a game like Dungeonlords that I desperately want to like (I haven't gotten there).

This is a game for gamers. Played once with four players. Its a game of resource management at its core. Combat is pretty straight forward. The only luck factor I saw was when siege and castle weapons were fired. However, that little bit of luck in the game has a significant impact which will force you to continually change your strategy as the game progresses.

3 / 5 - Good.

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It's moderately complex but not that excessive and it does create a real sense of directing a siege. The combat isn't as deterministic as is made out, since there are tactics counter and warmachines that contribute random casualties. Not convinced it has immense replay value though.

I might have rated this higher if the rules were not such a mess.  To add to the frustration, the attacker has to know what he's doing. The straight ahead assault is not going to work.  So it takes five hours just to work through the rule mess to learn the game, and then the attacker really has to play a few games to know how to have a chance at breaching the walls.  This adds up to frustration if a couple of newbies break open the box to start to play it.

RATING: 8
Learning Stronghold is like climbing a mountain, difficult and at time dire, but once at the top you know you are experiencing something that is special but sadly unseen by many.  The magic to me is understanding that thinking of Stronghold as the "story of an assault" isn't referring to the entire process of beating on a wall until it falls (which would be a "story of attrition").  "An assault" is referring to a single unified plan that will fire off without a hitch and cement the Invader in history as a masterful tactician.  Using glory as a timer of sorts forces the Invader to take on such a creative and drastic scheme that depends on all the key portions of warfare, especially those centering on using bluffing to draw out the enemy while depriving them of resources (in the form of actions) through various means.  It isn't the story of a combat, rather a specific type of combat, and learning how to become or defend against that type of commander is a wonderful challenge.

Feels like a RTS computer game.  Good thematic elements in what is essentially a eurogame with worker placement, simplified/abstract combat resolution and resource allocation.

Wished there was an (high risk) option for Defenders to mount limited sorties to mess up the attacker's plans.

Such a cool concept for a game. And the way the designer worked in the reasoning for the VP system is genius. The board is amazing to look at. The rules were a bit fuzzy but when they reprinted it, they fixed that problem. I look forward to every play.

Edit:
There seems to be these strange situations where as the defender you're better off letting the invader break in on a turn when he can breach only one section instead of multiple. This is gamey and not thematic at all and creates this horrible meta game

Nice game that really doesn't (seem to) take as long as you'd think. The attacker needs to win fairly quickly - I even felt it was a little like playing Mr Jack where the defender was trying to escape and make the game last as long as possible in order to win.

Now, my wife and I are pretty comfortable with complex rules sets - we taught ourselves Through the Ages, Tide of Iron, Battlelore etc. But, THESE RULES SUCK HARD!! They're poorly translated and really poorly organized.

The board however is gorgeous. So my wife agreed to try to muddle through the game even though I only sorta, kinda, knew what I was doing. It took forever with all of the flipping through the rulebook and faqs and running to the computer to search BGG. We got through two full rounds (after about an hour and a half) and finally called it quits. 

It seemed like there might be a fun game in there, but trying to figure it all out was booooring. We both enjoy Warhammer:Invasion, and I actually think the two games have a lot in common. 

In Warhammer:Invasion:

1. You are besieging a kingdom (from 3 sides instead of 9 or whatever)
2. You acquire resources to buy units and pay for support tactics, spells, siege weapons, etc.
3. There is a large variety of unit and support options.

Yes, Stronghold has the map movement while W:I only has three different fields for each side, but a game of W:I can be finished in 1/2hr. It's also about a third the price and way easier to set up.

That said, we may try Stronghold again in the future. But, I'm kicking myself for pre-ordering it from Essen instead of At The Gates of Loyang, which was the same price and my second choice.

Update: Traded for At The Gates of Loyang. :)

RATING: 3
It's not an epic war game or Ameritrash experience, it's a stinking Euro! That's right! You heard me correctly! This is NOT a battle, it's NOT a fight, it's NOT a struggle of combat attrition. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A SIEGE. Again, players are NOT fighting an epic battle, they are MANAGING RESOURCES. Seriously. It's a cube-fondling game. Players receive resources, they spend them or assign them in various places. Rinse repeat until a winner is declared. It's not really even an elegant Euro - it's fiddly as hell - so many stupid little bits to manage. But in the end, the player or set of players who manages his resources the most efficiently wins, and that's it. There's no chance other than the flipping of occasional cards, and even then that chance diminishes over time. But there's no possibility for the whims of fate to tip the balance one direction or another. The game says it has orcs, and goblins and trolls, but it really has colored cubes. And those colored cubes are really just differently valued resources applied in various ways to the gathering of other resources, to the building of various objects which make resource management and expenditure more effective, or the assigning of those resources to "assault" which really just means a number by number comparison of assigned resources between committed resources by oneself and one's opponent. Sounds a bit like an auction, doesn't it? Gah. Stupid stupid stupid. What were they thinking? This could have been so epic. But it's just another mediocre wood fondler.

My own fault, I didn't do sufficient research here. This is a two-player wargame, and I was thinking it was a several-on-one game. I think I was mentally mixing it with Castle Panic.

After 4 games, the only negative is that it takes too long to play.  I guess both my friend and I have AP.  But other than that, this game rocks!!!

It most definitely is a gamer's game.  Many tough decisions and trade offs.  I played the Defender, and could really feel the tension as I was surrounded by my enemy.  The way luck is handled in the game with the Hit Deck is awesome!  Just enough luck to keep everything on the razors edge.  We both got hosed quite a bit with our Hit Decks :)  I can't believe I lasted as long as I did.

The core rules are actually pretty straightforward (after 1 play).  However, there are some rule nuances that are critical to proper game balance that one can easily miss.  In my opinion, these rule nuances give the game a lot of depth, making for some delicious yet painful decisions that need to be made.

Had to quit after the 7th round (other engagements).  I believe the Invader would have prevailed in the end, but really it was anybody's game.  Outstanding!!!  Lots of fun!!!

The only reason I'm not giving this a perfect 10 is because it runs a bit too long.

Played 1st learning game.  Got several rules wrong, but this is a strong contender.  Initial rating of 9.  Can see raising to a 10 after more plays.

Where do I start?  I think Stronghold is a good, perhaps great, game but the rules make the game almost unplayable.  They are the worst rules I've seen since Return of the Heroes; even the 1st edition Advanced Tobruk rules were better.  My friend and I called the game after 2 turns to start over because we realized we were playing wrong.  We started a second game but it was an exercise in frustration since we spent most of the time trying to decipher the rules.  They are incomplete, contradictory, and opaque.  Stronghold is an expensive game, and now I am shelving it until the rules are rewritten.

Update: Traded.  The War of the Ring: Battles of the Third Age expansion hits my sweet spot for seige games.

A very difficult but yet great 2 player game. One player takes the role of the orcs and goblins attacking the castle, the other player takes the humans that are defending it. Very strategical thinking from both sides but, wow what a game. It feels like "Two Towers" from Lord of the Rings trilogy. You realy feel the tension and the difficult choices that you have to make every round. Draws a little long but it's worth it. A realy neat game.

In this 2-4 player game, attackers are laying seige to a castle. One team are the attackers, another team are the defenders. In this 3 hour long epic game, there are 10 turns. Each turn is broken up into 6 phases, where the last phase is an assault and combat phase. When the attackers do something, they give the defender a hourglass token, which the defender can use. Attackers do things like build catapaults, battering rams, covers for their troops, and use rituals to enhance their combat. Defenders do things such as setting up traps, build cannon, poles, training soldiers for defence, setting up cauldrons and other things for defence. The game ends when the castle is breached and glory points are counted up. On turn 1, the attackers have 10 glory and the defenders have 4 glory. Each turn without a breach, the attackers give a glory to the defenders. Both sides have opportunities to earn more glory by fulfilling certain objectives. For instance, when the castle is breached, the attackers gain 3 glory. 

I have only played the three player game, with 2 attackers versus 1 defender. It's a fun game, with lots of decisions to make, and I am looking forward to more plays. The rules will take you some time to get around, and the game does take 3-4 hours to play. 

Rating likely to rise with more plays.

What an epic game!

Stronghold is a lengthy time commitment of asymmetrical play over the siege of a castle, one side attacking, the other defending.

The gameplay revolves around a unique currency system where attacker sacrifices his units for actions, at varying rates based on the strength of the unit, and each unit sacrificed provides the defender his form of currency: Time. The defender gets very little Time automatically, so the attackers choices basically fund his ability to organize a defense, which makes play for him very reactive. This logical system infuses Stronghold with an immersive level of theme, allowing players to visualize the siege almost as a miniatures game.

Stronghold can be played as a 3 or 4 player game, but is best played with 2. As there are only 2 factions, splitting them up between 4 players is likely to feel as if one is only getting half the experience. Plus, it may make a lengthy game even longer. It might be okay with 3, with 2 people playing the attacker as their side of the board is split into 2 sections.

Stronghold has been released in a 2nd edition, but I prefer the 1st. The streamlining done to the 2e removes several of the advanced elements from the original game, and also removes the Glory system, which I found to be a vital element for gameplay immersion in the 1e; it was like army morale. Instead, all the defender needs to do is last 8 rounds. Whoopie-doo. Finally, the 2e board is way, way uglier. The only upgrade I see is the defender's components, which are pretty cool. There is word of an upgrade kit for the 1e, but nothing official yet.

RATING: 6
A fine game with way too many things going on.  I really wanted to love this game, however there are so many things going on in this game it just feels convoluted.  There is a lot of tension and there are many mechanics that were very interesting and appealing, such as the time mechanism that keeps the two teams on even ground and how each group will have different weapons available to them each game for variability.  

In the end, Stronghold tried to do too much I think, and got buried by it's wealth of options and the rules for those options.

The drafting scheme boosts replayability by making the games a bit different from each other. It also removes some AP by limiting the options available during the game. The gameplay has a nice German feel because the resources are scarce and you have to keep planning ahead.

Unfortunately, that's where the good things end, and the rest of the package is definitely not up to par. The game is way too long compared to what it offers. And most of all, the rulebook is a crime against humanity: It is unbelievably badly structured, and full of ambiguities. The "rewritten version" in the files section is a joke: This rulebook needs to be rewritten and restructured from the scratch before it will be of any use to anyone.

RATING: 6
(Rating after two game with two players) 

It's just "ok". Maybe I'm not a target for this game.

For eurogamer, Stronghold feels like a too long area control game with doze of luck.

Pluses:
- strong theme
- beautiful board and good quality of all components;

Minuses:
- quite big luck factor (and I have to admit that I'm NOT a control freak)
- some unbalanced elements (battering ram!)
- too long for what it is (I don't feel that this is an epic game. I feel that this is too long game, sorry)
- many gaps in rules (and I play with FAQ!)

I don't get the hype about this one...

Good solid game, let down badly by a less than well written (translated into English?) rulebook that leaves too many unanswered questions.

RATING: 4
Mixed first impressions with a tendency for a higher rating with more plays and/or radical modification by introduction of more randomizing elements especially in combat resolution. 

This game is not - repeat NOT - a hybrid. It is a pure, however thematic heavy 2-player euro, not only on the surface due to the massive use of wooden cubes, but also as an effect of resource management and action selection mechanisms, and a almost deterministic combat system. The game is still confrontational and innovative as there are 2 totally different play styles required; also, I think the mechanism of direct analogue compensation for the opponent for each action the invader takes is pretty clever, elegant and thematically sound. Some ideas are neat, like those siege engines steadily improving their aiming each round. It's altogether really interesting (a lot of "meaningful decisions" blabla, y'know)... but it creates a dry atmosphere of abstractness and lacks excitement due to the computable results. 

I did enjoy the game anyway, but in all honesty: I think its NEEDS DICE. Yes, dice. Example: Why don't  defender's archers gain any cover bonuses whatsoever while standing behind fortifications, while Goblin Archers stay invincible behind barricades while snipering a defender's archer each with guaranteed success? Why are soldiers and veterans immune against archers? I don't get it, and I don't like it. It's unthematic and unrealistic. The whole combat system is totally boring. Why not indroduce a random element, and get more tension and fun into the game? Declare a ranged attack, calculate modificators, roll for success - that would be cool! With dice based resolution, this might get a feeling similar to Chaos in the Old World or Wallenstein.

(Just to underline that again: It IS an interesting game, no doubt about that.)

UPDATE 11/2015: I think I just tried to be fair to the game and the design with what I wrote above, but in all honesty, I really have no desire to play the game again. Dropped the rating by 2.

This game went from a 9 to a 10 after my third game. This is just an incredible game. I can't wait to get this to the table again. The gameplay fits the theme so well. You really feel like you are invading or defending a castle. It always feels very tense and close. I love the asymmetrical gameplay. The expansion will be an instant purchase for me. The is a lot of variability in the units you can select so there is an incredible amount of replay ability. The new rule book in the valley games edition is pretty well written and I love that it has a seperate rulebook for both the invader and defender. That was an excellent touch. If you are willing to put a bit of time in learning the rules you will be rewarded with an excellent game. It feels like a euro/war game. There is very little luck, but just enough to keep it tense.

A slow game to learn and initially play, as the invader has so many options on how to spend their 14 troops each turn, be it a whole bunch of ways to build stuff for extra hit points, or just attack en masse. Then the approach is to set up enough simultaneous attacks across the 10 or so walls so the defender can't cover everything, whilst maximising usage of your built stuff. All of which takes a fair while to set up. So there's lots of planning by the invader while it all comes together. Then there's the agony for the defender ... how do you spend the action points you're given by the defender (you spend roughly equal to what he spends, which may be a little or a lot depending on what he's done before) to cover all of the threats, not knowing which of the secret orders will be blowing up walls and which will triple the value of the orcs. And if you can't, which one's a bluff. Which makes for a reactive but still interesting game. The game needs to be quicker for replay, but only replay will give enough familiarity to allow faster turns, a catch-22. Still, there's not much out there like this, and the asynchonicity and option wealth is an attraction. Lots of options means lots of rules to learn though. The match to theme seems dead on - as the defender, you feel the scrambling to deploy your reserves to strengthen weak walls. Overall it's a like and will see more play, but only with fellow gamers who like this kind of stuff.

Fabulous game! A new favourite for sure. This game has great theme, very well implemented mechanics and very tense game-play for both players. I thought the defender might not be as exciting as the attacker, but it's not true, it's very rewarding to try withstanding the attacking forces.

This game is very very good! Might climb up the ladder to the top after some mote plays.

- Rulebooks are not super but work ok. The game is tough to master and needs at least one test play with both players seriously committed to learn the game. Also, different gaming mechanics for both players means that players need to get familiar with both sides.

Such a simple premise, but so well presented. At first, with all the tokens, it seems daunting, but you only play with a few. There are basically six stages, where you get men, machines, equipment, spells and then send your men in to attack. Once you get the basics down, as the attacker you must devise a way to breach the stronghold. The defender reacts based on the amount of time he is given, but must anticipate what will come next, slowing down his opponent.

When I play it, I love it - it brings out the worst of the Dungeon Keeper in me, throwing goblins at the wall and orcs pounding on the knights. I don't want to like this game, but I think about it for so long after I play it, that even though I don't want to like this game, (with all it's fiddly bits and the if-then/what-if rules) I end up pondering it at length. I don't want to like it, it's too strategic, it's too black and white, it's too not what-I-think-I-want-in-a-game...but I can't get this game out of my head. I don't want to learn all the rules, but I obsess over them none-the-less. I am hexed to like this game.

Thematic 2 (or more)-player siege game, with a lot of (fiddly) options. Each game the attacker has different tools, which is nice. One game they might build trenches and use poison, and in the next they have siege towers and special artillery. They defender can do a lot of stuff too: training troops, reinforcing walls, building traps and cannons, casting spells &c. Every piece of wall has its strengths and weaknesses, and needs to be managed properly.

If you can get into the theme, there's a nice back-and-forth of tactics. The attacker builds a battering ram, the defender counters with archers near the gate, then the attacker uses siege towers to get orcs to engage the archers in melee, and the defender sabotages the siege tower.

However, I feel the game can't stand on its own, without the theme. There are so many options, and all you really do is push cubes around and manage numbers. Killing a troll with a sharpshooter from the cathedral tower sounds awesome, but what you're really doing is spending two discs to reduce the opponent's strength by three.

Ultimately, that is what decides if this is a game for you: are you seeing a ton of stuff to do, with traps and bridges, goblins and orcs and trolls, trebuchets and battering rams, cauldrons and cannons, heroes and saboteurs and ladders and banners and magic rituals? Or are you seeing a mess of rules and calculating numbers and pushing cubes?

Personally, I'd rather play a themeless abstract with clean rules than a fiddly game with a great theme, so I don't think Stronghold is a game for me.

It is great how different the sides play (as compared to most other 2-player games) and with the random setup,the game is quite random in its setup (apart from card draws etc.). Am really impressed by the design, although the rulebook is terrible (and the million reference sheets available are not much of a help either). Apart from that, great game and a candidate for a 10 (depending on how the advanced game plays)

Euro with direct conflict.  The attacker and defender has so many options.  When the attacker advances, the defender gets time to build his defenses.  Right now, this is one of the few games that I consider a masterpiece because of the mechanics and the theme.

After decyphering the rules (with a load of help from BGG etc) and playing solitaire, it seems like a pretty decent game. It's a good example of how frakked up the rules can be and it's missing a lot of simple things.

I'll renew the rating once I've played it with someone, but it'll prolly go up a notch.

I've played this 5 times already, and am definitely convinced that there is a decided advantage to the defender.

This game has a lot of clever interesting things in it, but it's *very* clunky and fiddly.  There is just so much to do, so much stuff to move around, etc.  I also think the game is a bit too long.  The last game I played was with another familiar player, so we weren't slowed down by any rules clarifications or any of that, and it still took as a solid 2+ hours.  I don't mind long games, but it feels like if this was shorter it could be feasible to switch sides and play again, but that's definitely not going to happen.

Every time I've played this, I've felt totally drained by the end of it, needing to play light filler if I'm going to keep games going.

Good siege game that is thematic and has good game mechanics. However with more plays, a standard set of "optimal" moves is emerging due to the way the scoring mechanics work, making for possibly same same repetitive games after a while.

RATING: 5
I like this game, but there are some flaws. Ram doesn't really work in 2er. No fog of war. Too few 2er cards for attacker to choose from (possible fix: Take 2 3-4er cards for each phase - that way you can have combinations 2er cards just don't offer). 2er and 3-4er play balance is completely different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A strategic game for the attacker, with a huge variety of possibilities rewarding intelligent play. The defender must anticipate the onslaught and react quickly. A game of resource management, planning, and deception. Very long rules (amongst the most confusing I've come across) and hard to get going. An asymmetric 2p game that doesn't fall into the abstract or card game categories, which is hard to find.

Played my first game and took 3 1/2 hours and got to the sixth turn. I almost broke through but the defender used one of the specials, removed his glory and moved some reinforcements to the wall section where I was about to enter the stronghold. Fantastic game, lots of strategy, a bit of luck with the card drawn war machines. I look forward to the next game, maybe I'll try and break through the front gates this time or head around the flanks, spread out my forces and make the defender react by having fewer support units on the walls in locations.

Reminds me very favorably of the Helm's Deep battle from "Lord of the Rings."  It is long, meticulous and deep -- more like chess than Risk.  Three hours is about right.  The invader is more fun, but harder to win.  The defender is reactive and tense.

The English rules are a mess.  Even if you read both the official and unofficial FAQs, you will still have no idea how to dispatch correctly.  Read the rules threads -- they help immensely, and it's worth it for the great game play.

A bit too epic for my taste. I think that I would rate it an 8 in the right mood, it certainly deserves that based on gameplay, but its really too long. If I were to play it more I might rate it higher, since I wouldn't have to consult the rulebook nearly as often.

RATING: 8.5
The theme reminds me of teh battle of Helm's Deep in the LOTR movie. I especially (and personnally) love the 4-player version, as our old saying goes 'entertain everyone rather than yourself'. This is almost a vast game. I spent nearly a whole week reading and summarizing the rules, and at my first play I still got too many details to handle, and I had to review the rulebook again and again. The assymetric player power is a necessary devil. Good for playing, bad for teaching.

Awesome assymetrical 2-player-game regarding theme, game board and artwork. Unfortunately it feels a bit unbalanced towards the defending player (maybe exactly this is thematical, though). What I really like about gameplay is how the defending player can decide to use his actions (time) in order to give the attacker the same amount of time.
I traded it away before trying out the attacking role. At least I could add the "Heroes" mini expansion.

The little cubes are men, or orcs, or trolls, or goblins. If you can get that into mind, this game feels far more epic than it has any right to be. 

The tactics are interesting, and the game almost always goes down to the wire. The defenders seem to have a very slight advantage, but that could just be ease-of-play, and it certainly dosen't make me want to play this game any less.

RATING: 9
Brilliant!  Playing the defender is a genuinely tense affair -- fully immersive and intense, in attempting to keep the invader out (or, at least, at bay for a while longer)

Seems to be rather difficult for the invader to win, and even a single breach is a bit of a moral victory.

Great stuff!!

RATING: 3
This one quickly went from most anticipated to decided indifference to biggest disappointment of the last two years. The theme and mechanisms (on an individual level) sound so cool and amazing, but the mechanisms don't mesh, together and with the theme.

After going through all the thematic elements and artwork, you really need minis for the troops, instead of colored cubes, to complete the immersive experience. And some parts of the rules are just weird, like when the attacker chooses casualties when blood shots hit (homing blood shots??). In my first game, I also deliberately let the castle fall, because that'd end the game with enough points for me to win. That just didn't seem right to me.

Game-wise, there's a ton of preparation (far too long) involved for the siege, and when the armies finally collide, there is no tension at all because it's all excessive micromanagement. It's like being unable to appreciate the epic scale of battles in Starcraft because you're furiously clicking away the whole time. The attacker phones in a strategy in the first half, then both sides see how it pans out in the 2nd half of the game. I really hate this kind of "run a build order" game, especially when it takes as long as 2 hours for Stronghold (1 hour preparing, 1 hour resolving). It feels a lot like the attacker is solving a puzzle and the defender is merely an adaptive AI. Either way, this whole thing feels like a puzzle waiting to be solved, with the game playing you with all the random effects. Not at all like a siege, since there is little tension. When the tension ratchets up, the game is usually over.

I really wished to like this because its hour-glass mechanism is the first board-game version of the treasured twilight-pool mechanism in Lord of the Rings TCG which I’ve experienced.

I say remove all those tiny fiddly, somewhat excessive "thematic flavor" rules (and add them on with expansions), and focus on a more satisfying core gameplay of feinting and attacking. Have more action be at the walls, with dormant threats on all sides and bigger threats on one or two sides, instead of forcing the attacker to probe only one or two sides at a time. As it is, War of the Ring has much better tension and Napoleon's Triumph has much better attack-feint gameplay, and I'd gladly trade in the extra hour of game time to play those two. Stronghold actually feels like a single locale in NT blown up and overfed with excessive rules and details.

I'd still try this one more time as the attacker.

Сложная в разборе правил игра дуэльного типа из жанра Tower Defence. Много разных интересных придумок тактического характера. Куча функционала и широкий диапазон действий. Все механики хотя и старые, но довольно оригинальные. В игре - партия идёт быстро и  легко, хотя и требует периодического почесывания репы. С опытным соперником даунтайма быть не должно. К третьей партии, когда правила более-менее устаканиваются в голове от игры начинаешь получать истинное удовольствие и она начинает идти как по маслу. Механика замены карт Фаз Захватчика особенно крута! Позволяя резко поднять порог реиграбельности от партии к партии. Сейчас бы подобные карты обязательно выпустили бы в качестве дополнения и подобного разнообразия тактик в одной коробке маркетологи не допустили бы. Вообще игра полностью оправдала ожидания, так как брал её именно как игру на роль лучшего представителя данного стиля. Оценка должна была бы быть большей, но явный дисбаланс при игре вдвоём в сторону Защитника и обратный дисбаланс в сторону Захватчиков при игре втроём, немного портит впечатление об игре.

RATING: 8
Works great as a 2,3 or 4 player. Ideal as a 2... but scales well. Very incremental and slow going. However, the tension does build nicely and is always a challenge for both sides. I think this is an excellent game design and beautiful. In order to play correctly I had to dissect the rulebook 3 or 4 times, print of the FAQ from the geek and I even watched the BGG Essen Booth video. We are finally playing correctly (we hope). The headache of learning the rules was indeed worth the effort on this one. The game does tend to run long. The theme is nicely brought together with the mechanics.

Stronghold isn't perfect. The rulebooks are shite (even in the 2nd edition) and there are some silly ways how the rules work. But once you have everything figured out it plays rather nicely and does not take too long. Contrary to the popular opinion that the defenders have the edge I actually think that it's easier to win with the attacker if U know your business.

It's not the most realistic game as it ends immediately after the attacker has the stronghold breached (the defender might still win). Specific cauldrons kill only specific type of attackers and so forth. But it's got cannons, ballistas, catapults, trebuchets, battering rams and pretty much everything else you'd expect in a siege game. For those complaining that the game needs figures to represent the troops I'd like to ask do you really need  cheap plastic figures every friggin time? Really?

[2013-08-17]
A kétjátékos társasok virágkorát éljük, úgyhogy épp aktuális volt kipróbálni ezt a "nagy öreget". Régóta szemeztem vele, mert a háborús játék eurócsomagban nagyon biztatónak tűnt. Ez a játék tényleg euró és tényleg két személyre van kitalálva. Az egyik fél a várat védi, a másik pedig a rengeteg szörnyével támad. Jöjjenek a pozitívumok. Asszimetrikus két oldal. Teljesen más a két játékos lehetősége a játékban. Nagy változatosság a felhasználható támadó eszközökben, ami minden játékban változhat. Óriási szabadsága a védőnek is. Rettentően jól megoldott időhasználat. A támadó által felhasznált egységek száma ad plusz időt a védőnek. Kicsi, de szép komponensek, számomra átlátható tábla.
Negatívumok: Azt hittem már megtaláltam a legveszélyesebb AP játékot, hát nem, ugyanis a Stronghold az. Tipikusan igaz rá, hogy lehet komolytalanul nem gondolkozva is akciókat választani, de annál komolyabb a játék, viszont ha mindent ki akarunk valamilyen szinten számolni, akkor akár órák telhetnek el egy-egy körrel és mivel egymás után jön a két fél, ezért ha a támadó befejezte a részét, akkor igazából olvasgathat is, mert nem tud már befolyásolni semmit a védő körében. Tehát sajnos nagy az üresjárat. Érdekes megoldás a győzelmi pontok kérdése. A játékban nem a vár elfoglalása a cél, hanem a megfelelő időpontban való betörés. Nálunk rögtön az első játék alkalmával kijött, hogy mivel későn törtem be, igazából a védő feladata annyi volt, hogy pontosan egy helyen engedjen be, amivel nem szerzek annyi győzelmi pontot, amivel az övét túl tudom haladni. Tehát hiába vettem be a várat, már nem győzhettem. Ez további játékok alkalmával dőlne csak el, hogy mennyire esélytelen a támadó ilyen helyzetben a későbbi körökben.
Szóval a Stronghold megítélésem szerint igazi rétegjáték, hosszú holtidőktől irtózók nagyon kerüljék el, viszont akik szeretnek számolni és kedvelik barátjukkal, párjukkal a háborús témát próbálják ki, mert alapvetően jó játékkal van dolgunk. A pontszám nálam csak azt tükrözi, hogy nem az én játékom, alapvetően 7-est érdemelne, 1-1 pont mínusz az AP és reménytelen helyzet miatt.

The rules and icons are a pain. They're a lot of work to get through. But underneath is an asymmetric worker placement game with clever mechanics, direct conflict, and a great theme. The board is beautiful--strongly evocative of the theme, even if the cubes aren't. The game is definitely unique. My concern is that while I've decisively won as the defender in my plays, it's hard to see what the attacker could have done differently, which hardly motivates me to play again.

RATING: N/A
This is a special game. The theme is very interesting and very clear at first - one player has to get in some other player fortress. 

I confess that I would rather want a straight human themed game than one like this with goblins, orcs and trolls which I find stupid (that's the expression).

Despite all that I insisted on this game because it seemed designed for 2 players and it's not a classic wargame and I'm glad I did. It's a very good game with maybe some balance issues (defender seems to have advantage) and with a lot of stuff going on.

The designer insisted on the mythic creatures maybe because he wanted the game to get more unrealistic and spectacular options and he got it right at some point. 

The thing is that if you're playing as the invader there's a lot going on and there's a lot to learn, not only because there's a huge amount of planning but also because there are loads of options to take.

The scoring system is interesting because it makes the game a rush in time on which the invader can't afford to make any mistakes or even take any risks.

The turning point seems to happen on the 6th turn where the defender, if not yet invaded, probably wins the game.

I'm not really sure of how this game will make through time but for now I guess it's a good investment. Playing on each side gives a totally different experience and that's part of the charm of the game. Despite all of that being the defender it's not that interesting, specially when comparing to what the attacker has to do.

Overall a solid design.

Very pretty board and components.  I got it to play with one of my friends, but he didn't care for it.  I didn't love it either, honestly.  The deterministic combat seems a little strange.  Win conditions are very difficult for the invader player.  Maybe very skilled players can mitigate that, but it seems that if the invader hasn't won by the fifth turn, he stands no chance.  So why even have ten turns?

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Was really wanting to try this game and it left me wanting to try it again soon.  I played as the defender.  We did have four players but played the two player rules in two teams.  The theme is very appealing to me.  The overall choices and game play seemed to work well.  I have heard the game favors the defenders and while we did win it felt like a very close tight game.  The game itself was much smaller than the I was expecting.  The board and pieces are smaller than a lot of game now days.

A terrific 2-player game just dripping with theme. It takes  a little while to set up and play, but it's well worth it. It always goes over well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
During the first few plays, I was amazed. The game theme was chosen very well and Stronghold has the incredible climate. You feel the pressure of time (in both roles: as Invader and Defender) and you like multiple combinations of Invader's deadly weapons and Defender's counter-measures. You are getting up in the morning, planning the evening siege in your head... It's really engrosing. And you even don't pay attention on the messy rulebook and ugly tiles.

But, after 10 games, you see the weaknesses. For 2p, the game is clearly not balanced - Defender will win most of the games, unless Invader has really good machines and training options: siege towers, ladders and the trainer is a very strong combination. It is combined with another game's flaw: some of the Invader's options are very weak, e.g. battering ram or altar and just not worth to use at all. So, the initial choice of phase 2-5 cards determines the game and favours Defender in straight majority of games. Moreover, the game has rather low replayability (you clearly know what to do) especially if you are Defender. 

Number of plays: 11-12.

The rule book is famously bad; even with the updated 2010 versions it is still a drag (seriously, no index/glossary?!). It didn't take as long as Arkham Horror to learn (1.5 days vs. a whole 3 day weekend), but it was a bit of a struggle and we probably added 60 - 90 minutes to the game with rule checks/clarifications and just plain looking up things I couldn't remember.

That said, it is totally worth the investment to learn. The game mechanics are actually relatively intuitive once you get going and the theme fits beautifully. The board is lovely and the game felt tense the whole way through (with the exception of maybe the first 20 minutes).

Even though I played badly (and didn't even manage to breach the walls!), I can't wait to play this again and neither can the other player!

Teaching it to people is a bit of a 'mare as it is asymmetrical and there is a lot to take on board...

Update: Rating dropped from 8.2 to 7.9 to reflect my continuing failure to breach and frustration at doing so.

Ultimately traded away as I lack the enthusiasm to teach it to new people and Oliver also has a copy.

A hybrid of a eurogame and wargame. Eurogame mechanics, time and character more of an wargame. A strong theme. The game is long, but full of emotions. 

The defender can`t make a mistake. He will lose. The invader has at ther beginning a more comfortable situation, but when he will be not optimalise his atack, he will be lose. As longer the will be, the better is the situation of the defender. 

Some problem could be the "eurogame win". When the defender has 4+ points more than the invader, he could let him pass on 1 part of the walls. The invader gets 3 points, but the gane is over and the defender wins with 1+. 

Edit after the 3rd play:
The battering ram don`t work well. The cost is too high.

Round 7. I (the defender) have 11 points, the invader 7. The bigein of ther assault. I must defend the catle the 7th time. I must defend? No! I let the invader break in on 1 part of the wall, he gain 3 points, so he will have 10 and i will win 11:10.

I don`t like it. It`s too much "eurogaming". The problem is, the game has a very strong theme. The mechanic is for me more important than the setting. But this game has a interesting theme with a good mechanic. And this glory points don`t siut to the climatic game. It would be better when the defender wins, when he defend the siege, and the invader when he breaks in. The game could then have 7 rounds (it is hard for the invader to win in the 8 round and i think almost imposible to win in round 9 or 10).

Enjoyable; better the 2nd time once you get all the systems down.  Early on the attacker should build catapults and use the saboteur constantly; later on just rush the walls.  Defender needs to be very wary and flexible; the right mix of heroes, traps and cauldrons saves the day.  If there was only some way to take away the cover from those damned sniping goblins...

I have grave concerns about replayability, even with the attacker's configurable action cards.  The only turn-to-turn stochastic elements are the bag draw and the siege engines, so optimum strategies for both sides seem inevitable...

Very interesting game. Another east european Euro with strong, or at least unusual,thematic background. I very much like the mechanics (attacker produce time for the defenders to use) and the generally very clever design. But there are just too many options. It feels fiddly and overloaded.
So it is definitly a game for people, who plan to play it often. If you just plan to play it from time to time, you might find it too confusing.

Yeah, this is a cool game. Very cool in fact. Lots of options and I love how the game is played so differently from the two sides of the table. Will be interesting to see where they take this with expansion. 

The nature of this game being the "goodies" vs. the "baddies" makes this a superb and probably "Best At" 2 player game.

[thing=45986][/thing] is a tower defense game (city, in the case) in which the invaders = globins, orcs and trolls - amass forces and effects in order to siege and breach into the city, while the human defenders desperately try to prevent the invasion to happen, even when facing a much bigger strength, as the invaders armies are relentless and doesn't seems to have an infinite amount of arms to throw against the city walls - and the humans also set to themselves a higher goal: not only to resist as much as possible, but also do it with honor and glory. And the invaders also want to crush the puny defenders in order to show their mighty and unmatched glory of their army.

In a super-ultra-summary (as the gameplay is filled with rules, as there are even two manuals - one for the defenders and one for the invaders) as rules are: the game lasts for up to 10 rounds (can be less, but never more than 10) and at the start of each round the Invader receives 5 resources and 14 units, draw randomly from a bag. There are three types of units: goblins (strenght 1), orcs (str 2) and trolls (str 3), and the quantities of them isn't equal. The drawn from the bag thematically works well: the hordes of them aren't the most trustworthy or on time.

Each round is composed by 6 phases and, in each, the invader player do stuff, and everything she does uses time (the player is using his soldiers to build, trainning, equipping, making rituals and so on) and this gives time for the defenders to prepare the defence. Actions might also use resources. For instance, build a catapult costs 6 resources, and also requires the player to decide: will you use 1 troll or 2 orcs to build it? The troll, alone, is better in the attack, but will make the catapult in 1 time, while the orcs can be replaced more easily in the battle, however it will cost 2 times to build using them.

After the Invader completes her decisions, the turn passes to the Defender, which will use the amount of time received. There are several options for the Defender and, unlike the Invader, she can start actions and not complete them at once (like starting to build a cannon, which costs 4 time, in one phase she can use 2 time to put 2 markers there and wait for 2 more later on to finish the cannon). Also, the Defender can do whatever action she wants, there isn't a proper order to them as there is for the Invader (build, equip, train, rituals and move, in this order) - so the Defender can train a unit in phase 2 and build a cannon in phase 5, if she has the available time).

For the Invaders, the last phase will always be the movement - and for them the movement is more complex: there are two types - move 7 (costas 5 time) and move 5 (costs 3 time), and both can be used, separately (meaning the same unit can be moved twice). The number of the movement says how many units the Invader can move from camp to the foreground, from the foreground to the ramparts and from the ramparts to the walls. Excess units in the ramparts and the camps stay there, up to a limit (10 in the each foreground, 7 in each rampart). At first will be easy not let many units behind, but when they start to climb the walls and stay there, in a fierce fight, more and more starts to stay behind, waiting for their turn, sometimes under arrows and cannon fire of the Defenders. Finally, the Invader can give orders to her troops - there are one for each type of unit and two blank (only to bluff). The Invader can use one revealed order for free - basically, the only thing that doesn't give time for the Defender. Or she can use [u]all[/u] the orders, putting them face down, in a place in the wall where there is at least one unit of the type of the order - using all the order give the Defender 1 time. The orders allow the trolls to move between places, the orcs to carry explosives and blow themselves to destroy parts of the wall, and the goblins to enter in a frenzy state, which will give each of the +3 strength, but all will die afterwards.

Only to give some notion, a set of options available for the Invader (as this can, and probably will, change play to play): build catapults, siege towers and battering rams; build bridges, shields and banners of war; train the artillery, fast movement and recruit; make rituals (spells) for blood stones, gale and spectres.

Some of the Defender options (these will always be the same): heal units in the Hospital; build traps, cannons, cauldrons, poles, platforms, walls and gate reinforcements; send scouts (to make traps, attack siege towers, and damage machines); pray for unearthly glares (stops fight in a section of the wall), bless the marksmen and the sharpshooters, and to mix the Invader orders); train marksmen into soldiers and soldiers into veterans; use guards to find saboteurs; use the Honor Guard; use the Heroes - the Officer can give speeches that makes the defending units stronger, and the Warrior can kill enemy units and also rises the defending strength of the wall section he is in.

Now, the [i]twist[/i] of the game is that the fight, though important, isn't really the only thing: glory is what matters. The Invaders start with lots of glory, but every round the Defenders resist, they lose glory to them. Both sides have conditions that, when met, give glory = for example: starting from the 6th round, if the Defender haven't use the Honor Guard, the Defenders will gain 1 glory each round. The Invaders gain glory when attacking 7 wall sections of the city, and when concentrate 4 trolls in the same fight, and every time a gate is destroyed (there are three defending the city), and finally when the Invaders breach the wall, they gain glory. The Defenders, as a desperated measure, can use Dishonorable Deeds (forced labor, shameful negotiations, open the dungeons) in order to use some actions in the defense of the city. The player with the highest glory when the city is breached wins the game. If the game ends in 10th round, without the city being breached, the Defenders win outright.

Now, what is my evaluation? A darn good game! And I must say this isn't in my like-like type of game: I'm not particularly fond of competitive 2 players games - they usually have an amount of tension that doesn't make me all that confortable when playing. Still, I quite enjoyed [thing=45986][/thing]. And this one can still be played with 2 teams of 2 players (though the recommended number is two). It is, indeed, filled with tension and with decisions. The choices are agonizing - do more and give more time for the Defenders? Or avoid doing as much as possible to give little time for reaction? Is painful to see your troll horde neutralized by a glare, and the constant killing of units due to the cauldrons. And is certainly isn't easier for the Defenders, even though they do have a more reaction-y type of decisions to make.

Combate is deterministic - units have strenght of 1, 2 or 3 - just add the strenght of everyone on in the section of the wall, add bonuses (from stone walls, heroes, banners, etc), and the side with the greatest amount wins the fight there - the defeated side loses units to equal the gap between the strengths. For example: two trolls (str 3x2) and three orcs (str 2x3) attack one veteran (str 3x1) and two marksmen (str 1x2) that are behind one set of stone wall (str 2) and one of wood (str 1). The total for the attackers is 12 and the defenders is 8. The gap is 4, so the veteran (3) and a marksmen (1) go to the Hospital. Now only one marksmen defends that section! More troops are needed there, and fast!

But there is luck in the game: units for the Invader are drawn randomly from a bag. The catapult, when built, gets a 7 card deck, with 5 miss cards and 2 hit cards - every round, when attacking, one card is drawn. If it is a miss, the card is taken out of the deck - the artillery-goblins are learning the best way to position the machine. The hits always stay in the deck - if it is drawn, it is shuffled back. So, though the chances in this matter increases with the misses, it is possible (but no probable) to miss 5 times in a row. The Defender also have a deck for the Pole and Cannon attacks - it works differently, but luck can also make them almost useless. But, I can't say that luck plays a major role - it will be just like is usually is, sometimes helpful, sometimes, a bastard.

Our playtime was long when comparing with the expected time - 3 hours, however, giving more plays, I can see this going down to the declared 2 hours. I surely wasn't looking at the clock, as I was immersed in the game. Even though all the units are colored cubs, my mind was racing with the possibilities and the dripping theme present - the art in the board is simply amazing!

So, to sum it up, [thing=45986][/thing] goes well recommended for those interested in a 2 (maybe 4) player game, competitive and thematic, that aren't afraid of the 2+ hours for playtime and the amount of decisions and choices the game offers. I will say again: the theme is strong, even without miniatures, you just have to use more imagination to picture all the nasty battles happening everywhere.

[b]Bonus round - For the Glory![/b] - how [thing=45986][/thing] fares when compared against other competitive 2 players games?

[thing=45986][/thing] vs. [thing=36932][/thing]

- Painted miniatures against cubes
- Similar overall production
- One side also has conducts the game more than the other 
- Greater variety for [thing=36932][/thing], even though this one is scenario-based, as the scenarios are randomly built
- Greater randomness for [thing=36932][/thing] (attacks are resolved by rolling dice and also the montage of the scenarios can hinder or help)
- The duration of one play of [thing=36932][/thing] tends to last around 25% less
- [thing=45986][/thing] is more complex for both sides


[thing=45986][/thing] vs. [thing=115746][/thing]

- The scope of [thing=115746][/thing] is much bigger and epic, as it is an all-out war with several fronts instead of a single siege  (by the way, [thing=45986][/thing] could very well be an adaptation of the Shadow attack on Minas Tirith)
- The ordinary duration of a [thing=45986][/thing] is superior (around 3 to 5 hours)
- Dozens of miniatures x hundreds of cubes
- Combat resolved by rolling dice modified by cards (or not) ([thing=45986][/thing]) against deterministic combat (luckless)
- Both involve fantastic medieval scenarios
- Similar complexity


[thing=45986][/thing] vs. [thing=54625][/thing]

- Cubes don't require assembly
- [thing=45986][/thing] isn't published by GW
- The production value of [thing=54625][/thing] is almost unrivalled
- Variety coming from fixed scenarios against variety coming from different sets of actions for the Invaders
- The duration of plays of [thing=54625][/thing] stay around 90 minutes

Tras cada fase le pasa relojes de arena gastados al defensor, que hace sus movimientos tacticos. Tras las 6ª fase asalto, primero ataque a distancia: disparo cañones defensor, disparo maquinas de asedio invasor, disparo arqueros defensor, disparo arqueros goblins invasor, combate cuerpo a cuerpo: calderos defensor, pertigas defensor, ordenes invasor y combate.

Stronghold is a 2-4 player game telling the story of a siege. Players take opposite sides, one has to defend the stronghold, the other has to break into the castle as soon as possible. As time passes, defenders get Victory Points every turn for their efforts on the walls.
The game board represents the stronghold itself as well as the surrounding terrain, where enemy forces are placed and from where they proceed to the walls.
The defender has a small amount of soldiers manning the walls, while the invader has an infinite legion of them! A desperate fight is taking place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them and use black magic rituals to achieve victory. Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.

I think that this game is expressing the siege warfare very well.
I think that having been designed on the assumption that the siege warfare by which reinforcements do not come surrenders induced this success. 
It was reminded of Mozi st Zhao of China in the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, or the Battle of the Hornburg.

When I played this game, since a cube with a mere color is visible to Trolls and Goblins, it is wonderful. 

Unfortunately I wanted the first edition that a promotion CD of "Crystal Viper" was contained in together.

Asymmetric games are quite tough to design simply because it is a challenge to balance game play such that both players have a reasonable chance of winning. While one player can have a slight advantage, this advantage cannot be so huge that the opposing player feels frustrated at the game play. Unlike cooperative games where players all win or lose against the game system, losing to a human opponent repeatedly because of a game imbalance can be really demoralizing. The amount of balance required and the tweaking of numbers to achieve this balance must be phenomenal. Stronghold is a very complex asymmetric game where one player defends a castle while the other player tries to invade it in 10 turns. While the decision-tree is quite complex and the players are inundated with choice, the goals are straightforward: Breach the castle walls and win enough glory points to beat castle defender. The game is good, but not sure if it great. The game is complex and lots of fiddly choices but the path is always clear for the invader: Move the units, breach the walls. It feels a lot of work just to get to the core mechanic of this game. The defender has a more passive role in responding to the area and method of attack. The glory point system feels tacked on and a little odd thematically. Breaching the castle walls without enough glory points and the invader fails. However, I understand the necessity of employing the glory point system to create tension in the game play. This game deserves several more plays to flesh out my final opinion on it

Cooooooool.  The nods to Tolkein's (and now Peter Jackson's) battle of Helm's Deep are sprinkled throughout, but the division from the theme helps the game remain not bound to the feeling of "just another LotR game."  The defender and attacker have very different games to play.  There's plenty of maneuvering and punch/counterpunch to keep a lot of replay in this one.  My one hesitation is that the absolutely stunning amount of choices by both the defender and the attacker are not all valid.  Some of the choices, such as the marksman, are almost compulsory, while others, like the battering ram, seem almost to be diversions.  Some of the choices, then, for a good game are illusory.  For best play, do this always, but never do this.  That said, it seems an impossible task to balance this number of interrelating mechanisms and still make sure each and every combination of strategies is balanced, and so I'm willing to cut the game a bit of slack and enjoy it for what it is.

Truly fantastic game! 1vs1 is the only mode I have tried it, but I think it is the same with 3 or 4. Great strategy game, bluffing involved, unique way the defender plays (depends on the attacker). You should try it! Tip: You should know that if by the 7th round the attacker has not entered the castle, then it is certain that he has lost.

Stronghold is a 2-4 player game telling the story of a siege. Players take opposite sides, one has to defend the stronghold, the other has to break into the castle as soon as possible. As time passes, defenders get Victory Points every turn for their efforts on the walls.
\13\\13\
The game board represents the stronghold itself as well as the surrounding terrain, where enemy forces are placed and from where they proceed to the walls.
\13\\13\
The defender has a small amount of soldiers manning the walls, while the invader has an infinite legion of them! A desperate fight is taking place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them and use black magic rituals to achieve victory. Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.

Stronghold is basically a board game simulation of a video game HUD. Once you get a handle on that concept, the theme just comes pouring through. It's a very tactical game of move and counter-move, with just enough randomness in set up and resource collection to make it almost infinitely re-playable. The learning curve is a little steep, thanks to loads of specialized chits and the rules are a bit of a chore, since each player has their own assymetric set of rules. Once you figure it out though, it's one of the best heavy two player games out there.

A very well-designed 2-player asymmetric game. I think I like playing the defenders better which is perfect because my son likes playing the invaders :)

RATING: 8.8
Siege battle with meaningful decisions regardless of which side you're playing.  A desparate fight to hold out as long as possible.  The bits in the box are OK but I would have rather had larger wooden cubes or plastic minis but I can see how that would have doubled the cost of the game.  It's a Euro style wargame that keeps you moving around your limited resources as both players react to each other's actions.  I find this to be a great game, but I must be honest and state the rules are seriously lacking in quality.  There are a few contradictions and plenty of ommisions that are only clarified in the FAQ.  A v2 of the rules is needed to close all the holes.

High entry threshold because of the complex rules, but once you get past that it's a very enjoyable 2 player game. Thematic eurogame.

Really well done and unique game.  Be aware that it is harder to play as the invader than as the defender.  It is easier to make mistakes as the invader that you won't be able to recover from.

Epic siege warfare tower defense. Waves of monsters lay storm the castle walls defended by the humans and demi-races. The hopelessly outnumbered soldiers hold them off as long as their courage and mettle can stand. Great battle system, and deep strategy, attack and counter, feint and bluff. Deep rich theme.

RATING: 6
Rating based on a closely contested four-player game - won on the tie breaker (although not by my co-defender and me) - that took 5+ hours.

After the game's halfway point, as a member of the defensive team, it seemed that we kept choosing the same actions turn after turn.  My guess is that the attacker's side would be more interesting to play, as there are more meaningful decisions to be made.  That could just be my inexperience talking, however.

Definitely off my buy list, and possibly off my "want to play again" list.  Might be worth trying once more as the attacker, just to see how it feels.

Finally, as I don't want to put anyone off the game solely due to the time factor, I could easily see the game taking half the time (2.5 - 3 hours) with only two players.

RATING: 8
Very interesting game that gives a drastically different feel depending which side you're on.  The invader side is highly-strategic and requires a lot of planning to be successful, while the defender is mostly tactical.

This has one of the best-looking boards I've ever seen.

Best with two players, but works with three or four playing as "teams".

The original version and the Valley Games reprint had some issues with the rules and balance and such, but it sounds like the majority of that is fixed in the upcoming second edition, and an upgrade kit is going to be made available - I'm looking forward to that!



I really need to get this back to the table soon.

Bit of a let down. 
Eurogame abstraction of a siege, with some magic. The rules suck, big time. It's fiddly and definitely too long.
If the stronghold would have as many holes as the rules
there would't be something to get a strong hold on.

Pacing is slow, I don't like that the attacker has to choose his/her cards at the start of the game.
The wooden bits are ok though and I don't miss dice.
I do miss fun though, it's not a bad game just not one
I enjoy that much.

Brisk playing tower defense game.  Excellent integration of the theme.  No down time.  Asymmetric play.  Mechanics are smooth and make sense.  Lots of chances to outguess opponent.  I'm happy with this impulse buy.

First full play was 120 minutes, and we called it after turn 8 with the defender holding an insurmountable lead.  We used the recommended first game cards.  Looking forward to more plays.

Once you can get through the rulebook(s) and play a game to completion the thematic elements of the game shine through the game mechanics.

After one play. Tremendous game. Rating can go only higher.

-- edit --
After three players game - wow. Defender has to be very careful - one mistake and you're out of the game. It's even better with 3. Can't wait to play it with 4.

-- down to 6 --
It's a good game but it's not hitting the table too often. I find it that I rather play some other game than stronghold every time I think anout playing it - I don't know why.

Stronghold is an excellent blend of Ameritrash and Euro games with the rare result of a really cool-themed game with lots of cool actions, but still having many difficult decisions with limited resources.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after a brutal first play.  This is a game you could learn from a friend in maybe 15 minutes, and fumble your way through a little slowly the first time... or both players could learn it from the rulebooks, and you take forever to figure it out.  It's relatively intuitive play that isn't explained so intuitively.

As a game, it's interesting, and has some good mechanisms to give you a definite wargame feel with eurogame-style choices feeding the action.

This game sets the stage for some intense battles.  I enjoy playing as the Invader, continually trying to hone my efficiency and strategy.  Ignacy Trzewiczek is definitely my favorite game designer; I greatly enjoy all of his games.

Oh boy. The rule book from hell. A wonderfully unique game underneath it all but the learning curve is huge. Haven't played for years yet but remember marvelling at it and despising it both at the same time. How do you rate something like this. It could be a 1 or a 10.

Got in many plays, (back on the day - very early '80's), until grape juice was spilled all over it. I went out and got another copy. Sadly I sold these off a few years later. Funny, I don't remember the 'heaviness' of the game, just fond memories. Even if I had a copy (wish I did), it probably wouldn't get played now a days.

Missing some pieces, so currently unplayable--but more than likely I'd only play it over RealmSpeak anyway.

I can actually understand why some people like this, the scope of it is quite grand. But it's not for me. The Third edition plain text rules are written well. It doesn't really make for a strong roleplaying or tactical game experience for me, and although I had a great time learning to understand how to play it, that is in itself not enough to make me play it again. The horror of then trying to teach it to others left me thrashing against the rocks of despair.

RATING: 8.5
This one is full of memories, very complicated but nonetheless fun memories. Don't use the 1st edition rules. Probably THE monster game in my collection, not many games have an 80 page rulebook! My 'rulebook' for the game takes up an entire 1.5" 3-ring binder and includes 4 versions of the rules, many strategy articles, player aides etc. Once you make it past the rules there is a surprisingly deep game here. Despite the appearences this is NOT your standard dungeon crawl/RPG type board game. In all likelyhood this game requires more commitment than most players will ever put into it in order to really see what the game has to offer. Probably not a game that will appeal to a lot of gamers but I sure am glad I own it  and have played it and look forward to playing it in the future. Be sure to check out the new counters that are available. It's a decent amount of work to put together a set of these but it sure does save you from looking up a lot of details in the tables.

An old, plodding, hulk of a game that nothing quite seems to come close to.  It's a brilliant simulationist design, playing through the various minutiae of being an adventurer in a fantasy world.  While the mechanics are somewhat clunky and travel is difficult, there's a feel in the game that almost no other games have managed: the ability to completely micromanage all your needs, the risk of living or dying in one hit, the ability to load up and cast spells with massive effects (Small Blessing, Absorb Essence, a good Fiery Blast) - for all its flaws, the game is phenomenal and incredibly unique.

Years ago- well decades ago I locked myself into my room for about 8 months and played this game front to back with all 16 characters at once.

Most of that rating is just nostalgia.  I bought and sold this game multiple time while in junior high and high school and probably spend more time reading the rules than actually playing the game.  Though I may be the only one to think of it this way, I believe it is a historically important game that provided the conceptual bridge between table top rpgs and computer based rpgs.

Must use 3rd edition rules! Have completed preliminary work on expansion (new tiles, monsters, treasures, missions,etc). This is my favorite game. Endlessly fascinating and re-playable.

A game that can be played solitaire, 2-player and multi-player(up to 16 players!); a game that is co-op and competitive(kill the player that was your staunch ally only last turn and take his stuff); a game where each player has their secret victory conditions; a game of varying player roles-each character having a distinctive set of attributes and special abilities; a game drenched with theme-an immersive fantasy adventure; a game so seamlessly structured as to allow a myriad of expansion material(sadly no official expansions were produced). I could go on...in short, a game ahead of it's time.

Update 2016 -- Been reading the Book of Learning Player Aid. It easily bumps the rating up a point. Since I'm more into solo games, I'm interested in trying this. I've also gotten Realm Speak to practice the rules (since the computer does setup I can just focus on rules).

I must admit, it took intense effort to get into this, but it's surprisingly enjoyable. I probably have a few rules wrong, but this is a fun (if long) game.

It is not as hard as it seems to learn this excellent game that really is not like any other game you have played.  Richard Hamblen is a masterful designer and this is one of his very best games.  Realmspeak makes it much easier to learn and it is very worth the effort and time it takes to learn this game.

As of this writing (3/14/11) I am still learning the game but have mastered enough that I can see the beauty of the design and the depth of gameplay here.

Magic Realm is a grail game for many, and a prized piece in my collection. More importantly, it's also one of the most unique, engaging fantasy adventure games ever made! This game demands a steadfast commitment, as the rule set is unlike anything you're likely to encounter in modern gaming. This effort is part of the experience, however, and Magic Realm has the potential to wholly consume your gaming life for a time. Learning, playing, and mastering the game provides an immersive, memorable experience. It's a game that no tabletop Hall of Fame would be complete without, offering high replayability, and incomparable 1970's fantasy mystique.

I have the earliest version of this cult game with the "lawyer spaghetti" rules.

I find the constant logging of moves and the often used technique of looting and then running away; returning, looting and then running away; etc.  a little too repetitive.

Should drag it out sometime and have another try, as my memories of the game are 10-15 years old.

THE WORST. I'd rate it lower, but the sheer force of will by gamers has made this into a "game". I pity anyone who played any roleplaying table top games and subjects themselves to this.

You write down your moves in advance. You make a few D6 rolls. Sometimes you're lucky and you'll get a chance to make more D6 rolls to get loot. The battle system is probably the best part, but is clunky and boring. 

Owning this game was a curse and I'm glad I ebayed it.

Magic Realm is one of those games I won't let go.  I was cursed to have a 1st. edition copy and I figured if I can play ASL I can figure this out.  It took me longer, but I did and was able to teach the game.  Our group likes it and we pull it out from time to time, now that I have later rules editoins and things are clearer.  Diceless combat, must make good decisions, somethings you can't avoid, pays to work in groups.  This is a good multiplayer team game.  With the number of players types and random map, replay value is huge.  We have a blast with it. I think most low scores are due to the ungodly complexity of figuring out the rules.  If you can find a group that already plays, try it!!!!!

Magic Realm is little more than any of the other games of the genre where you move your guy from here to there, roll to see if he runs into a monster, roll to see if the monster kills him, roll to see if he finds any treasure...in short: roll dice and watch what happens. In my single playing I made no meaningful choices. In fact, the only actual choices I made involved where to move. Once I moved someplace the dice took over. For all of this you have a rulebook that is hailed far and wide as the one of the worst ever written. The content of the game is far outweighed by the complexity of the rules. This game's only saving grace is that my friends adore it (for some unfathomable reason) so a day spent mired in it's messiness isn't a total wash...I can tease my buds.

Thusfar I'm not impressed by this game.  We have learned movement & battles.  Seems too easy to get killed in P-vs-P combat.  Secret passages/trails are nearly impossible to find and caves & mountains really slow you down.  Getting "blocked" stinks (totally ends movement) so do a "hide" action before moving... that said, having to burn an action for hiding during almost every turn seems lame (especially for the short-legged dwarf who only gets 2 actions instead of 4 per turn).

This is the best depiction of a pencil and paper RPG experience in a board game format that I've yet seen. It takes dedication and patience to play well and a group willing to invest the time required to fully explore everything this game offers - but it is highly worth the effort! This game cries out to be revamped and re-issued with modern components. Forget Runebound, DungeonQuest and all the pale imitations - this was and still is The One!

For those who love the game and want to play you can't go wrong with RealmSpeak where you can play on-line or even solo! You need to know a fair bit about the game to enjoy RealmSpeak, but it is the total answer for those who want the experience but can't find a group willing to learn it.

What a game!  So much depth and replay value in a 30 year old design.  The learning curve is rough but I found the 3rd edition rules and the stategy articles posted by Stephen McKnight very helpful.

One other note is that Realmspeak makes playing/learning the game tons easier.  Not only does it help with mechanics the time is saves with setting up is huge.  Every MR fan should give it a look:

Now this game is complicated.  It takes three years to set up and nine years to play, so you'd best have a table set aside for the rest of perpetuity, if you want to ever play this game.  On the other hand, the scale and flexibility are tremendous.  (Or should that be Tremendous**?)  There's even one character option, the Witch King, who can't even move or pick up treasure without having to cast spells -- now that's complex!  Cool game though.

Once again must get credit for being one the pioneering fantasy games.

Nonetheless not the sort of game I was passionate about, extremely complicated, detailed, difficult rulebook etc. so would not recommend now other than for nostalgic reasons.

I played this again recently, and I really think the 3rd Edition rules are bonkers - too complicated and way too long for any gamer who isn't hard-core into the game. My rating is actually for 1st Edition.

If you're interested in this game - and it is a pretty cool game - start by using the 1st edition rules and start playing with only the encounters through monsters. Don't use Spells or Natives. Crucially, use the 1st Edition victory conditions (first to complete their objectives just wins). If you like it, move on to add Spells. Then, quite honestly, you can be done adding rules. Natives add a huge amount of both rules and rules grit and while they also add some interesting and subtle strategies, the game doesn't need them to be interesting and fun. If you're not hard core, the 1st Edition game with the encounters through Spells is of totally reasonable complexity and can be played in a few hours (3-ish). The 1st Edition rules are not perfect for sure, but they're more than good enough for people of goodwill.

The 3rd Edition rules are a huge problem for the game on a few levels. Firstly, they lack the modularity of the AH version, so you can't learn the game's complexities stepwise, and you can't select a level of complexity you like. Secondly, they are poorly laid out and very badly written and almost impossible to understand for large chunks if you don't already know what they say; the AH rules were not perfect but they were clear and well laid-out. Thirdly, they force you to play a whole month - 8 hours - which is just a bonkers time commitment for this game which rationally should be over in 2-3 weeks and 3-4 hours (the last week is rarely useful to play, in that all the main things to be done have been done and you're just scrounging for points). I get why they did this; characters with significant ramp-up time (Witch-King, Magician) have a hard time competing with the White Knight and Berserker just because the latter can get to their victory conditions so quickly. Making the game longer, though, doesn't *really* help that much. If you want to make the game a little longer to give the complex characters a little more play, just allocate one or two more points.

So: if you're new, stick with the 1st Edition rules until you've verified that you need the 3rd. Stick with the first few encounters. Recognize that Magic Realm is a game of alliances, teamwork, and dealmaking; characters who work together do vastly better than loners (for the most part) so it's really about making deals to form efficient teams. Then figure out if you like the game and are going to be one of those hard-core fans who goes all-in. Most people won't be, but still definitely *can* enjoy a more sensible configuration.

This is an amazing game, one with both tremendous tactical and strategic depth that also incredibly successfully carries the fantasy theme. It is also, sadly, a throwback to the days when time was cheap and good games were few (even given that the rules complexity issues are, I believe, somewhat overstated). The amount of time and effort that this game consumes, and the number of times you have to play to really experience the depth of experience it conveys, is really beyond what we've come to live with for games today. While nothing has even come close to challenging Magic Realm in the fantasy boardgame arena, that's not to say it's going to get played alot anymore.

A friend and I spent a weekend playing this and poring over the various rulebooks.  I'm still not sure we ever actually played combat correctly.  An incredibly complex game and I may never play it again, but so brilliant that I can't give it up.  To my mind the best board game implementation of an RPG.

Back in 1992, my girlfriend at the time convinced me to play this with her. She couldn't remember all the rules, since nobody but her dad and brother had ever agreed to play... Anyway, we went ahead with the setup and read the rules as we went. Now, it's been nearly 14 years since we started playing and I haven't seen this particular girlfriend in about six or seven years now, but as far as I know, that game is still set up and still in progress. It quietly waits for one of us to confirm the rules.

As of this writing I only have one play of my physical copy and many plays on RealmSpeak. This is a tough game. As many comments have said, early on you will die. A lot. The game hates you. That is part of the challenge; just getting through the 28 days/turns feels like a big accomplishment. Getting to positive VPs is cause for celebration.

Once you get over the hump of the extensive rules--which the 3rd edition fan rewrite and additional tutorial document is a huge help--you will see the elegance of many of the systems and the incredible built-in flexibility of the game. it seems Hamblen has anticipated nearly all of a player's gambits and has an answer built in to the game.

It's a long play, and setup can be fiddly. But if you're up to getting over the learning curve and the setup time, it's worth it.

RATING: 10
I could see myself (eventually) really liking this game.  But wow is that rulebook difficult to parse - with the aid of the third edition rulebook here on the geek the game is perhaps playable with some dedication.  I love fantasy and wargames - so this seems like it could be everything I want in a deep fantasy simulation.  I will put out the effort to learn this guy, but it sure seems like a process.  We'll see if it's worth it.

UPDATE: Well, I spent the better part of a winter playing through the computer version, along with poring over the rules and watching the instructional videos of people playing, and I think I understand the rules.  It's at the border of being something that's just too much to handle, but it does lend itself to some amazing narratives for a boardgame that really have no parallel in any fantasy boardgame I can think of.  I could see this game going in waves in terms of playings, as it isn't always easy to find people willing to play, but I can't see myself ever turning down a game if the right group comes along.  This game is so unique for a fantasy boardgame, with so many intricate interacting pieces, that it's like watching a little universe grow before your eyes.

RATING: 9
It's really complex (at least until you do not play enough games). I've got first edition of the game and I did not enjoy it until I found 3rd edition rules: they are highly recommended for their clarity and completeness. They are 122 pages long... And, even with so many rule pages, it's fun!

Just surviving is hard. It lends itself to different gaming approaches: you can play it competitively or cooperatively. Every time the mapboard is different. You can play solo. You can set victory conditions for a really long game or, just, for a shorter one. You can even play with a given time set to finish.

It's really difficult to explain this wonderful mix of details, flexibility, strategic and tactical components.  You could think it's mostly random, say combat resolution, and instead it is not: you can make a whole lot of tactical mistakes; most of the times you lose a combat - and your character - you should have avoided it in the first place. The initial character choice must be paired with a line of development (where to go, which natives to meet, which places to visit - and maybe to enchant -, which victory conditions to set...).

Hard to find a game as multifaceted and deep as this one!

Magic Realm is a game I respect more than I actually enjoy playing. It is complex, but the system actually works very well. And there is a lot of flexibility, replayability and fun moments. The game generates a wonderful narrative. That's probably what I like most.

But as I play, I wonder why I'm not either playing Dungeons and Dragons RPG or a computer game. I think Magic Realm is a good example of a game that truly has been obsoleted to some degree by computers. The book-keeping is just beyond what's reasonable for a boardgame these days. 

Shoot, even big Magic Realm fans seem to be recommending to play it with realmspeak online. That says a lot. 

I don't expect to have many opportunities to play this one, but I would enjoy doing so periodically. I doubt I'd play enough to really get the rules down well enough to play at a high level. Its more for the immersion of it all. 

I find myself wanting to choose actions for my guy that may not be the smartest thing, but are more in line with how I want to play my character, like and RPG. Its hard for me to separate that and try to play more cut-throat and intelligently.

I've given this game the benefit of the doubt for a number of years but I've come off the fence.

Downsides:
Set up time - serious issue
Card Quality - can live with
Difficult Rules - very serious issue
Un-winable situations and player elimination - serious issue

Upsides:
Lots of replay potential - biggest plus
Tactical combat with Euro like levels of luck - ahead of its time

I'm a wargammer of long standing and have played a few games at the highest complexity without major issues.  Unfortunately this game defeats me.  I think there are different types of complexity and this has the type I struggle with.

Mage Knight is the only modern game I think off that matches this game in any way.  It puts a nail in this games coffin as far as I'm concerned.  I look at the two games on my shelf and only one of them will end up on the table.

So you've read all the reviews, comments, and criticisms here about Magic Realm's complexity, its terrible rulebook, and overall opaque inaccessibility.  You've heard the rumours and legends about folks trying to "get it" but failing, with their copies winding up sold, traded, ebayed, or even thrown away.  You're nervous about the game-maybe even scared by it- yet obviously you're curious if you're reading this comment.  I'll tell you this much- Magic Realm _is_ complex, it _is_ inaccessible...but it's also one of the greatest games ever published, a game that truly rewards the effort and patience it takes to learn the subtleties and intricacies of a system that is far and away the most complete and comprehensive "RPG on a board" created to date.  The level of detail and atmosphere goes far beyond Talisman, Runebound, or any games  in its class and as a result it emerges as a much more interesting, compelling, and fun game with some really amazing systems that while not necessarily intuitive are logical, realistic, and rich with strategic possibilities.  The tactical, blow-by-blow combat system in particular is absolutely genius and much like Mr. Hamblen's Gunslinger each combat provides a rich, detailed narrative of the events that transpire.  Rules for natives (with varying dispositions based on your character), different types of magic, treasures, exploring, quests, and pretty much anything else you want to do in a fantasy game are here so don't expect a dice-rolling contest with a map like World of Warcraft or a simplified pick-up-and-deliver game like Return of the Heroes (which I love, BTW).            There's just really nothing else quite like it.  The game can be extremely intimidating (even the setup is something of an ordeal the first couple of times) but I can't stress enough that the payoff is worth it as it offers an experience that modern games just simply can't match with their abstractions and simplifications- and that in a reasonable amount of time (definitely a single evening game).  I highly recommend Realmspeak, a Java application that, if used in concert with Joel Yoder's "Magic Realm in Plain English" rules set and the more "classically" formatted 3rd edition riles, makes learning the game a hundred times easier than simply opening the rule book and reading straight through.  There are reasons this game is still passionately loved by some and passionately hated by others and I believe that if you take the time to come to terms with the game's terribly presented yet beautiful rules (which were, IMHO, way ahead of its time)then you'll find it hard not to love it.  Or, you can just throw your hands up in the air like many people do and be satisfied with Runebound.    A real masterpiece that is likely as close to a piece of literature that a board game can get- epic, difficult, rich, polarizing, dense, and thoroughly engrossing.

This game is truly magnificent. Top of my list. Complex, but it has everything you could ever dream in Fantasy adventure boardgame. A holy grail, that no boardgame could ever replace since 1979! 

Beware of the intimidating rules. Learning this by your own is a pain. It's easier if someone teach you, but learning by yourself is long hard road ahead.

And it's totally worth the pain, believe me. Legendary Treasure inside! A list you could do here:

- Different Character to play (with VERY different playstyle)
- 1 to 16 players without ANY rule changes whatsoever. No change to setup, no special rules.
- Players can join and quit the game anytime, without breaking the game. 
- Can play cooperative, competitive, or semi and backstab, without any additional rules. The game really made to encompass all of it in balance
- Superb mechanics about damage and vulnerability (and weight)
- Non HP character, and you get weaker when wounded (or fatiqued). 
- Controlled Luck
- Great mechanics of combat which really simulates dungeon crawl combat.
- Wide array of treasures and magic. And the differences is NEVER by stat number. Every treasures and magic has DIFFERENT effect.
- Randomized setup for limitless replayability
- Great mechanic on encounter/monsters. Still random, but you know what to expect. 
- Many victory conditions, combined with variable character, make the gameplay rich.
- Horse to use as mule or stead.
- Interactive NPC (can trade, fight, or even HIRE)
- Everything is possible! Improbable maybe, but never impossible. 
- Unique way to cast magic and handle the cost.
- Can incite war to different faction of NPCs
- Optional rules for weather and level up.

So really, is there any element on fantasy adventure that is NOT in Magic Realm?

The strongest point for this game: There are so many ways to play and win: Be a bad or a good guy! Be a warrior or a mage! Be a solo or teamplayer! Trade or Steal! Hunt down monsters or other players!.....If you finally love the game you wish a session would last longer.

RATING: N/A
Not terribly as exiting as I hoped.  Too much downtime between turns (especially during combat), and the dice rolling was excessive.  Roll to hide, roll to fight, roll to search for treasure, roll to gain followers, roll to...  I was a white knight with a great sword and armor, and I died fighting bats!
We didn't play where you had to plan your move in advance, but I can't see that making the game better, only harder.
We didn't even do much in the way of Magic, but just the combat system itself seemed way more complicated than it should be.  
I'm not really interested in playing this one again, although I do respect the game and I understand the value it has for others.  I'd be willing to try this again but only solo, and I can even expect it would be fun.

Update: Years later and now I'm VERY interested in learning this game and exploring it in depth. I am confident my first play was spoiled by too many new players (me included!). As with most games I enjoy, the first play is far from ideal, and this game seems to reward extensive study and exploration. And it doesn't have any stupid minis!

RATING: 10
Magic Realm doesn't care about balanced character types, it doesn't worry much about simple, easy-to-learn rules, it is in many ways the polar opposite of high-design (German-style) games like Agricola or Carcassonne.  However, after wading through the chest deep mire that is the 3rd edition rulebook and finding similarly determined players, this game takes on a life of its own.  

Emergent gameplay is a buzzword tossed around by game developers today and this game, published over 30 years ago, has it in spades.  No game will play out the same way twice, especially when played, as it should be, with other people.

An example: in a tournament game the Witch and myself as the Captain were preparing for a confrontation with the Amazon and Sorceror who seemed to be safely out of range; however, the Sorceror transformed a dragon under his control into a frog and followed it through the woods in order to block us.  Then he applied ointment of steel to his skin and set his hirelings against his own frog in order to kill it in Round 1 so he could free up the Transform spell and redirect it against the Witch (who had absorbed a dragon of her own) on Round 2 before she could bite his head off.  Fortunately for us, we had an Amulet which we used to dispell the Transform spell and revert the Witch into a dragon.

Only in Magic Realm will you find a sequence of events like this in a board game.  Even today's Role Playing Games, compare D&D 4th edition spells with those from earlier versions, have given up imaginative problem solving in favor of increased focus on balance and control. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating after 1 play. Dungeons & Dragons done as a board game. The combat system and spells are interesting, and you get to run around killing monsters (or run from them), collect fame, notoriety, spells or money.

The length of play is a bit much for me, though I can see that improving dramatically with experience. Some of the characters are clearly more powerful than others, but I doubt I would want to play a game where character-killing is allowed, so that's a bit of a dilemma.

Decent on the whole but I suspect games like [i]Ravenloft[/i], among others, now satisfy the "dungeon crawl as a board game" itch at a fraction of the complexity.

THE BEST FANTASY PSEUDO ROLE-PLAYING BOARD GAME EVER.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I purchased the original Magic Realm in 1978, and it took me a couple of years, accompanied by a significant expansion to my Frontal Lobe, to grasp the rules. By the time I was 16 or so, I was able to play the game without too much anxiety. I wrote Richard Hamblen about certain confusing rules, mostly regarding Natives, and he replied quickly in a bright, red pen. Since then, I have lost that edition and have purchased the second. I noticed a couple of changes or clarifications that were made were what I questioned Richard about, and am hopefully thinking that in some roundabout way, I helped with the rules...not that it mattered. The second edition rules can be just as confusing. Why? Because the game is complicated!BTW, when learning the first edition rules, I believe I counted approximately 750 rules, up to the "THAT'S ALL FOLKS!" ending (which I thought was brilliant and funny). Since then, there have been even more additions...Also, the game is cumbersome and takes forever to set up. I crafted little cardboard "wall" to surround most of the boxes on the Set Up card, because one little bump, and the whole thing became a mess. The walls helped, but still, the set-up was extremely long, and somewhat tedious.In sum:1) The game is complicated2) The set-up is loooong.After reading the negative reviews on the game, I noticed these were the most frequently cited issues players had. However, I knew that when I bought the game. I knew that when I was 14 years old. AH rated it a 9 out of 10 in difficulty at the time. It was on the box.Given this, I must say Magic Realm is undoubtedly the best fantasy board game ever created. It truly is unparalled in terms of depth, possibilities,  imagination, re-playability, look and feel. It can be played solo or with a bunch of people. You can use your imagination (and oftentimes common sense!) to interpret rules on your own, change victory conditions, or make the Campaigns more like tactical warfare. Sure, it takes effort, but what good things don't? I remember enchanting my first tile to this day. The entire look of the board changed. It was truly magical.If your looking for the "Real Deal", look no further, because Magic Realm is as good as it gets (though, it could be re-released with some tweaks...). If you want Magic Realm Lite, then you can check out the beer and pretzel games like Talisman (which I liked as well, but not for the same reasons). It's a sophisticated game, for sophisticated players.SO, try it out if you get the chance. The rulebook is actually quite interesting to read, even if you don't play it. And remember: There really are only 4 phases (usually), and generally you'll just move, hide and search. Don't be intimidated by the more complex stuff. I think there is more common sense in this game than most people realize...I mean, if a tremendous monster hits when red-side down, it does little damage because it has simply picked up the character and is proceeding to tear him apart!

RATING: 6.5
Combat with hirelings. Well, that's the barrier that usually cures us of this game. Other than that, there's a lot to love in the game. Just exploring is fun.

Solitaire is fun. Just don't use hirelings.

RATING: 7
The game itself is interesting, if fairly chaotic.  The ability to upgrade your character depends almost entirely on spells you find and equipment you pick up, which is unfortuantely.  The game also takes a ding as the endgame loses steam when there's nothing interesting left to explore.

Having owned the game for longer than I wish to admit and having only tried it once or twice during all those years (not very successfully I might add) I finally sat down and went through some of the excellent guides available here on BGG.

The game IS amazing and still manages to feel fresh and interesting after all these years. While still somewhat rules heavy it's actually quite logical and easy to play with the updated rulebook and player aids. I'm certain I could teach this game quite fast and easily now which was not possible with older iterations of the rules.

I'm not saying I'm playing well but I'm having loads of fun with RealmSpeak. Go try it out yourself!

RATING: 9
Wow.  What an incredible, unique, immersive game.  The game is simple in its implementation, but complicated to understand all the minutia.  I would rate it a 10 if there was some way to keep all the goodness in a way that is easier to explain and reference.  I have become completely addicted to this game from the past...especially with its online version RealmSpeak.

RATING: 7
Players take a character and enter a fantasy realm, questing to achieve their victory conditions.  Players play out turns of six phases - moves for the "day" are pre-recorded, monsters prowl via a die roll, the moves are played out, combat potentially takes place, and it's all tidied up for the next day.  Victory is achieved by fulfilling your preset targets - treasure, fame, gold, etc. - and it's not easy to achieve.  Famous game for it's hard to penetrate rules, but thanks to the efforts of some people (authors of MRIPE and RealmSpeak), I'm actually beginning to play this game... and I'm enjoying it.  Deep and fascinating.

RATING: 9
Magic Realm is legendary for many reasons. It is hard to play because of the notoriously technical rulebook and obscenely long sessions. However, Magic Realm delivers on its promise of a fantasy dungeon-crawl. It has an incredible variety of strategies, subtleties, and amazing details. The characters appear to be generic at first, but all of them are wildly different and each plays divergent styles.
 
I'll admit that some of the complexity doesn't seem to have big payoffs: the resolution system and procedures for determining which denizen attacks which hireling can drive a man to madness. Yet most of the complexity is absolutely needed to make the engine run. What other games let you send out a hired rogue to lure away a tremendous serpent solely so that he'll get eaten? And ever more importantly, what other fantasy game makes said serpent more vulnerable when he goes in for the kill, affording you a chance to strike it dead? Bring in the genious that is Richard Hamblen! 
 
Also I have to mention that I would never have discovered this classic beauty without the amazing new computer version called Realmspeak. Realmspeak makes the daunting task of learning this much easier because it enforces all of the rules. And there's no better way to learn that spells only happen during encounter than to forget just once. Just as important is the fact that Realmspeak runs combats, tracks who is on whose cards, and sets up the entire game in a matter of seconds. Hence it is the only way to play for most of us outside of a convention setting. I cannot recommend it enough!

The best fantasy realm ever created in a board game! Sure, the rules are long and complicated (and I'm not sure that I ever get them all right...), but this game has held my interest since it was new (way back in '79!) when my older brother brought it home (my sister still mentions "that game you guys used to play, the one with the hexes"). A true classic!

Purchased as "complete and used player's copy".  It looks complete but I have not counted the counters.

The game looks like it was owned by someone who played it and loved it. The counters are all separated out and bagged. The bags are labeled with marker indicating their type. All of the terrain boards are clean and look great. The previous owner even kept the counter punch-outs so it might be possible to compare them to the bagged counters. I bought it on eBay for $75 or so which at the time was the low-end of the scale for a complete copy.

There is one hand-made character card for the Amazons. It is really well-made with glue and cardboard using print copy and colors that fit the other cards.  My bet is it was from BGG but I don't know if it is an addition or replacement. All the art on the character cards is awesome and clean. The box is in predictable shape. It has many repairs on the corners but the good news is that it is structurally sound and the top with the art is clean and bright. 

If you are on the fence, I can provide you with some pics. In that case please provide an alternate email address so I can attach them easily.

RATING: 10
This is a beautiful game - if one could fall in love with a game design, this would be the woman of your dreams. Contrary to common belief this is not an "exception-happy" rulesbook (like ASL) - all rules are logical and fit well into the general context. Sometimes you can even guess them correctly, if you're into the flow of it!
It is THE fantasy board game. Richard Hamblen has taken immense care to create a logical and totally underivative world (the realm has it's own "classical" fantasy flair, perhaps comparable to the "Sorcerer's Cave" games). If you get beyond the threat of the rulebook (take it bit by bit, as recommended), and you will be rewarded, I promise. And if everybody knows the rules, it actually IS a quick game (if you play the basic one month - game). Not 1 hour, though, I'd say about 3. Follow the links on this page - there are many wondrous expansion done by fans of the game. The fact alone that there still ARE fans should tell you how good this game is...

Sadly, pretty much unplayable. Some great mechanics, but just too fiddily to play F2F and the combat takes forever. Realmspeak is pretty good though. I'd give it a 3, but i'll make it a 4 b/c of realmspeak.  Needs to be remade.  There's a good game in there somewhere.

No one younger than me is going to be interested in this game. There is a very good downloadable version, and that was the most fun I've ever had with this game. The actual old board game takes way to long to set up, and it's far too likely that a player will be eliminated in an early round even with good play. This is a good Classic game, but it never got much traction... for good reasons.

Lucky owner of the 2nd edition components and rules.  Probably the closest thing to a D&D style RPG that I have found in a board game, especially in terms of complexity.

Highly recommend using the Book of Learning and Java-based Realmspeak to teach you the rules a bit at a time.

It's interesting to see all the nice things people write about this game... but "back in the day" (i.e. - when I was playing AH wargames all the time, including 1st ed. 3rd Reich & SL, as well as DMing D&D), the rules to Magic Realm were darn near impenetrable.

This game is like a physics formula that you can't quite solve, no one will play this with me and I don't want to teach anyone else how to play.  I find more and more I like about this game on every play.  The options are endless and the Magic Realm really feels alive.  There are only a few weapons and monsters but those there are enough!  Unlike silly games like runebound, more is NOT needed, what is available is deep and more than enough.  It is one of the hardest game I own but the most satisfying.  The difficultly no longer is because of a poorly written rulebook with the updated V3.2 rule book the examples are clear and rules easily understood.  The game is difficult not to learn but to master!

It may be just the best board game ever made.

More:

This is the "Lord of the Ring" of the boardgaming world!  A work of genius at its heights.  So strategic yet subtle, every variable meaningful and account for some strategy.  Every character class so vastly different, it seems like its totally another game.  A boardgaming wonder often misunderstood and too complicated for most casual gamers, but once learnt there are no substitute, its the most unique gaming experience and rivals even ASL in its attention to detail and mystique.

Devastatingly creative.  This has become one of my tens and I hope to soon make the Carthaginian remake.  It is a crime that Hamblen has not expanded the game with his personal expansions.

This game is incredibly tricky and difficult to learn but totally rewarding.  I respect everyone's reason for not picking the game up but they are doing themselves a disservice.  Certainly the finest fantasy game ever made---people put this in the same category as Runebound or other fantasy adventure games but no game does all the things Magic Realm does.  In truth it is in a category of its own.  The reason it's so hard is because it's so original.  Hamblen approached every question of design in this fantasy game with no reference to anyone else's fantasy game.  A true original.

See my review.

Update:  Had to knock this down from 10.  It requires a dedicated group to play and I just don't have the energy or horsepower to do it myself solo.  It's still one of the greatest, most original designs ever.  Unsurprisingly, my plays are with the Magic Realm java program.

Certain things in this game make sense and other things I still can't wrap my head around.  Combat especially when it involves multiples characters or critters is daunting to say the least, and the game comes to a dead stop while that is being resolved.

Avalon Hill was an amazing game company - all of the ones I've played ( Dune, Third Reich, a few others ) had exceptional game logic producing new gaming experiences every time you played. Magic Realm was my favorite. True, there are a couple of rules ( just 2 or 3 ) that require some interpretation/home rule to address ( e.g. the Crystal Ball allowing a spell caster to spell any hex is a game ending item - just sit back and fry your opponent with abandon ). But these small caveats don't deter my 10 rating. One of the best games I've ever played. It takes time to learn, AH giving it a complexity rating of 10 ( only 2 other of their games earned this designation: Third Reich and Squad Leader ). But, oh boy, is it worth it. Once you get your sea legs with this thing, every aspect of it is a blast. Even setting it up is fun ( takes at least an hour, LOL! ). Not many games with 0 learning curve are worth the trouble, so if you want something that yields endless variation, fun content, worthwhile challenge and surprise ( all the ingredients for maximum fun ), then you have to spend some time to learn how to play. Just remember, this game doesn't "stay" complicated - nicely designed that you don't have to keep referencing the manual to play once you get it.

Probably the most difficult game to get other people to play with you on.  Hard enough getting 1 person to discover and enjoy this game on their own.  Normally an 8.0 rating if you play solo, but start playing with other players and that easily boosts the rating to a 9.0 game.  Highly recommended, if you can learn how to play (don't underestimate the difficulty of the rules, it's been known to drive university professors mad).

RATING: 5
This is what happens when Avalon Hill sets out to reinvent Dungeons & Dragons when D&D was at it's most opaque and cranky state, and Avalon Hill's ethos was dominated by ridiculous complexity for it's own sake. Magic Realm isn't as impossible as some would have you believe, but neither is it as good as most of the breathless praise would indicate. Even with all the excellent re-written rules and video tutorials supporting this game, Magic Realm is still an ordeal to learn. After hearing for years that Magic Realm was the pinnacle of this genre, I was disappointed in the game. Yes, it is a better game than Runebound, Talisman, and Return of the Heroes ... but those other games offer 70% of the experience of Magic Realm for about 20% of the effort. I'm sorry, guys, but the view from the mountaintop just isn't worth the climb. I enjoy a solo game every now and then with Realmspeak, but the board game experience is too fiddly and needlessly complicated for my tastes.

RATING: 9.5
I love the Realm. Rediscovering it when cleaning out a cupboard led me back into boardgaming. I'd never even think about starting into a game with this complexity and fantasy theme now but fortunately I played it avidly when I was a teenager with plenty of patience and free time to spare so getting back on the warhorse was no problem. It might be a huge, flawed dinosaur of a game but I don't care. Majestic in scope, detailed, rich, evocative, ingenious in parts, exciting and endlessly replayable, multiplayer or solo, it will always be my favourite. Getting it on the table is difficult at this point in my life but with the amazing Realmspeak I know I always have easy solo play at my fingertips.

RATING: 3
I like the theme (2 points), and the scope (1 point), but after getting it (i love talisman, Runebound etc), i found that even to my very statistical/analytical brain (i'm a games coder/designer) it was nigh on impossible to figure out the rules. I therefore have traded it on, never to go near again.

This is game was a lifelong quest for me: I bought it at the tender age of 17. The board, the characters, the theme hooked me like nothing else, more so than even Talisman or Dungeon! ever did. It took me decades, however, to finally penetrate the ruleset and understand how to play it (I credit Realmspeak and the 3rd edition rules for that, btw).

The game is a wonder, so intricate and detailed, yet still epic. It has the depth of a novel, the thrill of a movie (especially the blow-by-blow combat), and the suspense of theater as you watch your allies decide whether they'll turn their blades on you.

The map is built, then your character(s) explore each map hex, looking for treasure and monsters that you can kill. Monsters are sometimes guarding specific sites, but you may also blunder into them if they decided to go hunting for man-flesh that day. You will day, more often than not, until you learn the ropes. To help, you can hire natives, or trade with them for weapons, gold, etc. Some of your hired natives can even become leaders themselves, commanding other natives. Build your own private army!

The magic system is unique: you have to “prepare the air” first by finding or providing magic of a certain color, then play an action to actually cast the spell. This step of enchanting your location in preparation for a spell can be done on different scales: in the entire hex, in your clearing, or just for you alone. Picture yourself on the eve of a big fight standing on a mountain top, gathering a storm down in a whirlwind of magic that you’ll use later to blast those two flying dragons into oblivion…

All of this comes together to deliver a rich, complex experience. The learning curve is tremendous, hence the non-10 rating. It’s worth the effort, though. Precious few games can support 1-6+ players while still providing a riveting experience where you can work together, kill each other off, or do something in between. This is probably my favorite game of all time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Set up is a pain.  The game doesn't come together until all of the rules are used (rules are broken down into sections).  The game has the worst combat system I have ever seen: slow, cumbersome, predictable and often lopsided. The theme is a great, but the flaws are just too numerous.  I truely wanted to like the game but can't.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I love the game board, the intricate setup, the idea of planning ahead heroes' moves, the promise of possibilities.

Sadly, the ratio of time invested (setup, planning and looking up rules) and actual gameplay (making moves, plain DOING something and observing its effect and getting a laugh or a frown out of it) is way, WAY in favour of time investment. On top of that, many of the rules that deliver some gameplay "payoff" feel utterly contrived and unsatisfying in the sense of how the mechanics model the ongoings in the game world.

Playing this game feels like running those very early computer roleplaying games (Ultima, Bard's Tale) - but not as the player who just hits the keys and watches things unfold, but as the computer who has to do the work of keeping track of one's markers, constantly looking up the rules, and occasionally updating the game board. Admittedly, ALL games have that aspect to them, but most other games have the additional factor of dynamics, player interaction, joy, exhileration... plain fun. This game's motto might be "much ado about nothing".

If this were the only board game of with a RPG/fantasy theme in the world (as it might have been in 1979), I'd probably put a lot of effort into unfolding its potential. Fortunately, it is not (anymore). 

Having delivered my criticism, I respect all the people who rate this game as 10, and I can understand why they do it.

This was the first game I ever mail ordered or pre-ordered (in 1978).  I love AH games but this game (in its first edition) was enough to put me off all board games for years.

I 'hear' they fixed the "rules issues" from the first edition but that will never get me my lost WEEKS of trying (without luck) to make the game work...  Nor will it repair my shattered hopes of ever seeing a good Fantasy Board game.

Game gets 2 points only based on the quality of the components and the fact it was a AH game.

All the rumours are true. The rules system is a lot to grapple with; though to be frank no individual thing is very hard to grasp--and working things through with the components makes some things (deployment, chit setup, etc) vastly easier.
The game has narrative, though. I don't know how or why it accomplishes it, to be honest, but games like Magic Realm are the games that FFG should produce but can't seem to be able to. A game of Magic Realm is a story, despite the absence of flavour text and the antiquated graphic design. For that alone, Magic Realm stands as a monument to brilliant game design.

You have to see this as what it is.. a piece of game history.
Would i play it for fun? No, never.
Am i facinated by it as a predecessor to modern gaming & early computer adventures? Yes, definately!

Except for the deck-building it shares many similiarities with Mage Knight by Vlaada Chvatil. But they went for a much broader & open sand-box style. That sand-box attempt comes with a rule book of 120 pages and a second highest complexity rating by it's publisher Avalon Hill.

I highly recommend trying it out, in the same way you should play a sierra adventura on the computer to see the base structure behind all dem new & shiny titles.

A game way ahead of its time, today it feels pretty dated in some ways, like its huge setup time. That said, it has a very rich theme, and many of its mechanics are unparalleled in its genre.

Realmspeak makes all of the game's disadvantages irrelevant, allowing for solo games in under half an hour, with all the rich strategy and theme but without any bookkeeping. 

Would anyone even want to play Runebound or World of Warcraft in computerized form?

I've owned this since the first edition was released in the late seventies. I've read all the complaints about the rules being too hard to understand, and the setup time being too long, but I don't agree. I understood the first edition rules in 1977 and I understand them today. And personally, I LIKE setting up the game. But I've never liked the map (too abstract), the characters (too generic--"Elf," "Dwarf," etc.), or the artwork (ugh). The combat and magic systems are nicely done, but I just can't seem to get drawn in to the stories that this game supposedly tells so well. Ho-hum.

RATING: 9
Rating will probably keep rising as I understand more about how this complex system works.  Has the potential to be my favorite game ever.

Some of the battles, once solved, are a little boring.  (Wait to match directions with the Troll as the invulnerable Rogue lures it, covered by my trusty axe.  Roll dice to decide how many chits I need to fatigue to keep the battle going long enough to kill it.  Yawn.)  Still, the game as a whole is amazingly engaging.  I need to buckle down and learn how the magic system works, but I seem to be getting caught in Realmspeak's very strict sequencing.  That means I should probably start playing magic users in real life to understand the phasing better, but I can't just fire up a real-life game with more than 1 person on a whim, unfortunately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'm really looking forward to exploring this system more and I'm at a horrible loss in how to rate this beast. 

I have not found the rules to be overly complex, just a lot of them compared to Attika or Samurai say; I grew up playing Avalon Hill games and I appear to still be used to the way they laid out rules.   

I got "Magic Realm" to see the system and was thrilled to discover Richard Hamblen's Magnum Opus. There was a lot of thought and hard work put into this one. I think it meant a lot to him and it's beginning to mean a lot to me. It's not leaving my hands if I can help it.

On an aside: 
In my mind, "Return of the Heroes" was clearly inspired by this one (and that's not a knock in anyway against "Return of the Heroes", it's a plus). "Heroes" is simpler in rules and great fun and may have a wider appeal now-a-days, the "Realm" seems to have been made for....man...love of epic fantasy and completeness.

Long, complex--by today's standards for sure--but a true labor of love that is almost infinetly replayable.

It has a solo option and it's open ended. Fantastic for what it was, but learning as a modern player may seem like too much work for you.

A CLASSIC! in every way, but in no way for everyone.

Be warned, you'll like it or give up on it. If at all possible, learn from somebody who knows. It's a great game when you get to 'knowing' it. 

Just decide if you're willing to try.

I studied the rules to Magic Realm for a month before playing, as I wanted to play with the full ruleset out of the gate. It was a success and we all had a great time, although combat still confuses us a bit with some of the details. 

I love the variety, the true feeling of exploration, the push your luck elements of searching, and the sense of story that unfolds. I dislike the combat, although not quite enough to ruin the game for me. For all of the complexity in the combat system, your choices wind up being very similar for every fight. The complexity is needless.

Realmspeak is a fantastic thing, by the way!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after two plays (12 hours). This is a very difficult game for me to rate. 

To play Magic Realm is to discover some lost and exotic alternative to the stale fantasy conventions of today. In place of "hit points," the game offers four levels of vulnerability, wounds, and fatigue. A tripartate field of vision complicates melee combat, as characters dodge and weave, trying to land a fatal blow. Weapons that are at-the-ready are more effective, and if you slay one monster, your speed suffers for a moment as you dislodge your weapon from its corpse. Combat against multiple enemies is harrowing for all but the most powerful characters, and exhausting for all but the swiftest. "The Realm" is a dangerous place, and the end of each day in it is often best spent hiding. 

Each session of Magic Realm lasts 28 days in game-time, with each player choosing his or her own victory conditions at the beginning of the game (a feature later implemented in Tales of the Arabian Nights). You can focus on garnering fame and notoriety, hunt for great treasures, or accumulate piles of gold. I'm still adjusting to this aspect of the game, as it blends a degree of long-term planning and optimization with wildly unpredictable adventuring. Because Magic Realm is not campaign based, the designers went to great lengths to make each experience unique. The same locations, both general ("Deep Woods," "The Crag," etc.) and particular ("The Cairns," "The Altar"), are recurrent to from game to game, but the configuration of both layers is randomized. The game features unique rules for spawning and mobilizing monsters (clearly an influence on Arkham Horror), using environmental cues such as "Roar" "Flutter," "Smoke," and "Bones" as harbingers of doom. Your White Knight may see smoke rising from a rocky outcropping along the cliffs, only to be gobbled up by a Tremedous Dragon moments later. Or the dragon might be asleep. Or it might be nearby but not "prowling" (actively looking for characters). 

Magic Realm has one of the heaviest weight ratings on BGG (4.47/5). There's a lot to internalize here, and we play with something like 10 full-page player references displayed at one end of the table. But it's really not that hard to wake your character at "birdsong" and occupy him until "midnight." Some situations require careful attention to intricate and convoluted sequencing, but if you talk it through together you'll figure it out. Anyone who grew up reading fantasy novels should probably play this. Anyone who has ever done any tabletop fantasy Role Playing (D&D) [i]must[/i] play this. Almost nothing predates Magic Realm, and the hours spent within will give you a whole new perspective on the 30-year trajectory of fantasy gaming. 

Update: I think this might be more like an 8. A slow-starter, but usually the possibilities exceed your expectations.

It is amazing I was able to play to completion this game quite often during my teen years, so long ago, solitaire, using the first edition rulebook. I do not think I could manage now. The beauty of the map and some counters is unparalleled, and the combat system was very exciting. Fond memories.

A heavyish fantasy role-playing game. Despite it having a great fantasy setting, nice art and loads of monsters and a cool monster-warning system, the game is essentially about tanking (building a killing machine) and getting treasures. There was no other way to win the game (e.g. pickup and deliver quests, saving villagers, stealing treasure from monsters).

The pick-the-worst-die was a horrible mechanism that just made the game bog down. You would be forced to spend turn after turn searching or trading hoping to find that one lucky roll. Combat lacked tension and was anti-climatic since most times you could calculate the result without any dice-rolling. Also, there was no character buildup... some players were successfully killing dragons on Day One!

In the end, I just thought that there were too many rules for everything. Even though it might appear to provide a world of possibilities, I actually found it a hindrance to the accessibility of the game. Its not something you could expect to remember how to play after 3 months, and it was a little hard to get into the spirit of the game with so many little details to constantly remember.

A very interesting fantasy adventure game that is intriguing. The rules are incredibly complex and difficult to follow. I've started to learn this game many times, but have always abandoned it for something a little easier to comprehend, given my time available for games. Finally learned the game and feel it is less complex than initially believed to be. It is actually a very fun game with incredible flexibility and replayability. I've also taught it to a friend and we found the game to be great fun.

Should be a 9 because MR has piss-poor accessibility, a setup time longer than most games, a play time longer than most gaming session, a rule book more dense/complicated/voluminous than... well, you get the idea. I still rate it a 10 (partially 'cause I'll never get to play it often enough to ever get sick of it). EDIT: Yeah, okay, a 9 for the above reasons

I actually played the "First Encounter" treasure hunt and really enjoyed the most basic aspects of the game.

I bought this game long ago when I was exclusively a wargamer.  Needless to say, it was a tad different from "Stalingrad."  The hex tiles, colorful bits, and innovative mechanics planted the seeds for my later enjoyment of Eurogames.  From what I remember of the game, which I have not played in years, it took a long time, was fiddly, and had certain important peculiarities that made it hard for new players.  (For example, some characters can always beat others in combat so it is essential to stay away from your "perfect enemy" or you'll be eliminated immediately.)  Nonetheless, it was a blast at the time though I'm not sure today I'd find it worth the time necessary to play.

Since writing my first review I have taken the MR101 educational course and have since played the game solo once, online twice and many times in multiplayer. I'm still not sure it's truly a game, more like a statistical Choose Your Own Adventure book. Great movement mechanics and I love the way monsters are randomized. But my problem still lies in the fact that I feel really stupid when I play this. I constantly have to relook up rules that I thought I grasped several plays back. The complexity and balance are there but they're so complex and balanced that I sometimes wonder if the game is in fact playing ME. I'll play if someone asks me to but I think I'd rather save some brain cells and do something lighter if in the mood for a fantasy game.

Original Review: I don't get it. Statistic loving friends think this is FABULOUS. Takes an hour to set up and the combat system never made sense. I did enjoy the game components. The hexes and heros are pretty cool concepts. I also liked the story-line as it was described to me but honestly, should a game require a referee and interpreter? And if I'm in it for the story-line, might as well play RPGs or have the fore-mentioned referee just read me a story. I can see me now snuggled under a blanket with a cup of hot cocoa and the gaming friend who owns the game sitting in a big easy chair as he starts reading, "In a hole in the ground, lived a Hobbit. Not a wet, grimy hole, filled with the ends of worms but a Hobbit hole and that means comfort..." Sigh. Yeah, that sounds much more appealing.

A game of richness about fantasy RPG on a board, insted of in a PC.  This game really breaks the ground in RPG.  It has many inlfluences on so numerous games following.  The components are outdated in today's standard. But the true gem lies in its rulebook.  You can do to your character whatever you want!  The rules suck you in and you are never out. Amazing this was something produced a long time ago abck to the late 70's, wasn't it? It still illuminates the fate and history of wargaming in its own glory and its influence is still felt today in many ways.

Hardest rules EVER to understand...but once you do understand them, I think the mechanics of this game have tons of very subtle nuiances that are BRILLIANT.

This really is the ultimate fantasy game.  The sheer number of options that you have to consider in any given game is dwarfed only by the sheer number of rules and exceptions that need to be learned.  However, the combat system is amazing, adding brutal realism but clever tactics to what is often replaced with a single die roll in other fantasy games.  The exploration and prowling rolls make for the most exciting map in any exploration game.  The die roll system is brutal but productive.  The magic system has so many nuances and strategies that it's virtually a different game.

I can say so many things about this game, but really, only playing it can live up to your expectations and curiosity.

As to what edition to get, I have the Avalon Hill edition.  I have examined the Karim redesign very closely.  There are advantages to both.  The AH design has generally better art and strictly better map tiles.  However, weapon chits, monster chits, and denizen chits all leave something to be desired.  Also, AH magic cards and treasure cards are functionally fine and terrible material-wise.  Karim's redesign fixes many of the problems with the chits, adding a significant amount of information to the chits themselves and, more importantly, adding a consistent visual organization to the graphical design of the chits.  I can't understate how nice this is.  I'm very tempted to just make parts of the Karim redesign to mix with parts of the AH copy I have.

Jay Richardson's tutorial has been overwhelmingly useful.  Go download it from the files section if you have not yet done so.  3rd edition rules are also necessary, and can be found in the same place.

This game is awful.  The only reason I played is one of friends liked it.  Conceptually, it was ambitious for 1979, but it shipped with rules that were fundamentally broken.  For years, there has been errata created by fans of the game that make the game unbroken.  I would not say it is playable.  If you are going to play, you need to play with Realmspeak, but it is painfully long, fiddly and really pretty difficult.  The game has so many exceptions, magic is incredibly complicated and even with updated rules makes little sense.  Having said all this, when you beat a monster after defeating the puzzle, the game has its moments.  But it is just not worth it for the amount of time it takes you to learn.  Play Mage Knight if you want to play a good game that provides effectively the same experience.

A fantasy "explore the world, improve your character" game. A crossover between a boardgame and a RPG.

Wow, what can I say about this game?  It's both quite possibly the most complicated, yet most deep game ever made.  It took me weeks of studying the rules and watching/reading tutorials every day before I had a basic understanding of how to play.  I felt like I deserved a geek badge just for doing it.  But the payoff for learning it is worth it.

This game might as well be called "Fantasy World Simulator", it's got everything and more that you'd expect from a plausible fantasy epic.

The rule complexity does hurt this game, however.  I have to give props to Mage Knight for taking this formula and improving on it, at least in small ways.

Started playing two years ago. Although I mostly play the game using the excellent java implementation, RealmSpeak, I'm starting to play the real game more as I gradually get the hang of the rules.This game is the only game I've found that is really successful as a boardgame RPG without GM. There is no other board game that will give you the experiences and adventures you can live in the Realm. The game successfully recreates a world with its own logic and workings and is very open ended. You can do whatever you want. Choose a character and choose your own victory conditions. Want to go for treasure? Want to go kill monsters? Want to go after the other characters? Etc...And the combat system is unique and very unforgiving, but once you learn when to fight, when to run, and when to take a chance, it's very satisfactory.Also, even though the rules are complex, there are a lot of helpful files to learn the game easier, and the playing community is very active and quick to answer any question. Also, with RealmSpeak, you can play the game fast, and see the outcome for your actions. Once you've read through the rules and tried the game once or twice, you can use it to get the hang of playing the game quite fast.

That's the white rhino, you might searched for - a father and generalization of all adventure games. It seems that Magic Realm after rather large simplification may become any other adventure game! Never seen such complication - enormous.
The rules are full-grown and it seems that the manual can speak and walk on its own. If you dare to play that, be warned: you will not even know where to put your shield or what it's good for anyway. Don't laugh: the manual should possess a manual of its own manual. It seems that every possible aspect of fantasy world is reflected in the mechanics and has a table or two. I want to play it and don't want to play it the same time - I fear the game like derivative equations exam!

Early impressions make me think this game is amazing, but time will tell.  Seems super cool.  Rule book (2nd Ed) is bad but not horrific.  Main issue is that it repeats itself again and again and has no index.  Game is quite long, but as the game opens up it all makes more sense.

Lowered rating to reflect just how bad some elements of the game are - way overly complex for the low fun return. Very, very, very random. Mage Knight is the clear descendant and clearly a better game.

I got this for Christmas the year it came out. It took a me years to figure out all of this games nuances because Avalon Hill didn't allow time for a good user manual to be developed. I've talked to people that swear it is the greatest board game ever produced. I have reached a point where I appreciate the genius of the design and I can really see their point. I can't think of another board game that has given me so many completely diverse plays. If you are trying to figure it out start googling. There is a much better set of rules online now along with some very good video tutorials. Also some additional starter materials to get you understanding the mindset. Basically the game works like a big computer program. Once I looked at it that way it made a lot more sense. It is clear that it was way ahead of its time in that respect.

I've started to play Mage Knight. I have a long way to go but from what I've played it is clear that a huge debt is owed to Magic Realm. I wish they would have just done an official reboot of Magic Realm since it is clear Mage Knight will never match the play diversity of Magic Realm.

I have played this game for 20 years and I have never played or watched a game that didn't have some new delightful or astounding event.  I wish I could figure out some way to make it a simple game, but each mechanism I think to simplify defeats in some way the subtlety and depth of the design.  I can only offer my 8-page rule summary (available for downloading on the 'geek) and point out that the game takes on a life of its own when your imagination is strong enough to read a whiny Escort Party, naive young Rogue, or belligerent Knight of the Order out of the charming capriciousness of the 2d6 rolls!

Simply, the best fantasy board game ever made.  It's the closest thing to role playing in a board game.  However, it belongs to another era (the 70's!) and is highly complex with a complicated (but realistic) battle system and tons of cardboard counters.

That said, you can take up to 16 characters on a wild go anywhere, do anything ride on a modular board of individual hexes that makes a different map each time you play.  This is not a linear adventure...you explore a land acquiring treasure, killing monsters for fame and evil denizens for notoriety in search of the Dragon's Hoard, the Lair, the Demon's Shrine, the Winged Demon's Altar, the Pool, the Cairns, the Statue and the Crypt of the Knight.  Fabulous treasures lie within some of which may confer great power or helpful assists.  

Along, the way you meet people, forge alliances with whom you can ride to war, conquest or raids on side missions...or just take along to help you in your quests.

Throughout it all, Magic permeates the land, twisting the very landscape and providing powerful advantages to those with the knowledge. When you have accumulated the secret goals you yourself have chosen (according to a set number of points you must award), you win!

For those with time on their hands, an eye to detail and patience to digest an extremely complicated rulebook, this is one of the most theme filled and satisfying boardgames you'll EVER play.

RATING: 9
In my opinion, one of the most brilliant boardgame designs of all time, but badly needed a crackerjack developer along the way to make it more accessible. I bought this as soon as it was released, when I was about 13, and I was shocked at how many critical game concepts weren't explained at all in the rules. The combat system is probably too convoluted, but it *does* allow for some imaginative play and some startling occurrences. What a shame that Hamblen had to gut his original idea of several expansions. Includes more ingenius game mechanics than a dozen other good games put together. In this game's case, the complexity has a decent payoff, since there are so many ways the game can be played. Probably should be rated a '10' for those not bothered by the mass of rules. (although I maintain it's really not as complicated as its reputation. The 1st edition rules weren't great, and the the 2nd edition are better, at the cost of fairly ridiculous length. (The game isn't super approachable, but it's not that bad, I promise. Worth learning if you are interested because it's such a good design)

It should be noted that his for the MR redesign.  Although it does take some time to go through the rules and figure out what exactly is going on here, there is a tremendous payoff at the end.  This game walks that theoretical boarder between genius and insanity, as almost everything has been thought out pretty well and you could play a 100 times with different results.  However, this has a price in a steep learning curve and needing to devote plenty of hours, which may be too much for some gamers.

I bought this because I found it relatively (though not absolutely) cheap on eBay. But I HATE this game--or at least I hated it when I was a kid. So I guess I've got to figure out how to play it and give it another try. I never forgave my then best friend for forcing me to play this in high school. It seriously traumatized me. But I admit it was only one play, and possibly I was in a bad mood or it was just a bad day or I was prejudiced by the fact that my friend generally had lousy taste in games or something equally vapid that I refuse to apologize for. I guess I would play it again if there were some relatively painless way to learn the rules.

This game rocks.  I am getting better each time, and soon will have it down pat.  Looks to have incredible depth.  Now have two copies again to allow me to play with up to 16 when I have 15 friends over.  The fact that all these characters, each of which needs to be played so differently, can win the game is amazing!  Finally figured out the magic system as well.

Tremendous.  Such an intriguing system.  Even though the learning curve is laughably hard (at least on your own) the payoff is huge.

Now I just have to stop using Realmspeak as my crutch and learn this game properly on the tabletop.

This is the game for workaholics. Even if you´ve worked through the rules, the learning process hasn´t ended. How to play each charakter, how to kill all these monsters - esp. when the game mechanics use a minimum of luck -, dealing with natives, which is the right magic in a specific situation, find all these hidden treasures, etc. Wow! I love it. Thís game is worth every effort. So don´t give up the fight against yourself reading the rules and then against the realm. Furthermore try to learn the game even solitaire by using realmspeak as a wonderful PC-tool to play with players around the world.

My initial enthusiasm for this game has cooled. It is very, very complex, and just keeping the rules fresh requires regular study and playing!

My own taste has turned towards simpler, tighter, and shorter games.

This is THE fantasy board game for me.

Packed with strategy, tactics and imagination, I really don't know where to begin in describing this game's awesomeness.

There are 16 characters to choose from, all of whom play very differently to their core. We're not talking Talisman here, where each character has slightly different stats. The abilities of each character in MR determine entire classes of monsters, natives and other characters that you are capabable of defeating. They are each capable of following different victory strategies, some are more flexible than others...Some characters fare best all by their lonesome, while others are better for supporting a party.

Luck and randomness are a big part of the game, but it doesn't feel random! Clues tip you off that a type of monster is going to show up - it's only a matter of when. Do you want to hang around this place knowing a Tremendous Troll could show up at any moment? You must make the best decision by balancing your ability to fight or evade the troll with what you want to get out of the area (e.g. treasure looting or just passing through). The game is full of these "push your luck" types of decisions. Beautiful design.

The combat system is unique and intriguing. An elegant chit system determines attack and move strength, speed and fatigue. It has to be experienced.

Magic Realm polarizes players' opinions - the complex rules can be daunting - but it seems that persistent players eventually love the game! We've seen "conversions" where a player who couldn't stand the game does a complete 180 because he gave the game a few more tries, and the rules eventually clicked.

Realmspeak is great, free software to make this game much more playable - no setup times, you can watch the game play out while referencing the rules (I recommend using the combat simulator first)...internet play...

So stick with it and enjoy!

It's a challenging and fun game. It requires a lot of skill to play it well. I like the fact that it's brutal and lethal. It has a steep learning curve but with some persistence the rules are learnable and it plays quickly. But a 10? Yes, it's that good! Update: I've been learning this game now for some time and at last I started to feel more comfortable with the rules. I still have a lot to learn, especially with spellcasters etc. But thanks to RealmSpeak I am now able to actually play the game. Well, it's amazing. It's so deep and full of surprises. There are so many thing to discover, it's incredible.

One of the first "dungeon crawl" games with a choice of up to 16 characters. Your character has different abilities, such as toughness, armor, quickness, etc.  Each character has different victory conditions. I played this a few times in the mid 80's and it is nostalgic for me, but probably a bit long to set up and figure out the rules again. I did play with someone who completely understood the rules, so my rating maybe different if I had to figure out everything for myself.

First impression: Only played one game where we started with lvl 4 characters and there was no magic in the game. Still there was quite a lot of rules to be understood before game (and I had read a quick reference to rules beforehand). First two days took 1 hour to play. This was because of some battles that occurred and needed further rules explanation to get us through them. Game took overall 5,5 hours which seems acceptable amount for the first game with 4 (out of 5) newbie players. After few rounds game seems to go rather smoothly. Battles seemed to confuse us until end of the game even though they aren't really that tricky (although probably most rules-complex part in the game). 

After just looking upon 100 pages of rules I thought Magic Realm might be a behemoth of a game with so many rules that it's starting to be unplayable. Actually the game goes rather smoothly without too much downtime unless you're waiting for other players to do their battles. I like how the game seems to offer quite many possibilities for cooperative/solo play and different characters force you to play differently. I'm waiting for the next time to play since the core system works very well and Magic Realm is a very interesting adventure gaming experience.

I must mention that I like game's atmosphere a lot. It has a really tough world to be in and just surviving all 4 weeks seems to be enough challenge itself for beginners.

What a beast. The rules are a huge barrier to entry. I can see that if you make the time investment to know this game inside out, firstly that'd be a source of satisfaction in itself and secondly there might be satisfaction in playing the odds well and knowing exactly how best to go about things to increase your pleasure with the game and the process of playing. But for mere mortals, having experienced a largely seemingly random affair with incredibly tough monsters and death imminent if you don't play continually safely, I have no reason to want to ever play this again. Turns consist of secretly written down actions (mostly moves), reveal chits, see if monsters come out, and roll, roll, roll for everything - searches, hides, combat, everything. You need to know the system inside out to work out how to even create the chance to roll to get something you need into play. That's way too much work for way too much random. The recent crop of theme-dripping, component-rich, easy to play, and more importantly fun to play, thematic ride games, all playable in a reasonable timeframe, put this game in the dust. Trampled.

Out of the box, the rules make this game hard to get into.  Using resources on the internet you have a fairly easy time figuring things out.  It is definitely worth it to stick with this game!  Once you "get it" it's pretty easy to play and very addictive.

Edit: I had this at a "9", but had to boost it to a "10".  The rules are still hard to get into at first, but this game has incredible depth and nearly endless replay value.  I can think of no other game that I play as much (thanks to Realmspeak).

I've been playing this game since I was 10.  I didn't realize at the time how legendary the complexity of the rules were, since my Dad led us through the adventure kind of like a dungeon master.  I think anyone can play this game actually if one person knows the game inside and out, as I have led others through play in a similar manner.  I would say even that the initial game preamble is shorter than many Euros, and the idea of playing at least is totally intuitive.  All those rules exist really so you can do anything you want.  It takes the complete opposite approach of D&D for this by making every possible event specified by the rules, whereas D&D is mostly "make it up until you fight, then roll some dice with modifiers until something dies".  

Magic Realm is a true adventure.  Characters that play completely differently from one another.  Items with weight that some characters can carry.  Or you can get a horse and have that carry it if you can't lift it yourself!  Magic?  We have 8 kinds, but you can probably only learn 2 or 3.  Unless you are the Magician, but then you are not necessarily good at any one type.  Or get a spellbook!  Then you can cast a spell even if you aren't a magic user.  Can't find the path?  Enchant the map tile and turn it over to reveal the way through!  Giant Octopus have you ensnared in its inexorable tentacles?  Throw the potion you just found looting the pool to save yourself at the last minute!  Can't run from the giant spiders?  Turn yourself into a squirrel and scurry away!  You can do pretty much anything you can imagine here, and some things you can't imagine because you haven't played Magic Realm enough to discover them.  And it is all covered by the rules.  I have never encountered a game world so vast and so rich as Magic Realm.  A true classic.

Pretty much one of the heaviest game I ever game across (non-wargame that is). I never got around to play it. I can see the point of this game. In times of pre-computer game hype and pre-roguelikes, Magic Realm generated fantasy worlds for your heroes to roam about in. As of now, it feels outdated and tedious, although I respect its iconic status.

Cant say enough about this game ... My groups number one game, playing for 25+ years.

Magic Realm is one of the most outstanding games ever. It has the appealing of a RPG combined with the best of the boardgaming. Despite its age (1978) it is absolutely alive and fresh for today. The question would be: how many later games owe something to Magic Realm? Play it in group is adictive so beware!! :). It was one of my first gaming experience and one of the most difficult to learn. It is not for novices but once you master it you can play on a endless set of combinations. It has several minor cons like it is too slow on terms of game development, too much writing that makes it a little boring. Anyway a must be in any collection. Do not hesitate in acquiring a copy and pay a bunch of bucks because it is worth the game.

RATING: 10
An incredibly complex masterwork by Richard Hamblen; fantasy gaming's answer to Advanced Squad Leader. Poorly written rules kept the game from ever reaching its true potential. This is a game that you either love or hate... there doesn't seem to be much of a middle ground. If you enjoy games with high fantasy/Tolkien-like themes, and don't mind high complexity and a four to six hour playing time, it might be a game for you. Even after all of these years there is nothing to match it. The highly rated fantasy games that Magic Realm's detractors like to recommend as being better are all much simpler games with nowhere near the immersiveness and depth of detail... comparing them to Magic Realm is like comparing a 10 page short story to a 600 page novel - they are such radically different creations that very little direct comparison is possible. Love it or hate it, Magic Realm remains the standard against which all other boardgame RPG's are measured.

The best immersion fantasy game ever made. Complex, yet complete. Excellent replay value and well suited for solitaire play. Don&#039;t EVER let a newbie choose a magic character or the BLACK KNIGHT their first time learning. It will slow the game to an unbearable level and frustrate them and you. It takes a few times playing to learn the game to an independent level, but it is well worth it. I play this game regularly FTF with a large group.

Has survived the test of time. The components are awful, though.

There is no other fantasy adventure game like it. I've played them all: Rune Bound, Talisman, World of Warcraft - the Boardgame, Lord of the Rings, Kings & Things, Wizard´s Quest, Dragon Pass, Titan and that Euro-clone of MR itself. Some of them come close, but none go all the way. Now, if someone could make an expansion...

*EDIT*: Changed from 8 to 9. This is due to the fantastic work by Karim (and others). The components are fantastic. This rating is thus not based on what could be made with a ´70:s printer but by modern DTP. Assembly work acquired though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is one of my favorite games ever.  The level of detail is amazing.  I realize the complexity turns some people off, but honestly if you take the time to learn, you will like it.  Also, I'm a sucker for games where the players have different abilities, and MR features that in spades.  You start with a unique character, you choose your own objectives, you decide where you want to go and what to do, you can team up with other players or fight them.  It's like a role-playing game, only better.

Also, check out Realmspeak -- the best java implementation of any board game ever. Computer versions of board games are usually a bit dull, but since MR plays so well as a solitaire game, the java version really rocks.

RATING: 9
25-05-2015. Rated after about 15 plays. Even after 15 plays I can't say I fully understand the game. I am still busy trying to learn the game and so far I have only used the Berserker..

In Magic Realm, you pick a character and which VPs your character is aiming to get in the 28 days the game takes. You can get VPs from finding Treasures and Magical spells, gaining Fame and Notoriety and Gold. Each 'day', you begin in the birdsong phase where you plan your (typically) 2 to 4 actions for the turn. With those actions you move on a hex-board from clearing to clearing trying to kill monsters, find treasures..

(Melee) Combat is interesting, in that you have partial information on your enemies (ie. statistics), but they can flip changing their stats. If you are quicker than your opponent you have a good chance to kill them in one hit, but otherwise they 'jump', from location to location with you trying to outguess or survive the monsters. 

Magic Realm is HARSH. When I started leaning the game, I often just died day 1 or 3. Now I survive to day 28 (end), and come close to positive amounts of VPs depending if I am lucky finding the treasure tiles. I now understand and know why I died, how I can best attack these enemies and how to proceed.

I enjoy the game a LOT. I must say, the old version (I own second edition 1986) is ugly and it's a lot of charts. I favor Realmspeak for me solo-adventures, in which most of the tables and stuff is basically done automatically. Regardless, it works. The game is fun, highly complicated puzzle that I can lose track of time in. Excellent game, highly recommended. But beware, the rules are dense and hard to grasp.

---
I log solo plays on Realmspeak as playing the boardgame. Just because set-up/tear down is such a beast and the game is identical.

RATING: 10
--Dec2003-- Probably the only 'monster game' of my youth that I'm still willing to break out.  Managed to hook my 8-year old on it; he's even willing to do the setup!
--03Aug2004-- Improved to 9, based on multiple recent plays.  The boy's now 9, and still is enchanted by _MR_: absolutely his top-rated game.

One of the really cool things about Magic Realm, in my opinion, is the robustness of the game to slightly incorrect play.  It's not particularly important that you know all the rules!  While that's obvious in the staged encounters, it's also true in the more general sense:  if one plays by a (consistent but) incorrect collection of rules, the game is still generally enjoyable.  And then when one later discovers the historic error, the new rule interpretation can be employed in subsequent games happily.  When you compare with a current Euro whose rules are so crystalline that a single misinterpretation breaks the experience, something a bit sloppier can be amusing.

--Aug2005-- Most likely of my games to be promoted to 10 - though it took 4.5 years!

RATING: N/A
The number of adventure games, dungeon crawlers, and RPG's that use a dice mechanic are about what, a bazillion? MR stands out by using a chit-based mechanic that covers combat, wounds, fatigue, weapon speed, weapon damage, armor (including shields and helmet, as well as armor damage), hirelings, and a few other adventuring tropes condensed into six cardboard chits per player. 

Unfortunately, the rest of the game feels less heroic than calculating all the working parts of an intricate puzzle. Much of the game is perfect information, with die rolls giving you more information you need to digest, rather than a straight chance of success.

Still, a very unique take on game design for this otherwise overworked genre.

Difficult to rate... Has a lot going for it, scores highly as uniquely interesting, hell of an investment in time and effort to actually play it. Would probably take it to a desert island, can't see it getting much play otherwise. What's the rating for 'Outstanding game - too intimidating to even consider playing in most circumstances' . N/A will have to do for now.
EDIT: April 2011 - Somehow, coming back to this after a hiatus helps, as does diving into RealmSpeak occassionally to see examples of the rules in play. Second time around is making much more sense, and I am enjoying this a lot more as a pastime and game, rather than as an acute mental workout. I am now considering trying to get this to the table with other humans - it can and must be done!
EDIT: April 2013. Two years later, I have again traded away my own copy, but got to play with ANOTHER HUMAN on the p&p redesign. This is a great game. Set up and take down are frankly a chore, but it's worth the while, if only once every few years...

OH HOW I want to like this game, I can see why many people do, random board configurations, some cool mechanics, and an rpg feel.  However, the set up time takes forever, postage stamp size cards, and the treasure set up card is horribly crowded with chits and cards. I studied the 1st and 3rd edition rules and can say honestly that I could not teach this, nor do I want to take the time to set it up.  I doubt this will see the table again with so many other games I love to play or want to try.

I soooooo want to like Magic Realm. This is the first time I've seen interconnected hex pieces used to create random terrain, a feature later made popular by Settlers of Cataan. There's a lot of depth in this game, but the rules are indecipherable. We tried, we really tried. We even blew up some of the boards onto 6 11x17 sheets and mounted them to make the game easier to play. At some point I may take a look at some of the rule rewrites and give it another shot.

Immersive, fiddly, but damn, it's fun. Probably the most incredibly deep and realistic (Oh, you're a sorceror trying to take on a Flying Dragon? You're dead) adventure game ever made. 

Has bucketloads of RPG-narrative.

But combat is a clunky crapshoot (even though the underlying ideas are great). There are tons of rules and exceptions and quite a fair few tables to reference. 

There needs to be a streamlined combat system and also a redesign of the rules presentation so that all the information is easily accessible. Yes, I know that there have been at least two redesigns but they each have their flaws...

I think of Magic Realm as the Mona Lisa of board games. Its perhaps unprecedented complexity enables a huge imaginative range of strategic options and generates amazing and unexpected stories with almost every play. After hundreds of RealmSpeak games with my dad over 5 years now (as of Dec. 2016), I am still blown away by surprising and highly improbable game events: "I didn't know that could even happen!" I pored over the game rules as a kid, sure that it had great potential. The RealmSpeak Java implementation helped me finally to learn the rules; it facilitates gameplay as a kind of AI GM. If you take the time to learn the rules well, perhaps with the help of RealmSpeak, then I think you'll agree that this game is a work of art.

When I first started trying to figure out Republic of Rome, I thought the rulebook absurd and obfuscated.  Nearly impenetrable.  Now it seems like a breeze (ok not a breeze, but compared to this???).  I think this wins for the worst intro game that I've played.

For newbies hours can go by before you even get the board set up.  There are so many little rules that you need to know, that you are constantly trying to scry info from the rulebook.  I can't even imagine playing this with Magic yet...

I think the biggest mystery about this game is why I enjoy this so much.  It is strangely entertaining.

Appears to have the potential to replace Arkham Horror for my all-day gaming opportunities. Unfortunately, it really takes the rough equivalent of a 3-semester-hour college class (not exaggerating here) to learn the rules. And the first step to learning it is to put the rulebook back into the box--it's just not helpful enough to warrant the pain it takes to read.

So it may be end up being primarily a solo game, but I'm okay with that.

I bought this when it first appeared, back in the late '70's and I have spent many hours trying to figure it out.  Only lately have I finally mastered the rules well enough to not die immediately when I venture into the Realm.  I can hire Natives and work them pretty well.  My skill with the magic elements isn't great but I can get by.   Despite the fiddliness in the game, it is strangely satisfying.  Games such as Magic Realm, published in the late '70's, were obtained by me while I was a young man in grad school and there is an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia when I contemplate these games.  So, I carry a bit of emotional baggage around with a soft spot in my heart for games such as Magic Realm which elevates their importance to me beyond, perhaps, what the game intrinsically deserves.

I won't argue the common opinion that Magic Realm is probably the richest and most intricate RPG-on-a-board that you can buy, even by today's standards. It probably is. But for the -absolutely not overstated- massive hassle of rules overhead plus the level of setup and in-game bookkeeping, I could spend the same amount of time having oodles more fun playing a REAL RPG.

The rating is on playability terms alone. With RealmSpeak, the free (Java?) client that automates the bookkeeping, it's probably a five.

The good - This is a very rich fantasy-roleplaying game.  It doesn't have the character development of Prophecy, but is much more focused over a one-month period.  It took 2 hours for rules, and then the game took 5.

I found a well used copy in a back corner of my local game store piled together with dozens of other games by Avalon Hill, SPI, Yaquinto, and other greats of yore. Not knowing much about games that were around when I was a baby I thought I'd give one a try. As a fantasy buff this one looked to have the right ingredients. 15$ and 1 month later  (and probably after 50 hours of learning the rules) this has become my favorite game of all time. It is delightfully  complex, brutally tough, and completely rewarding. Magic Realm is filled with replayability and always surprising. It was ahead of it's time and is still unlike anything else I've ever played. It is a whole fantasy narrative that is strategic, compelling, and ultimately the most fun I've had from a board game. Find a copy. LEARN IT. It is WORTH it.

Raised my rating partly because I've gained some better understanding of the game; but mostly because of the existence of RealmSpeak which means you can play this game solo easily and quickly.  No set-up or tear-down time!  Can't recommend it highly enough.

I can't beleive I just clicked the "Owned" checkbox of Magic Realm... :meeple:
burdisho created a redesigned PnP version of the game and gave it to me as a birthday present!
I know it took a tremendous amount of time and effort to create something like this and a feel very lucky and excited to receive such a gift.
I have already read the rules and run a dozen games in realmspeak, so i am ready for some real games!

03/07/2015:
Increased rating from 8 to 9.
A year later and our 3 player group has almost 50 plays of this great game.
After the first 20 plays we started using the superb Book of Quests and most of the Optional Rules including the Optional Combat Rules.
The game has endless posibilities and i hope we can find another few people to start playing 4-5 player games.
Being an adventure-simulation game, it has several drawbacks and some of our plays are not as interesting as others.
On the other hand, each play spins a new tale and unique stories are unfolded by the characters of the Realm

I am very glad i had the chance to learn this game, the patience to let it show me its depth and beauty and the luck to find other players eager to explore the Realm with me!

All the above wouldn't have been possible without the contributions (PnP, Redesign, 3rd edition rules, Book of Learning, Book of Quests, Realmspeak, BGG articles,Tutorials, player aids etc. ) of many users. 
I want to thank all of them for their time and effort! :)

Great fantasy theme.  Game is not easy to learn or play, very complicated and fiddly.  Game play is good.  Nice movement and combat system, although the combat system does create downtime.  The componets are fair.  Modular cardboard board, cardbard chits.  The rulebook is a monster and could be clearer.  Game play is very long.

RATING: 10
This is definitely the best game I have ever played.

At first glance it may look like a typical hack'n'slay Dungeon&Dragons game, but this perception is wrong.
Magic Realm is a strategy game by its heart. Each of the 16 characters necessitates a different strategic approach to the game. Heavy fighters tend to put their victory conditions on fame and notoriety and go hunting monsters. Other characters have excellent abilities in hiring native inhabitants of the Realm for help. And then there are the magic wielders, each of them with a different set of magical capabilities and spells.

During gameplay you can never just "throw the dice in a bucket" and see what's coming up. The game is far too deadly for this. You really have to think about all of your available choices, both strategically and tactically. For a fantasy themed game there is actually surprisingly little luck involved, once you have mastered the intricacies of the combat system.

There is a lot of support on the Internet for this game and avid fans have been developing this game further for more than 20 years. You will find 3rd edition rules, expansion hex tiles, more than 40 additional characters and much more.
As one of my geek buddies has put it: Magic Realm is a hobby in itself - much like ASL for the wargaming community.

This game has incredible depth and nearly endless replay value. 

And last but not least there is Realmspeak, a Java application of the game which lets you play with distant friends over the Internet or just solitaire on your PC.
I have played more than 800 games of Magic Realm via this program!

Fun system, though the combat leaves a bit to be desired in the end--a little too programmed in the sense that it's mainly about your alpha strike and preparation for the same.  There are very few epic battles so there's as much suspense in revealing treasure as in fighting.

Keep in mind that these comments are based on one and a quarter plays; I'm not sure we ever had the combat system perfectly right.  This seemed like an ambitious game that fell short.  The mechanics felt like very complicated rules kludged on top of fairly simple concepts.  The information is spread annoyingly around over tables and chits in a haphazard fashion.  Combat seemed very 'all or nothing', and we were barely using all the little chits.  Not worth the massive time investment.

I know a lot of people really like this game a lot, but after giving it a shot, I fail to see why it has achieved such a cult-like following. Maybe it's because I played solo rather than with a group, but there didn't seem to be a lot of difficult or interesting choices to be made. Disappointing because I was really looking forward to getting this on the table.

Probably one of my favorite games, though I recognize its flaws.  The first and second edition rulebooks are frustrating to work through.  The "third edition" rulebook is awesome, but far longer than I really can use.  It just seems that the rules could be a lot shorter and yet more coherant than the 1st or 2nd ed.  

edit - been playing Mage Knight a lot lately and find the game provides a similar feel (though there are a lot of MR elements that I miss).  

I am blown away by what the fan community has done with MR and find the fan-based product superior to the AH version.  Just wish it was easier to make.

  This game takes SO much time and effort to learn. And unlike Mage Knight, there really isn't anyone around that knows the game enough to teach the whole game. But there are a few people around who know parts of the game, and that's what I did; I learned a part here from this guy, and learned a part there from that guy. Then I hit the online guides, and Y'know what? Before too long, my son and I had played our first game of Magic Realm. It felt like completing a grail.

  And man, was this game hard! You have to try really hard not too get your character killed, which is so cool! I mean, there are creatures in MR, that you don't EVER want to come across. And sometimes, no matter how much you want to stay and fight, you just have to run away in order to stay alive. I love that part, that you aren't All Powerful, and that you need to be cautious. It makes it about surviving in the Magic Realm, not dominating it.

  The characters are fantastic, they all play so differently. And you can tweak them, depending on what you find or buy, or what direction you want to take them. That's my favourite part of this game.

  For a game that's over thirty years old to be this good is unbelievable. It was way ahead of it's time.

Its a lot of fun with the right mix of people. I dont find it as complicated as many here, but I learned the 1st Edition as a base many years ago. The game offers an awful lot in terms of variety and challenge so to me, its worth the learning curve to enjoy a game that is this deep.  Edit...After repeated play using RealmSpeak, MR just keeps getting better and better. If you haven't tried RealmSpeak, I highly recommend it both as a learning tool and to actually play competitively.

12 Nov 2007: Where do I start with Magic Realm? From the fantastic theme? Or the realistic exploration system? Or the suspense-filled treasure-hunting? Or the vast number of options? Or the knack for plans to go horribly wrong, or sometimes incredibly right? My love for this game is only tempered with the longing for a better combat system, but otherwise this is a fantastic game.

19 May 2015: How could I have not tried the Optional Combat Rules earlier!? These make Magic Realm a game that I COULD play, to a game that I WANT to play.

This rating is after my first try at solo-play...I really look forward to playing it again with other players! A complex and "old-fashioned" monster of a fantasy-game - but quite worth the effort.
Update 01/06: Almost a year later I tried it again with a friend! We didn´t really get very far in this game and only played two days. This, including going though the rules and set-up, took about five hours. We LOVED cracking those rules (again thanks to Yoder for his "MR in plain english"-Document!) and will try to meet again soon to finally play a complete game. :-P
05/06/07: Had to lower the rating from 8 to 6. While I´d love to play the game, there just are not many other people insane enough. Theoratically I love the game but haven´t played even half a game in the more than two years that I own it. Propably simply unplayable.
10/19/09: Sold on ebay. It's a game that will never get played and I need the space.

RATING: 7
Very difficult game to learn, even with the layered encounter system stated in the rules.  Game mechanics are very involved and sometimes tedious. However, the &quot;game system works as the dungeon master&quot; offers a compelling and deep framework to ensure that every Magic Realm game will be different.  Once the rules have been mastered, this is one of the best fantasy strategy games available.  Another bonus is that the game can be played solitaire.  This game is definitely for hardcore gamers; beginners need not apply and should look for much easier games.

What a great game.  I realize this isn't for everyone, as it is a very complex game.  However, for me, endlessly poring over the rulebook is tons of fun.  The game is thematic enough so that the Realm feels tangibly dangerous.  I love that.  Every game comes out completely different.  I love that as well.

The game tells a rich narrative as it goes, and each narrative is so different that the game is very replayable.  The 16 characters differ in some subtle and some extreme ways, but each has its own flavor.  Very rare things happen all of the time in the Realm, so every game will produce one or more "guess what happened!?!?" moments.  Brilliant!

One time, we had the Cloven Hoof show up in the Chapel, which caused the Chapel to radiate White and Black Magic.  I guess the portal to hell was in the basement or something.  The terribly cursed Druid was attempting to crawl into the Chapel to cure himself.  The bad luck of the Hoof, plus bad relations with the Order, plus being unable to use gold to buy drinks made for a hilarious Magic Realm moment!

Thanks to RealmSpeak I'm finally able to play and rate Magic Realm.  Probably the best fantasy board game ever developed (I can't think of another that's come close and I've played a lot) and ranks with Indonesia as one of the two best non-18xx games I own.  Some very innovative mechanics that have never been replicated in either board, card or computer form and the random setup and distinct characters means significant replay value.   If you want to play the board game I recommend downloading and using the redesigned counters.   Would love to get another copy for double board - and it really needs a water/jungle/desert type expansion.

After several plays on Realmspeak, and several subsequent face to face plays on my home-built version of Karim's set, I can confirm my true appreciation for this game. There's quite a learning curve, but a myriad of narrative experiences awaits for those who put in the effort. That much is clear from my relatively limited number of plays. 

Increasing familiarity with MR rules and strategy will reward the intrepid adventurer with ever more satisfying, utterly unique gaming sessions.

It's well worth the time and effort to learn Magic Realm. For me a solid 10.

I admit I was apprehensive on going into this game, but I was rather suprised. Set up and rules explanation seem to have taken forever, but in the end I enjoyed it. It *was* long , but very fun and full of possibilities. Plotting turns as a mechanic always frightens me, especially in miniatures systems (yikes), but it's straight forward here and after a few turns you've got it down. I'm sure it helps a ton when you're playing with someone who's fluent with the rules.

The Realm is a cruel mistress. If you're not careful you *will* be killed. If you are careful, you'll probably be killed. Best to send those henchlings in to the hoard while you hang out by the campfire swilling beer. Infinite variability and replay value. Well worth the effort to learn if you have a group which plays this gem. Expansions abound if you're in to mammoth games.

It takes a fair amount of understanding of the combat and spawning mechanics, not to play the game, but to play it without inviting swift death. This seems like both a strength and a weakness.

Sometimes I honestly believe this game is a work of genius, but at any rate there are some neat game mechanics and it does reasonably well at what it sets out to do, which is simulate a role playing game master.  There is much randomness as far as the set up of treasures, but from there the careful calculating of odds is the main emphasis.  It's a freestyle game, you can play any way you want to within the same rule set and you set your own victory conditions at the start of the game.  This is the earliest example I can think of of a game which uses arrangable hex pieces as a game board.

MR is an absolutely tremendous game, totally unlike (and superior to) any other fantasy-themed game I've seen. While it has all the usual fantasy trappings (magic, treasure, monsters, etc.), it plays much more like a wargame than the usual fantasy dicefest - lots of strategy, probability analysis, and calculated gambles. Not easy to learn (especially if you're trying to learn only with Realmspeak), but well worth the investment. This is one of the few games I've played that leaves you with the feeling that you've experienced something truly unique.

Update: After several years of on-and-off play, I finally have to break down and give this game the 10 it deserves. Every time I come back to it, I'm astounded at its depth, narrative, originality, and challenge. Learning all of the various subsystems of the game, including combat with natives and magic, requires a great deal of study and practice, but the result is a game almost unparalleled in its possibilities.

Update 2: With the release of Mage Knight, Magic Realm finally has a competitor in the "serious fantasy adventure game" niche some 30 years after its publication. I still think MR edges out MK in overall quality, especially on narrative. But MK, despite its complexities, is a whole lot easier to pick up and play without spending a day relearning rules intricacies. I can't ever see giving up on MR completely, but I think I'll often reach for MK unless I truly have the time to spare that's required to dive back into MR. Dropped rating to a 9.

RATING: 10
A king-of-the-hill classic with all the quintessential elements of the fantasy world. 
The various characters are not just prototypical in name only but also in gameplay sytle. 
Many groundbreaking features remain unique, particularly the double-sided tiles, the clever design of the sound and warning chit system and the highly sophisticated combat and magic system. 
Each treasure and spell comes with very distinct functions and effects, rather than just adding/subtracting the die roll or the number of dice as in most other games. The replayability is virtually unlimited as the game never runs out of surprise and fresh narrative, and so the game simply doesn't need any break on my shelf.

If you are in the mood for a very complex boardgame with a heavy RPG theme this game is for you. Rules need a vast rewrite however. Someone said this is a game with more exceptions than rules and he is right. Still, can be fun if in the mood. Good RPG simulation feel.

Yes, it is a deep and engaging game, but it is also really too fiddly and the rules are way too complicated for the experience that it delivers.

An RPG in boardgame form.  Plays very well solo.  The rules are rather complicated, and while it takes some serious effort and dedication to learn them, it's very worthwhile and the payoff is great.  A real classic.

After over a year reading and studying the rules I finally got this on the table and started playing it. We didn't finish the game but one thing is clear: This game is an absolute blast! 

I still don't fully understand it but I can see this being a lifetime love affair!

If anyone has a new (Karim's) edition that they are willing to trade or sell I'm interested.

I don't think I ever understood the combat system. We played it a few times, and I think the mechanics swamp any atmosphere. A fantasy game designed by a mathematician. NOt that it's all bad, just not for me.

Well I've played one game and it is definitely fun. Although I had one heck of a string of luck as the berserker who found a golden Idol and hired the whole band of rogues and looked for the octopus at the bottom of the pool and found only treasure. Then going to the cavern to find some more goodies who killed the troll with his warband of rogues. All in all a fun game that almost makes you need to find someone to show you how its played...

One of the very first games I bought to scratch the D&D with no DM itch. Long set up time and complex rules kinda killed it for me. That being said, it really is a cool game.

My all time favorite... I believe I have a copy of the first edition (perhaps missing some parts), and a complete copy of the second edition, sitting in my mothers attic. Good luck getting them back out of there again... You would have to take everything out of the attack, find the games, and then put it all back in there again, it would take a l o n g time, pluss she&#039;s in NY and I am in CA... Which is why I would buy it again, although how the hell I would play it much living in an RV I don&#039;t know...

Richard Hamblen is a true gaming visionary. His world construction alone created the tile laying genre (as used in Games like Settlers of Catan and Twilight Imperium) but that is only the surface of this game.   The game contains dozens of concise engaging mechanics subsystems for things as small as individual items or spells that odds are won't even make it into play (and yet never come across as unessential chrome).  

Magic Realm is my guilty pleasure from an era past (I *never* tire of it).  But in fairness unless you're playing with someone who has memorized every rule in the game it bogs down in a drudge of plotted turns, table references (this is a 1970's design), and simulation die rolls. i.e. most enjoyable when your expertise is high. (with 4 experienced players it takes about 15 minutes to set up and 2.5 hours to play).  I used to referee this game each year at GenCon (mostly in the 80's & 90's) too (so we may have played it together if you ever went to national Conventions). 

My play preference is minimal randomness (I like the more Eurogame-like solving of RPS puzzles) and thus don't care as much for advanced and optional combat rules.  Also I'm a strong advocate of quick playing realm designs (an inner cluster of woods and valleys surrounded by an outer ring of cave/mountain tiles)

It would be a challenge to learn the rules, and a tenfold challenge to find others willing to give it try, but by Odin, I'd be willing to try. It's like an enjoyable lesson in history of a field I'm actually interested in.

In the middle of a combat: "if you throw away your armor suit you can run and escape" "What?? How can I throw away my heavy armor suit in the middle of a combat?? I prefer to die fighting instead of doing such an unrealistic thing". And then I died.

Nevertheless, an interesting and rich game.

RATING: 10
Long game, with hard to understand rules, but has an absolutely WONDERFUL feel and flavor. It captures the fantasy theme very well. Unbelievably innovative for its time: the changing boards, quirky combat system, etc. Would like to try again with experienced players, but alas, that seems unlikely.
UPDATE: Have played several times over the last summer, and have discovered that it is even better than I remembered. The 3rd edition rules (available here at BGG) improve the game tremendously. 7->9
UPDATE: The theme pushes this over the top. 9->10

Too hard for most gamers. Too difficult to explain. Too many unneeded rules. Too long of a set up. Too easy to miss things. Poor execution. Too many design flaws.

Unique game. More than a game. It is like Dungeons and Dragons on a Settlers of Catan board. Nice art. Decent concepts. Fun when playing with people who are familiar with the game.

This is very similar to kingmaker in that the game itself is rather poor, but it is an awful lot of fun to play the beginning of the game. The fun is in the overall experience. As the game proceeds, it becomes dreary.

It says a lot about the design that it has a significant following after all this time. The artwork is marvelous and stands up very well. It certainly captured my imagination back in 1979.

The much-debated complexity of the game is a bit over-stated. The 1st-edition rulebook is nowhere near as bad as some say it is. 1st edition is better for learning, 2nd/3rd edition are better for reference & addressing the large number of marginal cases generated by the system.

The game is very unforgiving, something I enjoy but can be frustrating. I liken it to the arcade videogames of yore that would take your quarter, kill you, and taunt you for daring to play. It presents a challenge to overcome. Contrast this to modern videogames, where nothing must become too difficult, too quickly, lest it frustrate the gamer (who has invested ~240 quarters in the game up front...). It can also seem kind of dry at times, but pay attention and you'll find a game that's full of surprises, both big & small. Last but not least, it's very random for all its depth. So it ain't perfect, it apparently had a troubled development and some of the systems were not presented entirely as the designer intended. I wish campaigns played a bigger role, for example and I think the victory conditions could be better.

You have not played Magic Realm until you have played it with a group of experienced players. This is where the game truly shines; not solitaire, and not in learning games where everything crawls at a snail's pace. This is a problem, because merely learning the game is a challenge. Finding several experienced players is a challenge indeed. But a game of Magic Realm populated with players who know what they are doing with their characters really is a thing to behold. Mr. Hamblen has lovingly crafted a unique and thoughtful game; it has consistency, flexibility, and it doesn't put training wheels on the players or guard-rails on the narrative. Magic Realm is a very demanding game to *play*, because it's a damn fine game designed by a master, created to be a "gamer's game" (like all of Hamblen's designs). While it may appear to be a simple game of hiding & searching repeatedly until you are haplessly slaughtered by some Giant Bats, upon closer inspection there's a lot more going on in Magic Realm than meets the eye. Take a look at this 6-player game I was in a while back to see what I mean:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/627887/

It's the epitome of theme integration, depth, and emergent gameplay. The game is every bit as brilliant as Merchant of Venus, Gunslinger, or Victory in the Pacific. But, like another of my favorite games (Up Front), the work-to-payoff ratio is very high (especially at first) and it breaks with convention.

Any game that takes an hour to set-up will not get a score above 3.  We played the first of four introductory senarios and it took forever.  Historically, this game is a keeper due to it's daunting promise of recreating pen and paper roleplaying, otherwise it's completely unplayable with volumes of (useless) rules to pour over.

4/16/10:  I marvel at this game's ingenuity.  For those who have not played Magic Realm, it may be hard to imagine, but this game is nothing like Prophecy, Talisman or Runebound--it's so far beyond what these games have to offer that they're simply incomparable.  There is talk of how someone needs to make a simplified version of this game--someone has, and they're mentioned above.  In other words, you can't simplify this game.  The complexity is what leads to this game's enormous depth and variability.  In any event, I don't feel a lot of desire to play this game often, but, when I do, the game always delivers an experience that can't be obtained elsewhere (except maybe in a fantasy RPG).

2/16/08:  So I feel I've finally joined the ranks of people who understand this game.  It has been quite a journey.  You know, more than anything else, this game is the game version of Mount Everest.  You don't climb it because climbing it is fun - you climb it because it's the biggest mountain in the world and you relish the challenge.  For me, as a gamer, learning and understanding this game was more of an achievement rather than an investment in future fun playing the game.  In fact, after everything's been said and done, I can't really see myself returning to Magic Realm, except maybe for the occasional RealmSpeak adventure.  There is just far too much fun to be had in other games that don't exhaust me to play.  But, who knows?  Maybe, given some time, I'll change my mind again and have another go at it.  There is definitely more to explore with it (as I assume there always will be).

Earlier:  As far as I can tell, there are two kinds of complexity in gaming:  1) rules befuddled by a myriad of exceptions, and 2) rules built on extremely unfamiliar/counter-intuitive concepts.  Magic Realm is the latter, and it sure piles it on.  I spent a few months plodding through the rules and playing sample games with myself until I was finally able to play the second encounter with relative assurity that I wasn't skipping anything..whew.  I've still trying to decide whether the reward is worth the toil, which is a tough decision to make after only having experienced what amounts to about half of the game's flavor.  The experienced players will say that it's definitely worth it, but they've obviously made the ascent already.  For joe-gamer like me and you, it might not be.  In any event, my mind hasn't been made up, so I'll have to update here when I have more news.  Two quickies though:  the game is ruthlessly difficult to beat (at least so far) and the combat can be a little drawn out/boring if you and your adversary can't undercut each other.  The ability to hire natives and team up, as well as the appearance of magic, do seem quite intriguing though...  Anyway, if Magic Realm turns out to be too much game for your tastes, definitely check out Prophecy as an excellent entry in the same genre.

First sorry for my poor english so disregard some errors :)

If you enjoy a fantasy theme game it is a must play for you. This is not a game that you will learn in a few gameplays that is a game that you will lear in a big stepwise.
But what i have to say is: it really worth every minut that you spend learning! It is a tense game because you will have to take some risks somewhere when you play that can cause you lose the game but it is part of the fun.

But i tell you: it is really but really hard game to learn. I advise you that you get some tutuorials istead ready the game manual directly and play a lot the java version of the game following all your steps to learn the rules.

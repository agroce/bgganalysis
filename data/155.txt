This game was a lot of fun to play, even though it's quite a brain burner.  I like the aspect of having to conplete a contract after you select your hand.  Works very well.  Also the drafting of the cards is very unique.

One of the better trick taking games I've played. I'm not a huge fan of trick taking games where you have to predict the number of tricks that you will take since back when skills were handed out I failed to get any of that particular skill! But this one is different. Sure you have to do that on occasion but there are so many other choices with this game that that particular aspect gets diluted out in all the fun! Really a solid card game.

RATING: 6
Really nice trick taking game where you choose 4 goals and then you try to accomplish them one at a time. Excellent is the part where you pick your hand from the open cards on the table. The first to complete all 4 goals is the winner!

A clever twist on trick taking.  There is a novel system for drafting a hand of cards.  Objective chits are drawn at the start of play and the objective is to complete one each hand.  Despite all this cleverness, the gameplay feels fairly mundane.

As a trick-taking game, this offers some interesting ideas.  Drafting goals is a unique thing to do, as is drafting your hands without knowing what trump is.  However...I don't know.  I'd play again, but I wasn't super excited about it.

RATING: 4
A trick taking card game that is too tricksy for its own good.  When you finally play the tricks after the lengthy but dull process of drafting your hand, there's just no tension in the card play.  Maybe that's a 3-player game problem, with only two objectives in play, often diametrically opposed with both achievable, but I'm not sure that the extra player would add that much more to the game.

RATING: 6
For a trick-taking game it's quite a brainburner (maybe even too much for me). It's like an Oh Hell! without the randomness (cards are not dealt randomly but instead players pick them card by card). I think I actually like the lighter and more chaotic feel of the Oh Hell! more, especially since it's shorter and more dynamic. Here the drafting phase take a bit too long for me (actually it takes more than the trick-taking part).

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
The deduction element sounded like it would be interesting, but it seemed pretty easy to guess the trump color / number, and it really slows the game down.   It also felt like some of the goals were easier than others, but this is based on only playing once.   Some interesting elements, but felt like it WAY over stayed its welcome.  One of my least favorite trick takers.

After a bunch of half-games, I feel confident that this TT game is pretty stellar, if not a little longer than most. The little deduction at the beginning is clever. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Finally got this.  Now...to find others to play this with me.

Update:  Finally got two others to play this.  An excellent trick taking game.  First the draft of the cards and then the playing to go for your goals.  I wouldn't have considered trying this with anyone who isn't intimately familiar with trick taking games.  That base of knowledge HAS to be there.  I love tricking taking games and this is one of the better ones.  

Okay, second play with four, love the game.  Boosted it up to 8.5.  This will be my default trick taking game for three and for four, it will battle with Somerset. 

Love this.  Bumped to a 9.  Every time I play it, it gets better.  I like the drafting to what you are looking at going for.  It makes it interesting.  So much thought.

RATING: 6.5
Cool little game. I usually hate deduction games, but the part in this game that uses deduction has  such an easy answer in this one is usually pretty simple, so it really becomes a "build-your-own-hand" mechanism, which I really liked. The tricktaking itself was the average fun stuff (the individual objectives are nice, but nothing too incredible), so while it's an interesting game, I'd probably choose Tichu over this one most of the time.

I play it until someone completes all 4 objectives or up to 8 hands (then, the one with the most objectives win, with a tiebreaker to the one who completed his first objective first).

 The basic gist is you begin with the dealer secretly randomly selecting trump color and trump number and then laying out tricks. Player choose one card per trick and the dealer says who won it. Once each player has built their hand that way, trump is revealed and the game starts. Then players have to select one of 3 goals to complete except the dealer who has to choose one of the other players' goal. Then it's a normal trick taker. Crazy, crazy game and I can't wait to play again. Initial Rating: 8 but may change with more plays

RATING: 5
Not a huge fan of trick-taking games in general, since my brain is not good at predicting the outcome of tricks.  The card-drafting phase adds a deduction element, which would normally boost my appreciation, but because so little information is available in the beginning, it starts out as more of a random element and adds a significant chunk of time to the game.

Probably the most unique trick taker ever. It's an fantastic blend of deduction and trick taking. The tasks aspect makes deducing trump just as important as playing your hand well. And way the dealer completes tasks leads to some interesting strategies and can make for some good screwage. I have the feeling this one is going to become quite addictive.

This trick-taking game vaguely reminiscent of Mu includes a couple mechanics that I like.  At the very beginning, players can choose the different types of bids they want to make during the hands ("take no tricks," "take the last trick," etc.).  At the beginning of each hand, all the players select cards that are laid out in rows; only the dealer knows which suit and number are trump, and he tells players who would've won tricks if the cards being selected were played in one.  This game is a card-counter's delight; fortunately, most of my gaming friends don't have memory that's *that* good.  :P

A card game worthy of the man who made Die Macher.

Was Sticht is a singular experience to say the least. The deck is 4 coloured and 9 ranked. The dealer secretly finds out what the trump rank and colour is for the round, and then lays the deck out into a 9x4 grid, which players then draft their hands from. After each set of 4 cards is drafted, the dealer reveals who would have taken the "trick" of cards, and players try to deduce what the trumps are. After all of the cards are drafted, then the trumps are revealed, and the players choose one of their objective tiles to try to meet, these objective tiles are all drafted pre-game, and are typical card game objectives such as taking the most/least tricks, avoiding cards of a certain colour, &c. You then play the hand out. Anyone who meets their objective gets to discard it, running out of them wins you the game.

This is a very different card game, and quite challenging. Figuring out what the trumps are always takes a few drafts, and in particular card combinations, the mystery can linger well into the draft. Even once you know what the trumps are, one's strategy for drafting is not necessarily clear, and is driven largely by the objectives that you have to meet yet. Strangely, the actual card play, while still very important, feels like it takes a back seat to the card drafting process in this one.

In any case, very different. The draft makes the game go a shade longer than I would like, but the overall game rubs me the right way. It's different enough to deserve a spot in my collection. Only for experienced card players though, definitely.

I have to add, after trying it out this way, I prefer playing it with the "Play to 4 of 5 chits" rule, as that shortens the game up a skosh and fits it more comfortably into that hour time slot. I also prefer playing the 3 player game with a stripped deck instead of using the full thing. If you take out the 1's and 2's, the deck can be laid out in a 3 card grid with only one left-over. I prefer this to the full grid, discard the spare card from each trick system, because it keeps the colour distribution the same and makes the colour objectives about the same difficulty as they are in the 4 player game.

Production: The simplest of artistry with merely functional heft.  Play: A fun game of deduction during the card draft, and interesting hand assessment as players select which of their many goals to attempt with the hand they have just drafted, but the game has the potential to last forever if players are consistantly preventing each other from fulfilling goals.

Trick-taking card game, but with added twists.  There is a card draft element and 2 trumps (one number and one color).  The goals are hard to achieve and this lengthens the game significantly.  Overall, a decent game that probably requires several plays to become good at.  Not my favorite trick-taking card game, simply because of the AP from card drafting.

I prefer trick-taking games to be more straightforward than this one is. Without really enhancing the play, the bells and whistles add time and complexity --- eg, the slow reveal of trumps and, for that matter, the inclusion of a number trump as well as a color trump. I never have been a fan of the number trump, and this game didn't turn me into one.

Excellent Karl-Heinz Schmiel trick taking game. Players have to rid themselves of five objective chits to win (objectives are things such as "win 2 tricks", "win the last trick", "win no yellow", etc). The deck is dealt out into a 9 x 4 table and cards are acquired by the players to play the upcoming hand with. By following this process, players have to deduce trumps and customise their hand according to their goals. Lots going on, very clever game, and I'm pathetic at it. I like this one better than the vaunted Mu. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cards are drafted while everyone plays a guessing game to deduce trump suit and number.   The problem is that everyone arrives at the same conclusion at the same time, so in a way the game doesn't quite work.   Then you have to decide which of your "mission" chips to aim for.  This part of the game makes it interesting, however.  If you consider the game has drafting of goals, drafting of cards, deduction of rules, and then playing out the tricks...   well, the game was certainly ahead of its time.

RATING: 6
A build-your-own-hand trick-taking game. Players draft their cards from a common area in order to complete individual tasks they also selected for themselves. Huh, I can hear you say, you choose both your goals and your hand, isn't that a bit easy? Well, yes and no. The drafting mechanism and possibly contradictory goals make completing them quite a bit harder in practice than it sounds in theory.

However, it does seem awfully hard to sabotage other players on purpose as long as you still want to complete your own task, so simply choosing the right task at the right time (right, this is done secretly and simultaneously) is much more important than it should be.

The first time or two I played this brain-mashing devil of a game, I was at a total loss.  It just seemed way too difficult.  Once I stopped trying to memorize what was in each of the other players' hands, the game started clicking.  It's a fascinating game that requires careful concentration, but it usually feels a little too long; I prefer playing to four chits rather than five.  Also, the tiebreaker numbers on the different chits are not properly balanced, especially with three players (but that's a very minor complaint).

great trick taking game with a deduction phase when you try to figure out the trump number and suit.  Also has little task chits that have goals that you must fulfill. (like, take no tricks, take the last trick, take the most tricks, or take no green cards).  Winner is the one who gets rid of their 5 task chits by fulfilling them as a regular player, or, when the dealer, fulfilling someone else's task while keeping them from fulfilling it.  mm mmmm good!

「究極のトリテ」とか「トリテなのに重ゲー」というような評判を聞いていたので想像を逞しくしていたが、思ったよりずっとシンプルなゲームでシステム的に新しいところはなく、トリテとしてトリッキーなルールは何一つ出てこない。
が、その組み合わせの妙は古き良きドイツゲームが持つそれである。
一人だけが切り札スート及び切り札数字を知っている状態でロチェスタードラフトをする。そして、その後普通にトリテをする。各自の目標を達成できれば勝利に近づく。これだけのゲームである。
しかし、強烈に面白い。

1st played 1/14/08. Taught in 5 min, played in ~75min w/ 4 players. Played with "Mü & Lots More". This trick-taking game has its own luck/strategy mix. Object is to achieve 4 goals from cards chosen before playing. Goals examples: take majority of cards, take none, take no blue/red/black/yellow cards (yet take at least one trick), etc. Goals are harder than you think & can become somewhat of a stalemate towards the end if everyone is trying to take no tricks for example. Deck cards 4 suits & range 1-9. 2 trumps (color & number; either can be no trump), dealer draws 1 of each & looks at them. All cards are placed face up in groups of 4. Players choose cards & rotate selection order. The dealer informs all the winning card selected (from same order selected) & others deduce what are trumps. Everyone secretly picks a goal (except dealer) of their 1-4 cards remaining after confirmation of trumps. Finally a trick-taking round begins after everyone shows their goal. Goal cards are discarded after making the goal. Dealer discards any card if someone else fails a goal & dealer succeeded. Very engaging & quite fun. Highly recommend (if you know someone who has it); however I'd suggest playing a round before starting over so you have a feel for what to do.

This is an interesting trick taking game in which goal cards are initially selected. Then cards are played onto the table and drafts occur in which the dealer knows the color and number that are the trumps. You try to figure out the trumps to help in card selection. Next you select a rule to play for. Then compete to take the number of tricks that will meet the rule. If you fail and the dealer meets your rule he gets your goal card.

But I like how you can choose your tasks and how you as the dealer can try to mess with the other players (as in Die Sieben Siegel).  The main problem with the game for me is the playing time - it seems to stretch out a little past its welcome.  If I could get the play time down I think this would be a fun trick-taking staple.

An excellent combination of deduction, card selection and trick-taking game.  Early on, you need to deduce what the trump(s) is(are) and choose cards wisely according to your goals.  Once that part is resolved, trump(s) are revealed and you choose a and play out the hand.  Dealer has try to be spoiler and saboteur.  Some may prefer this to be shorter which can be easily revised to 3 out of 4 goals (instead of the normal 4 of 4).

RATING: 8
One of my favorite card games due to the intricacies of the game.  First, everyone selects 4-5 goals which the first to complete will then win the game.  Second, the aspect of the dealer knowing trump color and the trump number and the deduction element for the remaining players in the game as one attempts to figure out trump and set oneself up to complete a goal.  Dealer does not get to select own goal but seeks to complete on of the opponents' goals and wreck that opponent to be able to put goal of choice from their personal stock as completed.  Third, normal card play aspect with trump and trump color.  All in all, excellent game but it sure takes some time.

A wonderful trick-taking game that incorporates the meta-gaming aspect into the real game, i.e. you are not trying to win the most trick, but rather trying to achieve various goals. The rule about dealer's goal is brilliant - the dealer knows the trumps from the beginning, but does not get to choose his own goal; he has to achieve one of the other players, and succeeds only if he/she achieves it while the other player fails. A must for anyone who likes trick-taking games.

A good trick taking game that would come out more often except that it takes too long and it only plays with 3 or 4, and the 3 player version is not nearly as good. Each player chooses 5 goals to win on various hands (least tricks, most tricks, no yellow cards, exactly 2 tricks, last trick, etc). First player to achieve all their goals wins. On each hand, each player declares their stated goal, and the dealer attempts to stop them being met. Each player actually chooses their hand card by card from a display whilst gradual information is being deducted on the colour trump and number trump, so if you can track it all, perfect information is available. Good luck though. What I like about it is that every hand is a battle - choosing, deducting, tracking, playing.

Interesting concept for a trick taking game, namely picking one's own tasks and the cards to accomplish them.  Too much of a brain burner for me, methinks.  Now, back to Cosmic Eidex....  Math traded.

I get to play this at my local meetup today in it's new 2007 edition (4 mini games in 1 box) and I have to say this game is for advance trick taking game players.

The memory and deduction aspect is fun but also draining after a while. The game felt 1 goal card too long. I didn't complete any goal card might have contributed to the sourness toward the game.

RATING: 6
Takes the trick-taking genre to the next level in that if you have a good number memory of the cards players have picked,you are more informed in your decision making rather than speculating. This takes out some of the tension but adds on the brain power. I just don't have that kind of mental wiring, despite finding the preliminary trump deduction phase interesting. But then I realise this adds yet another layer of tactics and strategy. Too clever for me to be enjoyable.

One for trick-taking connoisseurs as it's weird! Features drafting of goals at the beginning of the game, and then drafting of each hand in a semi-deductive process where only one player knows the trumps. Bizarre but brilliant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Too tedious for my taste. Figuring out the trumps while picking the cards is not that interesting, since random picks (before there being any information on the trumps) typically reveal a lot and those picks might already have had a big impact on the and.

RATING: 7
This is in reference to the Mü & Lots More version.

Best played when you're feeling jaded about trick taking games in general, but not to be played too frequently.

The most unique part of the game is the most tedious: the card drafting at the beginning of the game. (It's actually quite tedious to deal 36 cards in four rows of nine, in comparison to traditional trick taking games in which you simply deal the deck out to players.) There are meaningful and tricky decisions to make during this phase, and the card drafting mechanism ensure that it's hard to draft a perfect hand. It is fun to build your hand of cards based on one of your objectives that you want to accomplish (like taking the last trick or taking a majority of tricks), It's particularly challenging for the dealer who has to build a hand based on his opponent's objectives.

However, opportunities to make strategically significant decisions during this phase do not happen frequently. Each player, during this phase, drafts from four cards. This is repeated nine times. But as with most card drafting games, as cards are picked, players going later in turn order have less to pick from than those ahead. So each player (other than the dealer in a 4 player game), has a choice among 4 cards only twice, but each player is stuck "choosing" 1 card twice as well. It would have been a bit more interesting if players could better manipulate their opponents' hands.

Unfortunately, the card drafting part weakens the excitement of the trick-taking phase. Because the cards drafted by each player is open knowledge, during the trick taking phase, all players know what all the other players are holding in their hands -- provided that they can remember. This is easier done than said since like many trick taking games, it's important to simply remember the number of cards in each suit and where the high cards are.

A trick-taking game I enjoy! The first part (picking cards) is sort of like Zendo (as Maks mentioned), and then you get to pick which of your goal tiles you'll go for. It's fun and clever.

I'm a bit of a fan of trick taking games that break themselves into two halves as you weigh up the strength of your hand. Here you have (perhaps the illusion of) control of building your hand from the ground up to suit your ambitions. That appeals to me. While you're building up your hand you're looking at what your opponents are grabbing and remembering what goals they're trying to achieve. Factor all that into your selection. Then the playing of cards begins. It's a good challenge and worthy of repeated plays.

An interesting trick taking game where you get to pick the cards you want and also decide which 5 tasks you want to try to complete during the game. Largely language independent except for the task chips but they can be recreated. See my German to English rule translation and task chip recreation in the files section for this game. An overlooked game, likely a result that it's from a German publisher.

There is a lot of stuff packed into this game. It is a fantastic asymmetrical induction drafting trick taking game.  In fact it is probably the best asymmetrical induction drafting trick taking game ever created.  

This is a little confusing at first, and if you aren't prepared to grog this it will be too much for some. Certainly, this isn't for casual gamers. It is so individual though that it is worth the twisty learning curve to see how this plays out.  Perhaps a little long as it technically can go indefinitely.  I'd like to play this till someone fulfills four of the five requirements.

based on 3 plays, GREAT!  Trick-taking with different missions where you bid for you hand.  Wonder if it might not be more interesting to take an extra "mission" so your final goal might remain a mystery, otherwise it seems like the dealer has a slight advantage if they know one or more actual goals needed to win.

RATING: 8
Clever trick-taking game with an unusual level of control. Before each round, players draft their initial starting hand using a novel mechanism that progressively reveals which colours/numbers are trump, then nominate one of their goal cards ("score the least tricks", "win the last trick" etc.). If they fulfill the goal then they get a point. 

Card games which claim ever-increasing novelty tend to be chaotic, but Was sticht? is [i]less[/i] random than most. Great little gamer twist on a classic genre.

[Moskito Spiele 1994 edition] {trick-taking, bidding, drafting, deduction; optimal 4p} WS is a unique trick-taking game with the task chips, deduction and card-choosing mechanics. WS is very fun and moderately confrontational. There is a lot of player interaction.

However, the game is not intuitive and takes time to explain. Besides, it's not available in English and players have to refer to the translation for the tasks chips (though it's easy).

Rating after only one play.  Could go up if I ever got the hang of it.
If I had a photographic memory I'd probably love it.  I can barely handle the card counting required in a normal trick-taking game; but this game, with it's wildly varying hand victory conditions and it's card drafting mechansim, requires almost perfect card counting skills to play well. 
I would say this is only for experienced trick taking players.  It's too difficult for casual players.

This is an overly complicated trick-taker with some novel concepts.  The dual trumps are a real pain and make the game more complex than it needs to be.  I also don't care for the drafting portion.  It just felt too cumbersome for my tastes.  I did enjoy the goal cards which put a lot of emphasis on the draft.  I'd still prefer it to be done differently.

Nice trick taking game. Diferences with similar games: at the beginning of each round you don`t become cards, you choose cards (so you built your deck for the round).

Before the game you choose 5 goals, and before every round you choose your goal for the round. Because of this every round could be for you diferent (in one you wan`t to collect less tricks, in another 3 tricks an so one

Cool elements of sabotage and a little bit of deduction make this something I want to go back to. A top-tier TT game for me except for its long play time.

Awesome trick taking game. You draft your hand & then play it out trying to accomplish your four goals. The mechanics guiding this are fantatic. The way everyone is in each round of a trick taking game makes this shine.

2007-06-13: This is a brilliantly designed trick-taking game.  First, everyone drafts their 5 tasks they must complete for victory.  Then the game begins.  The dealer is the only one who knows the trump number and color (if there are any) before the Rochester card draft begins.  He must announce after each trick's worth of cards is taken which drafted card would have won that trick, giving the other players the opportunity to deduce what trumps are.  After all the cards are drafted, the trumps are revealed - though by then, it is usually not a surprise.  Then everyone but the dealer selects a task to complete - the dealer has to complete someone else's task, without that player also completing the task.  So, the dealer has the most control over how trumpy his drafted cards are, but zero control over his goal - psychological trickery aside, of course.  Then the tricks are played out.  Oh, the balance!

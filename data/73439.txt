Game seemed impenetrable from reading the rules.  Sort of clicked in the second round and seems like a great game.  I really like how the dice rolling is incorporated, plus the secret roles, the random trader cards giving game variety and the way the attacks on the city come in.  Lots to like.  Brain-burning.
First game took us 4 hours.

Second game, 2 players. Still felt brain-burning. But worked well as a two player. I'm starting to wonder if it is too heavy for me.  Mainly because it feels like there are too many choices/options each turn.

A game of set rounds set in the city of Troyes and utilizing a very unique dice action selection mechanism.

Each round you gather a die (the die have different colours and can be used for different regions of the board, religious, civil, and military) for each person you have in one of 3 different cities and roll them.  These dice will be used to perform several different actions: make money, add presence to the cathedral (scores points and influence), fight the marauders (scores points and influence), add more people to cities (therefore get more dice and thus more actions later), add people to building cards (scores end game points and allows access to a wide variety of abilities).  There are a couple of interesting twists with the dice selection: you can purchase other people's die, thereby taking their actions for your own in essence, you can also re-roll or "flip" bad rolls into good ones paying with influence (another currency effectively).  Therefore you can win with lots of dice or little, with "bad" rolls or good ones.  Money is tight, so passing is another option and you generate income this way similar in fashion to the Amyitis.

Each round you also have to as a group, fight the marauders to a limited extent and quite likely weather the storm of their attacks (some negative penalties)- it therefore gives incentive to the action of fighting the marauders.  Each player is secretly assigned an end game point-scoring character card (based on end game conditions) that all players can potentially score for so you need to keep an eye on what other players are focusing on.  

This game scales very well from 2-4 players and has alot of moving parts and is truly a strategy gamer's game.

Own the [boardgame=94284]bonus cards[/boardgame] and the [boardgame=127061]Ladies of Troyes[/boardgame] expansion.  The Ladies of Troyes expansion adds the following (which can be modular if you wish): a purple die for each player which cannot be purchased and which can be used as ANY colour, there are 3 new end game persons, there is a variant rule for adding an additional person face up for all players to be able to target for scoring, there are several new building and marauding cards, and there are the outdoor activities.  The outdoor activities allow for a new action which is the movement of your tower guard around the castle and when he reaches an activity, he has access to it which provides abilities and/or scoring opportunities- this action is very useful and powerful and should not be overlooked.  The expansion does not contain alot of materials but it increases the variability and replayability of an already great game so I definitely recommend it.

130929 I like the game, but its a bit fiddly. I find teaching the game kind of annoying cause you do need to cover a lot of ground.  I typically like elegant games which this is not, but still its currently a guilty pleasure.

110706 Light enough for me to really enjoy but meaty enough to hold my interest.  I think this will be a keeper for a while.  Maybe not top of top of the line, but great game non the less (and its the only worker placement game I have...well I guess I have 'gric).  And very nice consistent clean art.

Really, really like this game.  Unfortunately I expect this to peak and then dip eventually...but until then I'm bumping it to a 9.

My favourite Euro. Luck plays its part in the die rolls - as it should - but not so much that it can make victory impossible. Iconography exists only to remind you that the French are different, and that difference is good. Buy it, steal it, make your own, just make sure you play it.

There is dice rolling though not too much luck. Very clever game and what seems like a tonne of re-playability due to the limited number of cards per game and the various ways they will all interact in combination. Great blind victory conditions to be figured out from your opponents moves. Top gamer's game and look forward to playing again. Decent addition to the collection.

Really begs to be played as a 3 player. Does not work as a 2 player, 4 player is ok. Luck factor is interesting, since you can buy dice so freely from each other purely dice rolls actually is probably a lesser factor than what card happen to come up on different turns. Card turns can swing the game rather a lot. That said one good roll combined with turn order (say the first player in a round getting double sixes) can potentially break the game wide open in an unpleasant way.

Long rules explanation and initially unintuitive gameplay present a barrier to newcomers - this is a game you have to work at, if you are going to get to grips with it. But it's worth it. The decisions involved are deep. Interaction can stifle your plans but there is always an alternate strategy you can employ. The artwork is excellent and the use of dice is very cleverly integrated. A great game.

RATING: 8
3 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: The interaction of buying and manipulation of the dice is intricate and satisfying. Players can plan to use dice for a big move, or to protect their meeple from being pushed out. The push and pull of the dice resources is a bit conflicting, but not terrible, since players can buy other player's dice. I also enjoyed the secret, yet shared, end game goals, because it's fun to try to guess what each player has.

DISLIKE: High price tag, not much physical content in the box. The dice can be random and work against players. Lots of little rules for each of the events, but not a hinderance.

OVERALL: Very good game because of the interactivity. The game can have a very slight meanness to it, but this is very minor and keeps the game interesting.

A fascinating game with a wide variety of set ups which makes for very likely a different strategy each time. The dice mechanic here is quite unique although a touch clunky in the calculations for buying dice. Also this one is very prone to analysis paralysis since each of your dice can be taken and opportunities closed off. Yet a game that sticks with you - challenging and engaging. I like it!

Tras varias partidas, el juego me ha encantado, me gusta todo! Escala bien de 2-4, quizá ideal con 3. Funciona también perfecto a 2.

Muchos dados que se adquieren con meeples colocados, que lanzan y dejan en reserva cada jugador en centro tablero. Con esos dados tuyos (o compras los de otros), puedes realizar multiples acciones, para conseguir más dados, prestigio, PV, etc. Si, dados, influye el azar, pero vale mucho más como planeas las acciones y siempre que tengas influencia puedes relanzar alguno: dependiente de la suerte pero para nada determinante y le sienta genial al juego. Quizá las cartas de evento esté un poco OP de PV que otorgan. Duración contenida, si bien al principio puede generar mucho AP y el tema de la "división" a primerizos les cuesta. 
En general, muy buen euro, que no se parece tanto a otros, chapeau!

I can honestly say that Troyes stands out artistically, mechanically, and even to a certain extent, thematically from all other games in my collection. It is an excellent game whose designers and artists have gone on to make a few other games I find to be interesting and unique as well such as Ginkopolis and Bruxelles but neither are as good as when, "the whole band was together" and made Troyes. Play it. Love it. You won't regret it.

The advantage of the 2nd player is just to much to make it a really good game. The mechanics are quite nice but the imbalance between the positions keeps it from reaching a decent score.

I *really* want to like this one, but the different paths are illusory.  There's an optimal path in the available options and if you don't take it you're in trouble and way behind those who do.  That's just not good enough.  Still, it's a fun game and I like it.  I really want to find some house rules that fix these things.  There's a great core to it, just needs some balancing/touch up.

This has long been on my "Want to try list", and I finally got to play it. I've been looking for a good euro-style game that involved dice. This was great. I felt like I pulled off some great combos, I was able to build a money engine out of the cards available, and the elements of the game just fit together well.

I would never play this with somone who was AP prone, as the decision tree for each move is huge, but for my game group, it's an excellent game. It's going on my breakup list I think.

Outstanding engine building and dice management game.

A lot of depth with a limited number of decisions. As a result, the game plays fast if no one suffers from analysis paralysis.

Replayability is through the roof, and the wonderful expansion Ladies of Troyes, while absolutely not needed, brings even more goodness.

The game is very interactive, with unusually direct boot kicking for this type of euro. Nevertheless, no take that per se.

The art is original and I love it, but not everybody will. Theme is thin, this is a mechanics first game, with a nice arc from early, mid and end-game. As a result, theme-first gamers may find Troyes quite dry.

Very interested in playing this more to fully explore the design. Won my initial game at BGG.CON (a squeaker!) and absolutely love the decisions surrounding the use of dice. It seems best to think of dice not as your own in the sense that you are going to get to use them, but rather as potential, either for cheap dice placement or for gold when people pay you to use them. 

Ladies is an interesting expansion, I didn't think I was actually going to like the purple die as it seemed like it would rob the game of some tension, but it actually allows for some measure of interesting decisions, and all the additional cards are great (e.g. I think trebuchet is a much more balanced card than archers). Doubling the potential scoring categories makes for a much more tense finish, some in the group have expressed that it makes it feel a little too much like a crapshoot, and I can agree to some degree, but it also means you REALLY need to pay attention to what everyone else is doing.

RATING: 5
I'm not sure what it is about Troyes that bugs me.  It does a lot of things right, has innovative mechanics, and plays in a reasonable amount of time.  At the same time, it can be somewhat random (certain remaining dice -will- get all your workers bumped off their buildings, and then you burn resources and other awkwardness while you try and recover) and the iconography is a disaster.  Worse, it is often surprisingly unintuitive and surprisingly fiddly.  While I'll play it sometimes, the lack of a theme and the "meh"-ness of the game as a whole put it pretty far down the list.

You know, I liked it, but our first play felt awfully long, with eight rounds and 18 dice to spend. There's an interesting bit of gamesmanship in trying to determine your opponent's scoring card. But really, the core of the game is in the dice and the use of them. It's not really more complex than Kingsburg, but it feels a lot more meaningful. There are a lot of options here, with battling events, trade cards, principal buildings, etc., as opposed to Kingsburg, in which your options are pretty well constrained by your dice and there is often a "clear" "best option". Troyes will have some AP for this, which extends the game, but I think otherwise it's well-balanced, with some mechanisms (namely, buying dice) that really bring something to the table. Also, there is a downside in combo (or trade) spamming, in which a single trade card will get throttled all game, essentially eliminating the variability from the other trade cards.

There's a lot going on in Troyes.  Combine that with a new set of icons to learn and a fresh twist of the allocate dice to do stuff genre and there's a bit of a learning curve.  Get beyond that and you'll find a game that challenges you to make the best use of three resources -  dice, money and influence - and gives you a variable set of tools (the various profession cards) to play with.  My one concern is that some combinations are very powerful.  The last game I played was a first encounter with the Monk + Sculptor juggernaut.  The end result wasn't close. 

I rather like the Medieval-style artwork.  The production quality is excellent.

If you like to thinks of countless optimizations models in a game quite heavily dependent on luck (dice) than this might just be your cup of tea.

When it comes to dice in my euros, no game does it better than Troyes.  I also love the whole presentation of this game.  Except, I HATE the purple dice added in the Ladies expansion!  Throws off the whole visual feel such that I can't properly enjoy the game.  Crazy, yes!  But its the truth.

RATING: 8.4
I rate this highly because it has many paths to victory, varied options as to what you can do on your turn and a unique triggering mechanic, all pluses.

At-start, place your five meeples on one of three buildings, which are color coded.  Gain dice  (also color coded) corresponding to the buildings your meeples occupy to activate special abilities of cards or fight events.

However, you aren't confined to using your own dice.  At a monetary cost, you can purchase the dice of the other players; so, the game has a nice screwage factor, which is another plus.  In addition, dice can be used to bump other players off the various tracks, blocking their progress in relation to the Activity Cards in those areas.

You must also manage an influence track, influence enabling players to place meeples from their supply, re-roll or simply change die values.

The event cards also trigger the game's attacking of the players, so attention must be paid to what the game is going to do to thwart your plans, as well.

only 4 plays so far, but this is one of the best out there. The art is amazing and unique, and adds a lot to the theme. I was originally ignoring Troyes because of the dice, but it works so well! The luck factor is very small, its all about your choices and skill. 

Very good combination of beautiful art, interesting and flawless mechanics, great replayability, and novelty (story arc)

November 2011:  Fiddly and chock full of gratuitous mechanics that feel like they should have been edited out.  This game just feels very weak-themed and artificial in its presentation and execution. Rating 6 of 10.

January 2013:  Roll dice, stare at pips on many dice, add pips on dice, perform division on pips in order to perform differential VP analysis on cards, buy dice, have your dice bought, have meeples randomly knocked off of their placements by randomized card effects, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, and then repeat again, for 2 hours.  Paper over this endless dice analysis "game" with medieval theme that just doesn't feel connected to all the dice analysis. 

This game is so clearly much ado about nothing...except of course, rolling dice, and rolling more dice, and analyzing the results of those dice rolls in order to earn VP's...for two hours.  Waste of time.  Downgrading to 3 of 10 based upon sheer annoyance.

A neat game which uses dice and cards but feels more strategic than random. In a way it feels like a suped-up version of Stone Age where you use dice to activate various areas (rolling for resources in Stone Age), and depending on the value of the dice determines the amount of times you activate the card's action. Can be frustrating at times (with players buying dice from under you) and luck does appear in terms of you rolling high (your dice get stolen) and your opponents rolling low (no point in buying their dice). Despite these problems still a lot of fun!

Eurogame seco donde los haya. Nada intuitivo en su aprendizaje y con el tema pegado hasta el absurdo. Los dados no funcionan como tales y realmente da igual los números que muestren porque cualquiera puede utilizar los tuyos en su provecho. Es necesario conocer los combos y las cartas previamente y por ello la primera partida es desconcertante.
Mezcla mecánicas de otros muchos juegos y nos han vendido el tema de los dados como una genialidad... cuando realmente es un pegote más.

RATING: 5
I was modestly impressed with Georges' first two offerings, Royal Palace and Carson City.  Combined with the ratings, I figured this to be a hit for me.  It seems to me that things were arbitrarily added to the design (Need more stuff?  How about attackers?  And moving the cards from right to left?) with an end result of a surprisingly clunky-to-play Euro.  The decision tree is large, and I found the downtime between turns uninteresting as dice-stealing was the only action that seemed to meaningfully impact my choices.  I presume that a second play would go faster, but I'm not very interested in one.  It's probably just the look, but it makes me want to revisit Caylus.

Alongside Trajan and Bruxelles 1893, Troyes comprises the trinity of my favorite Euro games. From the beautiful Alexander Roche artwork to the intricate dice rolling and Activity placement, every part of this machine is so well greased for performance, and there is much to think about when establishing a strategy. Do you focus on combating Events, to rid you of their debilitating effects, or do you go for construction...the game just rules.

Troyes has some cool ideas, like pushing other players' workers off buildings and collectively fighting the events with black dice.  I also like the artwork, although the symbols that explain what the action cards do are not very easy to understand.

What I'm really, really confused about is why the designers of Troyes chose to use dice in their game.  What's the point of rolling dice if you can easily purchase better dice from your opponents or manipulate your own?  I feel like half the rules are just there to offset the randomness of the dice, and it really defeats the "make the best of what you have" mentality that make other dice games, like Kingsburg, work.

The game is heavier, more abstract, and cube-pushier than I'd expected, but still quite worthwhile. Plays better with four than with two, though I suspect that three will be the sweet spot. Needs to be played at least twice to get a good feel for the gameplay; new players are simply lost within it. Replay value is looking good with the many different event and activity cards, where especially different activity cards manage to make each game have a distinct feel.

¿Un juego de dados donde casi no hay suerte?. Esto hay que probarlo. Troyes es un juego estupendo, terriblemente elegante en sus mecánicas y con un arte en tableros y cartas muy inmersivo. 
Cada partida se juegan con 9 cartas de tres mazos distintos elegidas ala azar de entre otras muchas al inicio de la partida. Eso otorga  durabilidad al juego. 
La idea es buscar la interacción entre estas cartas para poder usarlas correctamente y sacar el máximo beneficio  al combo. Cada jugador intentará hacer lo mismo y de hecho habrá un par o tres combinaciones buenas así que el que mejor se adapte al devenir del juego será el vencedor.

Las reglas, una vez captada la esencia, son muy sencillas y se puede introducir a no jugones empezando a jugar diractamente, sin explicación previa. Una vez visto el primer turno las mecánicas son tan sencillas que lo que queda es saber jugar con las cartas y el puteo que puedas ocasionar (se dice pronto, pero eso es otro cantar).

Tendría que jugarlo más. Con esta frase ya te lo digo todo.

For a game with so much supposedly at your disposal (which, by the way, is not something I tend to appreciate), what you can actually do is fairly limited. You might not be entirely at the mercy of lady luck, but small mistakes can be very costly, leaving you out of any considerable good actions quickly in the very long turns. I might play again in person, with someone telling me what I'm doing wrong, but I doubt this one will rise in my appreciation considerably.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Place meeples to decide what dice you'll get, roll the dice to decide what actions will be available to you, use money or influence to mitigate the luck of the roll by buying dice from other players or changing your own. Player interaction is high.

It is a tactical game: what you do each turn depends on your rolls, and on the event and action cards that get turned up. The cards make for interesting game variability but also means it is slow to teach – you'll have to explain to newbies all cards each time they come up, and it is not always easy to appreciate their worth.

I've played with two, three and four players, it works well at all counts. The cards, board and dice look lovely.

RATING: 8
The best debut game from a company I can recall.  The best deep (gamer’s game) dice game I can think of, even ahead of Yspahan.  The choice of which dice to use is tense, knowing the ones you don’t chose will probably be gone by the time you have another turn.  The cost of using your opponents’ dice is well pitched.  The adequate income means you can survive with few dice.  Alternatively invest in more dice by bringing in new workers, but forgo current actions.  The restriction on expelling existing workers - not more than one of an opponent's from each location, is also pitched well, as is the method with either direct replacement or a queuing system depending on the location.  There are so many other nice and original ideas it was a delight to play.  Probably my favourite and the most original Essen 2010 game, even ahead of Civilisation, 7 Wonders and Key Market.  Looking forward to further plays. Recommended.

Always love dice as workers mechanism, very dry and a bit boring looking but it's such a great game. so many ways to use the dice and score points. Great balance between scoring points and using dice to place workers on buildings so you still have dice next turn.

Love the secret end game mechanism

RATING: 7
Először is, örülök, hogy végre kipróbálhattam, az idei esseni kínálatból a top3 várományosaim egyike volt ez a játék (a 7 wonders és a sid meiers civ. mellett). Nem csalódtam, pedig magam sem tudom, miért vártam ennyire ezt a játékot. Mondhatjuk, hogy pusztán a képek alapján. Nagyon szépnek tűnt a tábla, a doboz... A játék során vita alakult ki, 2:2 arányban tartottuk szépnek ill. csúnyának a játékot. A legszebbek szerintem a kártyák, így amikor már mind a 9 akciókártya fenn van, akkor a legszebb a játék.

Na de rátérve a lényegre: A 90 perces játikidő egy vicc. Tisztán 3 óra volt a játék, és állítólag ez nem egyedi eset, hanem általános. Ami nekem alapból nem tetszett, az lehet, hogy szőrszálhasogatás, de 4 személy esetén 2 ember 2-szer kezd, a másik kettő meg csak egyszer. Az épületekben a helyért fizetni kell, így végső soron nem túl nagy előny, amihez jut valaki azáltal, hogy több kockával dobhat. Ha csak 1 kockát akarok használni az akciómban, gyakran ugyanannyiért vehetem meg, mint amennyit a tulajdonosa a dobásért fizetett (ráadásul ő akciót is áldozott rá). Szóval szerintem túl van kompenzálva a dobás lehetőségének elvesztése. Ami még nem tetszik, és lassan a végére is érek a negatívumoknak, hogy a végső 6 bónusz-szerzési lehetőségből elég lutri, hogy melyikek szerepelnek a játékban. Oké, lehet sejteni abból, hogy ki mire gyúr, de mégis, túl sok múlik ezen, ahhoz, hogy így derüljön ki. Ja még egy furcsaság: van egy mező a játékban, ahol pénzt lehet szerezni akcióként: ezt senki sem használta. Volt jobb mező. Talán van olyan eset, amikor szükség lehet rá, de még nem találkoztam olyannal, aki használta. Ez azért elég nagy tesztelési hiba.

A játékban szerintem egyébként nagyon nagy újrajátszhatósági lehetőségek rejlenek. Elég kreatívan nyúltak a kockás témához, teljesen másra jó a fehér kocka, mint a piros, talán kicsit gyengének érzem azt a funkciót, amivel embert helyezhetünk el az épületekben, a fentebb írtak miatt (könnyű pótolni a kimaradó kockadobásokat). A presztízspontok is tetszenek. Elég konfrontatív a játék, de számomra ez belefér. A játék nem vészesen komplex, pont az élvezhetőség határán mozog. Nem annyira egzakt, mint mondjuk a Caylus, nem lesz a top10-emben, de elég eredeti, szívesen játszanék vele bármikor!!!

Még egy megjegyzés: ez inkább taktikai, mint stratégiai játék, bár kell egy vezérfonal, de mivel nincs biztonságban a kockánk a többiektől, ezért a pillanatnyi helyzet dönt.
---
Másodjára játszva én készültem a szabályból: bonyolultabbra emlékeztem:) Meglepően rövid, egyszerű és letisztult, nincs sok kivétel. A játék komplexitásának java részét a kártyák adják szerintem, azok nincsenek a szabályban, külön lapra kerültek.
---
A harmadik játék után kicsit rontottam a pontszámon. Minden oké a játékkal, de azért nem ad pl. Macao, Notre Dame vagy Pillars of the Earth szintű élményt... Márpedig eddig ugyanannyi ponton állt, mint a felsoroltak.

One of the most beautiful games I have played.  the art is really fantastic.  The game itself is extremely original, even though I have tried it almost 4 years too late.  The use of dice is simply great, and offers really a lot of options.  Luck is involved, but there are so many ways to overcome bad luck that I doubt it can play a significant role in the final result.
It is a kind of game I actually don't manage well, because it has a lot of info on the board, and this is difficult for me, but this is absolutely a personal problem.  The game is clear, and flows fine, although sometimes AP can appear easily.
Besides, it has quite a few different cards to mix, making really a lot of different playing conditions, so replayability is absolutely ensured.
Really good, wanting to play again to try to make better.

An excellent worker placement/action management game that is nothing like kingsburg. I don't have a clue why people compare the two. The strategies and gameplay differ completely.

A very good game overall, and also the expansion is great.

I can see the gears of this game turning a bit too clearly, which is usually not a problem for me in eurogames. There are a lot of calculations involved; moves that precariously depend on having exactly the right amount of resources available.

Usually mechanics wound up this tightly do not feature dice! Overlooking some minor detail is extremely easy, and can cost you dearly. The game does get better the more you play, but I still can't entirely shake off the feeling of Troyes being just one big math homework exercise.

Worker placement with dice. Although this is the same mechanic already seen in Kingsburg, this is a whole next level in this genre.
There's three different colours of dice, each with its own characteristics, and every color is absolutely different from others.
There's different action cards every game, and that's added value for replayability.
Every dice can be modified, and every player can even use dice from other players!
The first game has been completely opaque, in the sense that no one understood more than a small percentage of what he did... but under the opacity I saw the glimpse of a masterpiece!

The one thing that this game lacks is a part of the game in which low numbers work better than high ones. As it is you always want to roll as high as possible and if you have low dice rolls then you probably have no chance winning. The other problem is that when playing with people who tend to have P/A the game will probably be very long.

On the plus side the game feels very euro-ish, players have lots of decisions to make, many options to deal with their dice rolls and there is some negative interaction.

RATING: 9.5
Like Ginkgopolis, this is a game that takes a number of mechanisms and mixes them in an interesting way. The dice rolling is satisfying and the action selection/worker placement hybrid mechanism is quite good. Once you get used to the game, you'll have a fun game that plays smoothly even with people that agonize over their dice selection.

The base game has great replayability despite being fairly limited in the scope of its actions. It was quite surprising to find how differently each game plays. The replayability is largely due to the action and event cards that get turned over throughout the game. The game even provides a hint of narrative through those aforementioned cards. 

For some negatives, it can play a bit longer as you learn the game. I've found the rulebook to be overly condensed, which makes learning the game a bit more difficult than other rulebooks of games with a similar weight. The first few games are slowed further due to the iconography being non-intuitive. This game should have just put the text on the cards instead of going for language independence (though its aesthetic would have been impacted). Finally, there are mechanisms to mitigate a bad dice rolls, but a player that has multiple rounds of truly bad rolls will have an uphill battle staying competitive.

Edit, Sept 2017: I have incorporated the event cards of Ladies into Troyes. First off, the cards do not match. The backs of the red action cards are noticeably different. The differences in the other cards are less noticeable. That said, the action cards and purple dice add a lot of good stuff to the game. However, adding in all the new action cards highlight how AWFUL the iconography is on the cards. You'll want to print out the action/even card player aide listed in the files section of the Ladies expansion. The cost-to-production ratio is definitely off for the base game and especially for the Ladies expansion. The game, however, is still special, so I'm not reducing its rating despite the publisher's bad decisions.

I don't have any plan on using the ramparts module any time soon. It seems superfluous.

I was intrigued by the hype concerning the use of dice and possible ways to mitigate bad rolls, such as using influence or buying opposing dice, but it's still way too random for me.  The Events tend to randomly pick on one player more than others, such as the neutrals always bumping the Green dudes.

Scoort zeer hoog hier op bgg, maar ik ben toch geen grote fan.
Waarom niet?  Inhoud visueel niet mooi.  Te abstract, te weinig thema.

Dobbelstenen en ventjes toewijzen aan acties.
Tegelijk zijn er ambetante gebeurtenissen die alle spelers storen, maar die je kan gaan resolven.  Maar wie zal dat doen?

Even after 9-10 plays, there's one little rule I always miss.  I swear, next time, I'll play everything correctly.  And win!

I really like all the combos and manipulations and decisions that could be made.  True - this doesn't lend well when you've got new/AP (or worse...both) players in on the game with you, but for some reason I don't mind that when it comes to Troyes, as I like the game so much I'm willing to suffer through that stuff.

I have come to the conclusion that dice drafting/worker placement games are not my favorite.  But they do make a pleasant change and this is perhaps the best one I have played.  It looks a little ugly and the iconography could be a bit more easy to make sense of but this has everything I want from a dice drafting game - all rolls are good for different things, easy to change rolls and crucially you can cheaply use other peoples dice.  A little dry and point salady.  Bonus cards that only you know about are great but really worth very few points.  Great replayability in the base game alone a plus.  In some ways I like Marco Polo more and Discoveries is pretty, simpler and quicker but overall Troyes takes the crown.

Every play is a brand new puzzle. It plays like a different game with 2,3, & 4. It's just so good, so smart. Due to the dice, you can find yourself needing to change plans every turn. The game rewards the player that can best use his dice as an asset, regardless of the roll. On the 5th play, it occurred to me that this is the BEST game I have ever played!

2 Player: Excellent, money is tight, lots of actions.
3 Player: Perfect!
4 Player: Money is readily available, but actions are limited.

[i]Posted: 7/10/112, Rated: 7[/i]

The experience of learning a new game greatly influences the likelihood that you will want to return to it.  Returning to a game grants you additional perspective to judge it.  I learned [i]Troyes[/i] at BGG.con '11, and was taught by a long time Internet friend and fellow Werweolf player seanp.  I [i]wanted[/i] to like the game.

The theme and artwork are very pleasing: I think the game looks [i]good.[/i]  Dealing role cards to the different buildings enforces variation between games, and thus provides replayability: there is no scripted opening, here.  Being able to modify dice values, and to purchase dice from other players results in many player options.  Lastly, variable and hidden bonus conditions make it more difficult to evaluate those options.

The result is that [i]Troyes[/i] turns out to be very "thinky" for a game that uses dice as a resource.  It is difficult to plan ahead for your turn, as the dice you want to buy may not be available by the time you're ready to play.  The games moves more slowly than it should.  This feeling may be mitigated when playing with experienced players.

Dice manipulation games have seen a resurgence.  After having played many of them including [i][thing=43249]The BoardGameGeek Game[/thing][/i], [i][thing=55670]Macao[/thing][/i], and [i][thing=84876]The Castles of Burgundy[/thing][/i], I can say that [i]Troyes[/i] is the heaviest.  If you expect dice games to be light, then you will be unhappy.  If you expect medium weight games to eschew dice, then you will also be unhappy.  When played with the right group, it is an enjoyable time even if it does feel a little long for what it is, but then again that could be said of any game.  An average sentiment earns an average rating.

Como me gusta este juego de gestión de dados. Me parece un euro sencillo y al mismo tiempo complejo, ya que tienes que encontrar un combo que te ayude a prosperar mientras los demás jugadores intentan echarte de los edificios. Al final tienes que valerte por ti mismo e ir a los puntos directos, planificando la carta de los roles de jugadores

So much fun! Basically, your dice are workers that go to different parts of the board to do different things. Like, fighting off invaders, recruiting special workers, building city walls, etc. The game really shines for me in two ways. Firstly, you can use the other players dice. It is not overly mean but can really be effective. Second, everyone has a secret objective they are working for that give extra points at the end of the game. I really like that many things give points but each player has something specific to focus on to maximize those points. Just got the expansion and can't wait to try it out!

A worker placement, action selection game requiring you to effectively leverage yours and other players' dice rolls to your advantage given a variety of action and event cards that arise.

Plays well with 2p, but 3p may be its sweet spot.

After finally having the opportunity to play this game I must say it was not what I expected. I expected a deep and fluent game with a pretty steep learning curve. To my surprise it seemed very opaque and convoluted. Could be that this was all due to my inexperience. I was also surprised that the take that factor was so big. Lastly the design of the game just increased the sense of unclarity. I would want to play it again to see if some experience with the game can improve my feelings. But for now this has dropped like a rock to the bottom of my wishlist.

Like dice ? Like combinatorics ? This is a game for you.

Pros:
- unique concept
- the value of resources is not clear (depends on the game)
- replayability through dice, professions and event cards
- art is interesting
- dice manipulation
- the joy of making an awesome combos

Cons:
- rules need clarification in places, especially card explanations
- the box is too big for what you get inside (should be slimer) 
- expansion is way too expensive, luckily the base game is great on it self

Pro's:

1) The art, aesthetics and historical theme are particularly fantastic, for me the game does feel thematic even though the game elements will sometimes override the theme.
2) Randomization of the cards and events make each game slightly different.
3) Figuring out the best combinations of cards and how to maximize your dice usage feels very strategically deep.
4) Events forcing the players to battle some of the issues in common to prevent them from getting out of hand while also maintaining the competitive player element is one of my favourite aspects. 
5) There are many ways to mitigate dice rolls. One of the few games where it feels great to roll 1's since you can always mitigate them. The ability to purchase dice means you are nearly always able to do what you want to do with the game occasionally pushing you into a certain direction.

Con's:

1) I wish there were a few more cards of each type.
2) Some of the iconography is not entirely clear and the rulebook needs a few more clarifications.

This game is...interesting. 

I appreciate a lot about this game. Every game plays a bit differently. The puzzles it presents always change depending on variable cards and the other player's strategies. There's a lot of little mechanisms that interweave nicely with each other, and there doesn't seem to be a clear way for anyone to win in any particular game. It's also quite interactive with other players, which is something I need to have in any game I buy...

But for some reason I still come away from the game thinking "Meh, that was okay.", and Im not sure why. My best guess is that it requires a decent amount of thought, but I'm not really rewarded for the mental gymnastics as much as I think I should be? Also, there's no way I'd be able to teach this to most people - this is a gamer's game in complexity - and I think that issue in accessibility makes me a little bit sad.

Played once. Very enjoyable, but very little connection to the theme. Kind of hard to get into, and I felt that bad luck can really hit you in this game, but it is far too early to say that it is a major fault with the game. I guess that with experience these bad luck moments can be minimized. A gamers game, definitely, and I am very keen to get to try this again.

RATING: 6.5
OK, so I wasn't really in the mood and, whilst I like dice games, I hate the ones where rolling high is good and rolling low is bad.

So take the following with a pinch of salt.

Setup was fiddly and rules were very complex for what is quite a simple game. Seemed like there were about twice as many things to do and keep track of than the game really needed.

Some of the concepts are nice - only knowing a bit about what the final win bonuses will be, having to co-operate to destroy the black cards (because if you let them multiply you all suffer). However, the artwork and symbols are almost wilfully non-intuitive and having to remember the possible win bonuses is no joke.

Probably one that you would enjoy lots if you played it lots, but I am not sure I want to make the investment.

Lasting Impressions:
---------------------
I just love this game.  I love the art, I love the dice rolling, and I love the endless combinations of special powers that it presents.  I think the only thing that holds this back from being a perfect 10 is that it can be tough to get played.  It really is a Love it or hate it game, and I don't know a ton of people who love it.  The expansion is worth getting for the extra characters, but little else.  I like playing with the purple dice (which can't be stolen), however obviously you can use your own dice outside of the game and don't need to purchase the expansion for this.

Big let down for me. I try to research the games that I buy and this one was no exception. But I guess my research was flawed or insufficient because I just didn't enjoy this one.

RATING: 8
One play.

We messed up some rules, and I think that the rule book could suffer from a slight bit of misprinting/disorganization.  This is not destructive to the game but the game will benefit from multiple plays as one would stand a large chance of getting some rules wrong unless being taught by a seasoned player.

Other then this, the game plays smooth and fun.  There is a lot of material and action going on for any one round of the game, and those that pay attention to detail and plan well are sure to be rewarded by points for their game play.

I would like to get a few games under my belt to see if the game "opens" with subsequent games.  But I will definitly make sure that this happens.

A keeper, good medium weight game, easy enough for dedicated casual players, meaty enough to satisy a more then casual player.

A worker placement game with innovative use of 6-sided dice.  It's a rather mean game with lots of stealing and poaching good spots/cards from your opponents.

Only one play through. Other than finding the first time could drag for players with bad AP, I loved it! I need to play it again. I'm a sucker for dice rolling too apparently, and I love just how unique this game is compared to anything else I've played.

Seemed a bit random to me, maybe playing it with a headache and a headcold didn't help, but I just didn't get in to it. 

It's only 5 turns and in one of those turns early in the game, I had to waste all my dice on combating enemies, before I had much of a money or production engine going and with all my guys bounced out of the buildings. I never caught back up. 

Something didn;t grab me about this, it's a more random version of Caylus.

RATING: 8
This is a very good game.  The dice mechanic is very good.  If you roll best, you are still going to benefit from that, but buying dice is perfectly balanced in my mind (low cost for one, but much higher costs to steal multiples.) The card combos were obviously thought out and provide the meat of the game.  I dislike having rotating start player in this game... It really needs an initiative system.  Unfortunately, it is too long and meaty for lunch, too complicated for fun with Mark, and Steve already owns it, so I probably won't get this one.

Owes much to Puerto Rico and Caylus but does it better. Dice without the albatross of luck, somehow. Plus, plays brilliantly with two! Only shortcoming: lacks the elegance and integration of thematic elements - almost an abstract.

This game is just too cool. I've never felt so in control of dice. The various occupations powers are awfully fun, and I have nothing but good things to say about this one.

Well, for now. Since purchasing, it's only hit the table as a two player game. This looks like this one might be a little dense to teach.

Original text:

Rating of 7.5 based on initial play. 

Came away from this game marveling at the cleverness of the design! The "mathiness" of the Activity Cards was a little tough to initially understand, but once the visual language is understood it became a bit more natural.

I enjoyed the game very much (except for the fact that one of the four players didn't keep his head in the game and made conversation with others in the room when he should have been playing...). Can see how 3 players might be better than 4 - less downtime and quicker rounds.

Am looking forward to playing again and will revise my rating as I play more.

There are a lot of good things to say about Troyes. The traditional artwork enveloped by the muted tones of the overall board is quite appealing and original within the genre. The overall concept of the game leans slightly heavy, giving players a plethora of choices bounded within a dice-drafting, worker placement fist fight. 

However, as play progresses, the game takes a weird turn. Sometimes, there's not enough money; sometimes the variable card-setup just isn't that exciting. For me, the choices were not as captivating even though the theme was hilarious. "Oh look, a marauding brigand of monks engaged in theological conflict..." (The Table Erupts)... so I'll use these dice to put cubes on some of these events.... zzzz

So far, its kind of a snooze.

I suspect my ranking of this will climb after subsequent plays. A lot to learn in this game and I am not really sure what to think just yet. It was very fun and uses dice in a new and unique way. I can see this becoming very enjoyable when I have all of the cards memorized and don't have to spend so much time looking them up. AP was high with this, but that is not a bad thing in my book. Looking forward to playing again.

Yes, there is a new mechanic to use dice for actions.
Makes this alone a good game?
I guess for a lot of geeks ìt`s enough.
The graphic design is bad and the lack of theme turns me off.
The managment of the conversion of Influcene, money and  action dice into vp are indeed well designed, but the game is very confusing and fiddly. A lot of icons, meeples and cubes and coulured dice are creating a blur. Players who can unscramble the blur and find the best combos will have fun and be good on this one. But in the end it`s too much work for me. 
I think agricola/caylus fans will love this game. For everyone who dislikes or a have luke-warm feelings to these ones will also be turned off by Troyes. 
EDIT: 
What I like is the random elements of the game (Victory Points cards, Activitay cards and Event cards which gives the game variance.

I really like this game.  Dice power for workers with different objectives is fun.  It's as much tactical as strategic.  I love the art style and the theme is tight with the mechanics.  Understanding the card mechanics is essential. Amazing.  4p is less fun / too tight in my opinion.  Best with 3.

Really loved this game.    It was an impulse buy simply from the gushing of a number of reviewers I follow on youtube.  

The flow of the game is so very smooth, and once you get familiar with the iconography, it is one of the smoothest games I have played.    

Also the sheer variety in setup and direction is outstanding.   I love that you are not locked out of any areas too.   

I also love the intrigue behind guessing what scoring cards each player has.    

Amazing game.

RATING: 4
Heavier than it seems at first and there is definitely some depth here.  Lots of options and the game pulls you in many different directions.  A bit of a mish-mash of mechanics which works in that it feels balanced but just wasn't that fun.  It doesn't feel like the game has much of an arc or that you're ever making any progress at anything.  Too dry and convoluted.  Played about 4 or 5 times but it never clicked and flowed the way I felt like it should and just kind of fell flat.  Really unfortunate because I liked the art and really wanted to like the game.

After 4 plays, it's a 9.  I'm not sure if it'll stay there or not.  I'd say it's medium weight.  So far all of the plays have been 2 player and it's definitely deep for two players and a 30 - 40 minute game.  I'd rate heavier than Race but not as heavy as 'Gric.  The dice do provide some randomness but only when resolving event cards or the archer.

Take Alien Frontiers. Add plethora of Rube Goldberg contraptions which churn out some equivalent of VPs at the end. Remove all fun & randomness from the dice rolls. Throw in unreadable medieval text & barely discernible yellow & white colors on the board & cards. Voila! You get Troyes. 

A very troying dice game. Beware of Geeks bearing gifts. This Trojan Horse hides an army of modifiers who will massacre any semblance of chance in your dice game. Why bother with dice at all???

Es un juego de dados en el que los dados no son especialmente determinantes y sirve para muchas cosas. Cada jugador tiene un distrito y comienza con 4 meeples en el tablero. Su ubicación determina cuantos dados y de qué color va a tirar. Una vez que todos han tirado los dados, estos pueden utilizarse para activar cartas, que generan diversas ventajas, echar a otros meeples de  su sito (y conseguir más dados en turnos siguietnes), luchar contra los enemigos, etc, etc. Son demasiadas cosas. El juego es dificil de explicar, pero una vez que se entiende, es sencillo. Puedes comprar los dados a tus contrincantes y usarlos para tus propósitos (no se pueden negar a la venta). Durante el juego se van sumando puntos de victoria que permanecen ocultos y al final hay un recuento y se incrementan según los personajes que entren en juego. Hay tres categorías de cartas: clero, militar y civil. De cada una de ellas hay 9 pero sólo se usan 3 al azar en cada partida y cada una representa una actividad que genera ventajas, por lo que la rejugabilidad es bestial. Una auténtica joya. Le he cascado un 8.5 en mi primera partida, y tiene pinta de convertirse en otro caylus. Muy, muy recomendable, aunque dificil de jugar con no-jugones.

Añadido a mi colección en Mayo de 2011. En principio era un pedido conjunto con Marc, pero cuando fui a pagarselo no me cogió el dinero y me dijo que era un regalo. Esto le ha convertido en una de las piezas más valiosas de mi ludoteca.

It's a highly tactical point salad with a mildly innovative core mechanism. Game feels pretty scripted - get money early, convert X resource into big points in Ages 3/4/5, while building up to score your end game bonus card. Great, I can do the same thing 4-5 times in half the length with Race for the Galaxy.

I love interactivity in games, but this is the type of interaction I hate. There's no way to make long term plans. Your opponent does a move that screws up what you were about to do, and you do the same back to them. It's an aimless back and forth, rather than an interesting build up into a devastating move.

For a mid-weight Euro, try something like Concordia that's far more cohesive a design, has much more meaningful interaction, and gives players agency in what they want to do.

RATING: 6.5
Another solid BGG top 100 Euro. Interesting twist on worker placement in that your workers stay on the board and can be re-used round to round, but can be "pushed off" their square by someone else. The extra card locations seemed to be a bit of a grab bag, and once everyone latched on to the strategy of defeating enemy cards for points, that seemed to be the clear path to go, calling into doubt the value of some other tactics. I'm sure with multiple plays other more legitimate scoring paths present themselves, but on the first play effective strategic options seemed limited. 

Glad I played it, but unlike some other gems I've found on this quest, not in a huge hurry to replay.

A very creative dice Euro. Played first with two players. It was entertaining, but I was not convinced. Played most recently with four players and i thought it was a hoot.

Not a dice game. It's a euro action selection game. Very innovative use of the dice though.

Quite a clever & original game that is incomparable to anything else.

Such a different and impressive follow up to Carson City from Xavier Georges.



Update (Nov 2010) 7.5 -> 8.0 it's apparently very replayable. Our third game was tight on money and influence, which was the opposite of our first 2 games.

Update (Aug 2011) 8.0 -> 8.5 it's holding up very well after 10 plays.

Troyes was one of the games which seemed really good based on reading the rules before going to Essen. Fortunately it really is a solid game. It's themeless and heavy in mechanics but the dice mechanic works really well and brings interaction to the game play. The amount of choices and ways to score points seems to be huge and different from game to game which increases the replayability of the game greatly.

Strong title in moderate euro category; is worth the few sessions required to understand the game mechanics.  Typical of a euro, tactics are key to success, but because sessions typically turn on late, high-leverage moves, players can pursue distinct strategies.

As soon as someone recommends Alien Frontiers, Voyages of Marco Polo or Kingsburg you hear the whispers: "Troyes did it first and did it best."

Unfortunately it is OOP and expensive. Luckily I got a copy and had the chance to try it.

I understand why it is the ancestor of these games, although it plays very differently.
-events are a small semi-co-op-element where you have to decide how much you sacrifice for the group for just a small benifit.
-dice aren't taken for granted, you have to plan which dice you want to have next round or you have to pay for them

Currently it shares the #2 with Alien Frontiers right behind Marco Polo. Time will tell.

RATING: 7
Tentative 7 after first play.  A pretty enjoyable game.  It's nice to play a euro that feels innovative, and this certainly a nice twist from the standard "place workers, get crap, build crap".   It's certainly never trivial working out what the best move is.

The stealing of dice seems a little harsh to me, as it effectively steals potentially valuable actions away from players for little compensation.  

I'm a little hesitant of games where a player in the lead can get pounded into submission (losing the game directly because you played a strong early game just feels wrong to me), and in a 4 player game of Troyes, you could potentially have most of your dice stolen by the other 3 players before you ever got to do anything, which feels a little punitive.

I love this game. Dice allocation, area control, worker placement, cooperative elements, mild "take that" actions, man-oh-man there is a lot going on in this game. So much fun. 

I am amazed that the designers created a game that basically creates a totally different board every time you play. Each different combination of action cards allows you to set up a different money and VP engine every time you play. With the expansions, there are thousands of combinations, and you will never play the same game twice. How awesome is that?! Can't wait to play again.

Well balanced, and influence of dice luck on a player's success is actually pretty low. Instead, if rolled dice are bad, all players are weakened by lack of good choices. This is an interesting mechanic. An exception is the way workers are replaced by new workers, which I found to be quite annoying.

Interesting and somewhat complex game.  It is yet another Eurogame of generating resources that you then convert into other resources and victory points, but it has one saving grace: dice rolling!  I enjoy the random elements, but they can be hard to accept in a game that demands this much planning.  The ability to buy other people's dice is brilliant and adds a lot of tension in deciding how to play out your turn.  I like it, but can completely understand why others do not.

11/20/2012 - This is a very solidly designed game. I had it for a year before playing it, because I feared it was too dry and "euro" for me. While it is very euro, it has enough dice action and player interaction to give it some soul. It feels a bit like Alien Frontiers, since it uses dice as workers for worker placement. But there are MANY more strategic and tactical options in Troyes than in Alien Frontiers. That said, I don't like the Troyes theme as much, the graphical design is jarring and ugly, and the higher learning curve means I won't get it to the table as much as I do Alien Frontiers. Those positives and negatives mostly offest each other, so I'm rating Troyes an "8" for now -- the same as my rating for Alien Frontiers.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great medium-heavy-weight dice-drafting / dice worker placement strategy game with many paths to victory, which unveil as the game progress, so players must be strategic and tactical.
++ I like that the game have "Event" that are randomly took from a deck of card at each round that may, or may not, affect all players' short-term strategy and that everyone most work on, kind of semi-cooperatively.
++ The fact that you can buy opponents' dice and that you can also manipulate your dices (flip them or re-rolled them using "Influence" points) is a great way to mitigate the luck of the dice rolls and also adds up  a layer of strategy.
++ Simple but effective dummy-player mechanism.
++ Good replayability due to only 3 out of 9 "Activity" cards (for each color) used per game, especially if you can get the bonus cards.
++ There is one expansion available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).
++ The Ladies of Troyes expansion really add a lot of "more of the same": more Activity cards, more Event cards, more Character cards, etc. This bring in a lot of variability that is really welcome when we have played the game a lot. We really enjoyed this added variety and the new combo possible with all the new cards.

Clever bits but inexcusably overwrought, this sucker really needed to be hacked down in both complexity and playing time (although in truth it's another game where if you really developed it and focussed it down to just the stuff the game really needs, you might find out that there is no there there). Also, it's bizarre that in the 4-player version, the 4th player is at a non-trivial disadvantage for which the game gives no compensation.

Very cool dice rolling, manipulation, and placement game!  A fairly simple ruleset, but with lots of difficult decisions and choices to make since there are several different ways to use the dice.

I also love the event cards that occur turn by turn that punish the players, a la the events in Year of the Dragon.  I always love games that punish the players, so this is one of my favorite elements in a game.  It's also cool that these events will recur until the players finally defeat the event to remove it from the game.

Overall, a very cool strategy game with a little dose of luck added with the dice.  Good stuff!

Troyes gets the nod here because it seems to be the one recent purchase that I find myself most wanting to play. I'm just not sure how long it will continue to captivate me. I'm impressed with both the production and the design, but the game isn't one I'm likely to obsess over for months. The last play felt a little easy. Perhaps, like Hansa Teutonica, it will depend on the abilities of experienced players to up the ante of an otherwise straightforward game? 

Troyes is a resource management game, sure, but it's not a game that involves early investment in position/resources followed by a wholesale transition into VP production. Nearly every action you take provides small VP gains and very few provide large ones. I think of it as more of a game of tactical opportunism. I usually try to open the game defensively, establishing positions that keep me from being dependent on particular colors of dice. I also like to have a decent source of income. After that, I simply look for good scoring and screwage opportunties on a round-by-round basis and try to deduce which characters are in play so that I don't fall too far behind on any one axis. 

Mind you, I've only played two-player and the two-player game is only four rounds long, so the notion of a long-term strategy is a little silly -- you would be comitting to an approach before knowing what opportunities are available. Perhaps this is why the game also feels a bit light to me at present: I'm not constantly adding to a single, coherant VP engine; I'm simply positioning myself to have multiple opportunities for small-scale card synergies depending on the needs of the moment.

On this note, I suspect that the primary drawbacks to the game are exacerbated in the two-player game. The game still feels too tactical, even now that we are familiar with the card functions. This would likely be mitigated with each additional round of exposed Activity Cards (in the two-player game, a new card is revealed in 3 rounds out of 4). The dice-purchasing dynamics are also diluted in the two-player game (admittedly, this could be a groupthink issue). Each player, including the neutral player, has so many dice to begin the round that everyone has a little of everything and the need to purchase from your opponent is rarer than I expected it to be. 

Some games become noticeably better with the addition of a third player -- Brass, Agricola, and Neuland come immediately to mind. I can't tell whether that will be the case with Troyes (which is still good with just two), but I can tie enough of my complaints to features more prominent in the two-player game that I will hold off on officially rating it until I get it to the table with more. Will AP and downtime be a countervailing consideration with increased player counts?

A second complaint that has nothing to do with player count, and which will likely keep Troyes from the tippy-top of my ratings, is that the game feels very dry and procedural. There are too many little steps to do in a particular order, and none of them have an intuitive thematic guidepost that keeps me on track. I always just instinctively jump right to the dice-rolling and activity phases. It's something like this:

[q]
Me: *Roll* Awesome! I'll activate the Archer. 
Jenn: We need to do income first.
Me: Oh, yeah. Ok...um...2, 4, 6, 7...I get 3 money. Okay, I'll activate the Archer!
Jenn: We need to flip over event cards first.
Me: Oh, hehe. Yeah. So...red card, and this one says white. Okay. So that's 5 black dice, and we both lose 2 influence, and then remove a cube from the cathedral. Hmm...I guess I'll counter these two with this red die and take two influence. 
Jenn: I'll counter this one with this white. 
Me: Damn...umm...I guess I'll counter the last two with this other red die for two more influence. Okay, now I'll activate the Archer! 
Jenn: Actually, I'm first this turn. I'll buy your last red die for 2. 
Me: :soblue:[/q]

Still, if you're the sort of gamer who enjoyed Homesteaders, I recommend checking Troyes out. 

If I had a 7.5 rating, [thing=73439][/thing] would have a comfortable home.  I'm impressed with the design and the production, but I don't find it gripping.  It's a little fiddly, a little procedural, and a little AP-inducing.  Despite all that, it also doesn't quite feel quite complex enough.  I would put it closer to Hansa Teutonica than to Le Havre in terms of weight.  Would like to see how it goes with 3 players. 


1/24/11: This weekend we finally taught the game to a third player. What a difference! The 3-player game was head and shoulders above anything we had experienced with just two. It just seemed to come to life. While it still had some flow issues, it was certainly more dynamic and interesting. In particular, repelling the event cards and purchasing dice seemed much more lively when the results weren't zero sum. Additionally, having only three character cards in play made that whole guessing game a little more exiting. 

Ultimately, I don't think the game's going to drastically change in my esteem, but it certainly seems much more promising than it did only a week ago. Could it potentially reach the tail end of my 8s?

Very interesting roll dice and worker placement game. Bad rolls are evened out by the ability to purchase and use other players rolls. Interesting conflicts between the different possible types of work, and the "tech effects" of the different jobs/actions available. 

Also, a good amount of randomization in the setup helps keep games fresh.

Great dice placement game where players activate various board actions through their dice or opponents' dice. Very nice twist on the usual dice placement which makes prioritizing dice very important before other players nab your good dice as their own. I really did enjoy how the board grows for the first 3 rounds by adding an extra action to each on the 3 main buildings. I also enjoy that there are a few different possible cards for each action spot which makes each game very different. I wish the artwork was a bit more colorful and I think choosing pink to represent "any color" is a bit too close to red. But these are just a few nitpicks for a really enjoyable game for dice and worker placement enthusiasts.

Excellent Euro which blends many mechanics to make this meaty whole.  Tons of tactical choices each turn and not a very random game despite the heavy reliance on dice.  On the downside, the game does seem prone to causing analysis paralysis.

This game is one of Rahdo's top 10 of all time. Shut Up & Sit Down also highly recommend this game. 

Patricia doesn't like dice, and the game is too heavy for the group. So... a must-buy? :)

It has been out-of-print since forever, but I got one of the reprints.

After a disastrous first play (four-player game), I wasn't sure if this game was worth all the hype. The rules were hard for some players to understand. Some people thought that buying the dice was "too mean." It turned into a three-hour slog.

We played a two-player game after that. The game was quick - only 90 minutes. It went fast, there was still competition, and we were better at guessing one another's character cards. It ended up in tie 45 points each. (I realized after the game that I could have scored *one more point* and won the game.)

I think the game will work, once everyone is used to the game. There is a slight learning curve, though.

I like trying to see which combos come out that best suit my plans for my lord(s). I like planning out how to use dice based off of my opponents' capacities.

I really dislike trying to figure out which lord(s) my opponents have. Like, enormously. I don't want to do it. Nor do I want to try and trick them into thinking I have a different lord than I do. For me, it interferes with what I want to be doing in a game like this.

And, let's face it, in the land of modern euros, games that do the things I like about this game are a dime a dozen.

Personally, I don't like the artwork and it is extremely difficult to read the text on the cards! However, it is quite important to be able to read the names of the cards, as every single card has "unique iconography" (which is not really intuitive) that you have to reference in the rules. Still, the game is very nice, the dice placement is awesome, but somehow we rarely played this game at all. Not exactly sure why, but we sold it after only 3 plays.

Played second times with four players. Troyes is the game that I had played back in the previous years when I first into boardgame. Just have a chance to play it again and I have to stated that I really fell in love with this game. When you grasp the flow of the game, everything seems to be so smooth, love how you can manipulate the dice in many ways and semi-cooperative that players need to deal with the invaders from the event cards. 

Moreover, the interaction between players, combo of the cards. Only three cards will be played in three primary domains of the city(Religious/Military/Civil).           Which gives a freshness new way of the combination to the game every time you play. 

All in all, I’m looking foward to explore on the game in many more plays since Troyes itself has a tons of replay ability(Which I would love to own the Ladies expansion.).
It maybe too soon to concluded the rating of the game since I got to play Troyes twice, but for me this is an absolutely by far number one game for me.

Troyes is a great dice game, probably only second to Castles of Burgundy! The reason why these games succeed in my book is that the luck of the dice is greatly reduced! In CoB even more so perhaps, as higher numbers are probably better in Troyes, but there are lots of options to change and manipulate your dice rolls which is awesome. Lower numbers might actually be quite good too, especially in the end, as the other players won’t buy your dice, while you can still buy their high dice all while also changing your own low dice to higher numbered dice if you’ve got the influence. This influence mechanic was integrated very well and I liked how you need to balance money, influence and victory points!

There are a lot of very good mechanics; how you fight against the black cards, how you push other players’ meeples out of the buildings and thereby getting extra dice yourself, how you buy dice from your opponents, how you pass and can get extra money etc. One thing I liked a lot was the secret objectives, but I don’t think they are going to have a big impact on the pointscoring; I would guess everybody always gets at least 3 points and probably the full 6 (if I remember correctly). The variety because of the fact that only 9 cards are used in each game means that the game has great replayability.

Troyes was much simpler than I had thought and heard everybody say. The rules really aren’t that difficult. Personally I thought the artwork is ugly, but I don’t really care. I am looking forward to the next time Troyes is getting on the table!

Yet another game that involves building a cathedral in medieval times (and fighting off bandits and immigrants) but the theme is pretty lacking here. This game is quite abstract and has all the usual euro-mechanics seen in so many games of converting money (and in this case dice) to gain influence and VPs. Overall, rather dry and uninspiring.

Another dice game. In this one, dice values count very much, so the luck factor is somewhat higher. Yes, you can buy opponents dice, but that costs money, and you get more money if you roll well - again. And the action cards are not great; vastly different in usefullness, so usually only a few get used, but by all players.

I was very excited to play this because I have wanted to play it for some time now.  There's lots of crunching numbers in this game, and I like all the math aspects of it, so be ready for some calculating. The events and cards make the game different every time you play. Buying dice from others adds some nice competitive interaction with players. After more plays I may like Troyes more, there's lots to know, initially, after more plays it might get more interest.

Another one of those dice games whereby the die results are not your typical uses (think Monopoly or Risk), but instead used as resources (think Kingsburg) for building up your powers (in this case, the cards you play).

This game is incredibly good and knocks off Yspahan as my favorite way to handle dice in games.  The fact that you can use other peoples dice to perform a combo of powerful actions is awesome, even if you have to pay to do it.  The way the character cards are revealed and how they help you, the way you get dice to roll, the way the barbarians attack the city and how they are defended, and the way you spend dice all interplay very nicely and create brain churning decisions that don't rely on blind luck, but a planned out strategy.  Must own this game and one of my favorites in a long while.

Rated 6 after one play, but this could go all over the place depending on reactions to future plays.

For a first game of Troyes, I spent half the game trying to simply hold it together and learn the flow of a turn. With workers, and dice, and dice allocation, and money, and influence... it's a lot to hold together. I couldn't even really bother to try a strategy; I was just trying to survive and accomplish basic "point mongering."

On the one hand, there are some clever mechanics, and it's an incredibly big "playground" for trying different moves. On the other hand, there's almost no theme. I had no idea what cards represented, but it didn't really seem to matter. I started catching a spark at the end of the game, though, so I need to play this again to see if I discover more to enjoy.

Update: 2nd play, and I like it a little more. The game required more than one play for me to assess. It has very clever mechanics, and the use of dice is a strong feature. Still, I see almost no theme, so I feel like I'm just point grabbing. Also, there's a shocking diverse of options on any given turn. I normally like games that provide decision angst, and not "decision flooding." It's a solid game, I'll play it, but I won't go clamoring for it.

RATING: 7
Such a hard game for me to rate, I enjoyed it while playing even though I was struggling to start and figure out what activity cards were best. By the end of the game I was doubled up in score even though I thought I was doing fairly well. I think it came down to the other player getting higher rolls, a killer combo, and no competition to remove his dice on that color. Essentially I should have been interacting more instead of focusing on my weaker engine and to me that better engine was built primarily on luck from the dice, cards, and initial placement.

I typically love dice drafting and love Grand Austria Hotel, but I think the theme in there pulls me in so much more than this. I would definitely play this again and could see my rating go either way with a second play, but with it being a little heavier and a few more fiddly rules I think I'd always reach for GAH first.

:sugar: :( :) :D :) Finally, a designer with the courage to really stretch the boundaries of Euro-game subject matter: building a medieval city in France! Taking on the role of a prominent family in the city and competing with others to win glory through great monuments! Converting in-game commodities to VPs by patronizing the local barleywright or duckmonger! Building a cathedral, as you do! Brown-nosing some distant unpleasable monarch! This is some hot buttered innovation right here, faithful readers.

So yeah.

And many mechanical aspects, in turn, will also put one in mind of Extruded Euro Product #24 if you're used to it. Interaction is mostly light and indirect via blocking snatching and denying. Theme is both unoriginal and insubstantial. Gameplay is puzzly, with much pondering how you can most efficiently use the resources you have at hand in a given turn. Long-term strategy is difficult to plot out as available actions shift from turn to turn based on the fall of the dice -- while strategy is very much not non-existent, short-term tactics are a big part of the game.

You have, in significant ways, seen this film before, and if you're not a crazed devotee who desperately needs to own every Euro depicting city-building and resource-trading from late antiquity to early-modern Europe, you might be forgiven for giving this a miss. (And if you are, may God have mercy on your bank account, for CoolStuffInc will not.)

In many ways, then, this is a game tailor-made for indifference or dislike on my part. [i]And yet[/i], at first blush at least, I find myself thinking, well, damn: Stone Age and Kingsburg had a baby and it's a much better'n mom [i]or[/i] dad.

The game presents an array of options that a) change from game to game (part of what inhibits early long-term planning is not knowing what's on deck in terms of buildings once Turn 3 rolls around) b) force a substantial but not brain-fryingly difficult decision on every play and c) are not so samey as to descend into pure VP salad where everything you do yields goodies.

Hidden victory goals are a nice example of information asymmetry done right: you know one of the scoring criteria and over the course of the game can intuit the others, in part because the designers made the laudible decision to constrain the list of possible VP conditions to a manageable list of six, and in part because someone else will usually provide a useful "tell" by the priorities they show by their actions.

Likewise the number of possible action spaces per round per dice color is large enough as to encourage strategic flexibility without being so large as to leave victory in the hands of fate and/or the whims of the deck.

In short, I think that expanding these sorta-random aspects of the game (which would have been easy to do at a small marginal increase in cost), while it would have superficially increased the "replayability" of Troyes, would actually possibly result in a worse play experience.

Of course, this is just a guess, based on one (1) play so far. Further trials will tell the tale.

One aspect of the game -- the key aspect in some ways -- that seems like it introduces a bit element of chance (the dice, natch) actually ends up being a lot more controllable than you'd think at first. This game doles out prestige like fast-food joints give out ketchup packets, and intelligent use of your stock of prestige is what makes the dice work for you.

Finally, I must offer up a bit of praise for one superficial aspect of the game: I love the faux-medieval art and the presentation of the game in general. I like the use of good old meeples, and the chunky, tactile experience of the wooden bits and the dice. It wouldn't make a huge difference if the artwork more closely resembled the idealized/sanitized look of, say, Village, but something about the particular look/feel/color palette of this game draws me in.

A very pleasant experience, and a worthy choice for a medium-weight Euro with substance for a weeknight Meetup.

A very mathy game.  Another good use of dice in a game. Takes a twist on Stone Age that instead of choosing where to go, then rolling, you roll first and go to the most efficient use of the pips.  Also nice that there are a set amount of dice no matter the number of players and you can "borrow" as needed.

Looks to be a solid design with enough variability through the available Activities and events to keep this interesting.  

Only complaint so far is the board layout.  I am fine with the art direction and think their choices were good.  However, they could have done more to make the "boxes" on the board more integrated with the artwork. Many games like this have blended form and function much better than here. Also, some of the iconography seems a little inconsistent.  Nothing game breaking but slightly distracting.

Troyes is an amazing medieval themed board game about the city with the same name. Players embody heads of noble families who can struggle for important roles and positions within the city's economical and theological domains.
What I like about the game is how fast and complex it is. It's pretty easy to teach and can be enjoyed by many players with different taste. The theme is amazing and the artwork is great. The replayability is guaranteed by the action cards you prepare during setup.

Lo tuve y lo vendí pero este juego tiene algo que me gusta y me he vuelto a hacer con él. La mayor pega del juego es la iconografía de las cartas y las posibles dudas que surgen a consecuencia de la interacción entre las cartas.  Sin embargo, el juego es un gran juego de colocación de trabajadores.

Like it a lot, great game, it is mathy, tactical, almost no luck, and little long term strategies. Truly a gamer's game. Not for everyone and takes a couple plays to get it. Not an accessible game for sure.

Utterly intrincated game. My only complaint is that with some card combinations my group of players behaves very conservative and the game flows too slowly as the raw amount of dice/workers reduces.

Dice allocation game with hidden roles. Reasonable player interaction, without being directly adversarial. The luck of the dice is balanced by the ability to buy other dice from the other players. So unless you are first player and do an awesome roll (and therefore someone can't buy key dice before you use them) the luck element is significantly reduced. The money then acts as a further rebalancing/catchup mechanism throughout the game (i.e. if you lose your dice to other players they have to pay you for it). 

Each game will be different due to the different combination of activity and event cards, which means the game has good replayability, and leads to different strategies each game. 

In my first game I found it difficult to keep an accurate idea of the relative scoring positions of the players, and I thought I was dead last. I had however underestimated the VPs I had been accumulating in game relative to the others and ended up being equal first in a close scoring game.

This is a well designed game, but the rule book is absolutely terrible, almost to the point of making the game unplayable during the initial play.  A lot of rules assumptions were made and we completed play.  Many rules and card symbols were still unknown afterward and searching through rules clarifications online finally brought closure.  While I first wrote this off as euro trash, I have come to appreciate what the designers intended.

Though I'm not a fanboy, I can't help but think that this game would've been better designed by Stefan Feld.

Update: we played incorrectly, but I think our wrong rules are better. The "main" rules say that you may only put a worker onto a "free" space. That's the way we played. ANd it worked great. Then in the Notes it says if there are no free spaces, you can play a worker there anyway, and just not get the vp. Boo. Takes away the differentiation between players that develops during the game. Too much flexixibility also makes the game AP prone, as the number of options explodes after the 3rd round. 8.0 -> 7.5

Very nice dice game. The most substantial dice game I've played. Plenty of mitigations for bad dice rolls. The game setup can make for a very different game every time. Good variety of ways to get vp.

RATING: 4
(Played at Spiel 2010.) This game caught my attention (and that of many others) because of the claim of an innovative dice mechanism. Indeed, it is innovative: one allocates a number of dice in different colours to players, with the colours dependent on where the players have put some of their meeples, and then groups them together in the centre of the board. However it remains clear which player threw what dice. Then beginning with the starting player groups of dice are chosen to various things with them. A player can select his own dice for free, and has to pay handsomely for the use of dice of other players. The actions he can perform are, for example, installing new meeples to obtain more dice in the future, activating cards a certain amount of times depending on the total value of the dice group he assembled and the card he chose, or contributing to the construction of the cathedral. This goes on for several rounds, and at some point someone wins.

So what happens with low-valued dice? You can always use these to move in new meeples for more dice in the future, but since you tend to economise there ought to be a bias towards a greater churn at the lower end. A 6 is simply more useful elsewhere than a 1. You can also spend a little influence to flip over the die before using it, or spend some more to reroll. In this way there is no true ‘bad’ roll unless all of your throws are categorically low. The effect is that most of the time everything is useful and thus that the capriciousness of the dice is tamed.

On paper this looks pretty cool. In reality, I found the entire affair overwrought. What the cheerful stories [i]aren't[/i] telling you is that this game utilises three kinds of resources which more or less run together: money, influence, and VP. These three resources embark on a difficult conversion dance: for one action you pay money and gain influence; another costs you influence to gain VP; to use other players' dice you pay cash, but to turn over your own dice you use influence... It becomes a very mathy game where literally every single move you make carries a different cost, expressed in different units, making it hard to compare them. The fact that you want VP in the end makes it hard to seriously invest in these side denominations too. Undoubtedly one becomes more fluent with the manipulation as experience settles in; but for casual play Troyes is better not placed on the table, in my opinion. In fact, it is this calculating business which leads me to wonder why it is such a smash hit with boardgame fans. It is a surprisingly heavy game for something involving dice, and in my opinion one long abstract litany of addition, multiplication and division, with (very) weak 'thematics', without a clear growth mechanism, and without oodles of specialty cards—things which usually signal that the ‘average gamer’ is about to become a drooling and jonesing addict. Perhaps once every while there is room for a Troyes-like game too.

In summary: good and clever use of dice, without doubt, and thus a member of the Dice Done Right™ Club, but embedded in a game which to me feels like sticky syrup. Give me Yspahan anytime with or without the new cards: moves along at a much better pace, and preserves the simplicity and quickness of throwing dice throughout the game.

[b]Update[/b] Upon replaying the game I still consider it to be an example of cute mechanism first, and creative game play second. Games with dice selection mechanisms in them should strive to move more quickly than Troyes. My appreciation for the title has increased a little, but kitchen sink symptoms withhold me from pushing up the rate to a 5.

I love dice games that are done well. A good dice game puts in place restrictions and forces you to consider what you can achieve with what is available. Troyes takes this to the next level, because it gets you to think about what you can achieve with your opponents dice. This game gives you so much control over the dice that there is almost no luck. It took me a while to get around to playing the Ladies of Troyes, and that expansion just completes the game. Not terribly bothered by the ramparts, but the additional roles and goals add that little bit of extra variety that really rounds out the game. The purple die increases the control a little as well, which is a welcome addition.

Played only online but I find this game incredibly intriguing.  I enjoy it a lot and frequently have the urge to play, but am astonished at how quickly the game ends.  It feels like you have to plan almost entirely around surviving the current turn and then once you have done that a few times the game is suddenly over and you think "Wait!  I never got to implement any of my long term strategy!"

So far I have lost every game and still want to come back for more.  That is the mark of a GREAT game.

Friends I played this with did not like it. I may have a hard time getting this to the table and frankly that does not worry me too much.

Cleveland Secret Santa gift 2011.

After 2 plays, it feels a little soulless. I can normally live without a strong theme, but this one takes it a little to far. The cards just show mechanics without ANY connection to the theme. The dice mechanics don't do anything for me.

Again, not a bad game, I just don't know whether it is a keeper. I'd rather play Caylus.

RATING: N/A
Gameplay in spades. Chock full of two player reactive and even some proactive gameplay.

Too bad the board wasn't nice to look at.

Too bad the lots and lots of gameplay felt like Brass or the slower parts of Snowdonia.

I felt the weight in that the decisions were very hard and there was plenty of room to mess up. 

There was a whole lot of emphasis on economic style gameplay for this to be the dicey euro that Rahdo said it was. Well, that is what it seemed like to me.

I do respect this game, but this is not our thing. I do respect this designer and realize he makes good games that I and particularly we do not necessarily like. Out of Deus, Tournay, and Troyes; only Tournay was mildly my thing and it was not my wife's. We will not buy any further games by this designer. 

If I want to play a heavier game I would definitely choose another game my wife does not enjoy: Lewis and Clark over this. It is more my thing. And of course we would play her favorites. Snowdonia would be my wife's pick for the heavier game full of decisions she would rather play.

I was never into the Jones Theory anyway. Those are exactly the range of decisions that my kind of Jones Theory would cover. The heavier game that plays kind of slow. This is not the one we kept and wanted.

RATING: 8
Troyes is a game about worker placement and dice management. The game relies heavily on controlled luck, which I really love. Even though there are a lot of dice rolled, the better player usually won. This is because so many things can affect the dice, and the scoring method is partially hidden. It has everything I love except one...

The theme is just a dry medieval world. But it's a good game!

Components: All around good components, and mostly clear iconography. I even like the unusual periodesque art style.

Experience: Lots of options, especially because of the ability to buy dice from others. The price of buying dice is particularly ingenious, as it pressures players to take many small actions, rather than a few large actions. I enjoy the powers from teh building cards; the events; and deciding how to use my dice. Lots of different areas to focus on. In general a very forgiving game. Not sure the hidden victory conditions make sense; that bit of deduction doesn't add much, and the amount of hidden information will vary greatly based on the number of players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Absolutely great game. Playing Troyes for the first time I sat there simply amazed and perfectly still, just taking it all in. Extremely good example of fun, yet deep, gaming goodness. 

Gushing aside ... Troyes is an immensely repayable, solid game with multiple ways to win, filled with subtle player interactions, depth, flow, balance, tense decisions and a perfect level of opportunities to mess with other players (for me, that's low to moderate). This is simply a brilliant game on so many levels. One of the better Euro-type games I own without question. Very worthy of a strong "8" rating, just shy of a "9".

Not as difficult to explain as one might think or have heard. After the first game it really clicks with most gamers.

My first purchase of 2013. After nine plays? Even better. My rating went up to a 9, and has stayed there after kore than 20 plays. I still can't find a win, but hell, this is a great game. I am obsessed with this game. I love to teach the game at conventions.

[b]I own the following expansion(s) for the game:[/b]

Troyes Bonus Cards expansion
The Ladies of Troyes.

A rare expansion that actually adds a total of five mechanics that are exciting and easily usable to one of my favourite Euro games. Highly recommended expansion. I play with the new action cards, new event cards, purple dice, and the new women in my games of Troyes. Will hold off on the wall track rules until I have a better understanding of the subtle strategies of the base game (I have yet to win, which makes how much I love this game all the more remarkable).

I had always had this as a 9, but now upgraded to 10 partly because it's my daughter's favorite game and I love to play it with her, and partly because, it's one of my favorites, too.

I love rolling dice. This is the first game with dice that does not give me any kind of excitement doing so.
The ability to simply purchase any dice from the other players, means you can't be sure what dice you will have available once it becomes your turn. So a good roll might not even become beneficial to you, if you are late in the player turn sequence.
Also the hidden endgame victory points add a random element to the game that feels out of place.

RATING: 9
A very good euro game. Yes, euro with lots of dice. However, rolling ones doesn't mean you're screwed, as it is possible to manipulate dice a lot. Therefore randomness is reduced to a level where it has little impact on the game. 

The main mechanic of the game - taking from 1 to 3 dice and then dividing the result by a certain amount - works really well and opens a path for maaaaany possibilites, although is not very intuitive and sounds weird at first. Same goes to buying dice from others(!) - the fact that the cost of a single dice depends on the total amount of dice you want to use... yep, sounds odd and may be hard to explain, but once you get to it, it is pretty simple. Overall this game is a bit harsh when it comes to explaining the rules. I recommend to send your friends a gameplay video so then it's a lot easier to describe all the minor rules.

For me, there are three aspects that make this game shine: negative interaction, a unique approach to dice and combos. Despite the fact that Troyes is an euro, there are possibilities to mess with other players - you can buy their dice! Yep, you can roll sixes and then watch how it's just being taken from you. Pretty standard in this game. Once you understand the fact that dice you roll is in fact not entirely yours it's easy to accept and not irritiating. I like that mechanic very much. Secondly, you can push enemy meeples away from the buildings, therefore reducing the amount of dice they'll roll in the next turn. That's A LOT interaction for a euro, believe me. Another thing is all that connections and possible combos between activity cards. There are so many ways of gaining money, victory points etc. All you need is to see the combinations... and lots of dice of course. 

Drawbacks? Well, the game is dry. That's it. I have nothing against its graphic design, in fact I like it quite a bit(however I understand those who find it pretty ugly), it matches the theme and is excellent in its own, medieval right. But during the game you don't actually care. It's a point salad. An abstract euro game. Marauders attacking the city are represented by black dice. You have to defeat them... guess what, using your dice, representing civil, military or religious forces. For that purpose red dice is twice as strong, because it represents an army fighting against them. You simply have to imagine all of that. That's not the minus of the game, as it's euro. It's pretty standard. Just don't expect it to be extremaly thematic.

A solid 8 from me. I think even 8,5. Only 2-player games so far and, well, if it's true that it works best for 3 players then I'm looking forward to play that variant.

EDIT: Bumping to 9. I love how quick the game is despite the fact that it offers so many possibilities. It never outstays its welcome. 

It is excellent online as well. I've been playing it a lot on boardgamearena recently.

This is one of my favourite games. I love the combos, the randomness and low luck. You have to stay competitive during the game and change the strategy depending on dice, to permanently rethink your moves. I can't explain why but is very addictive.

Troyes was an interesting game that did some things I liked.  I didn't get enough out of the rules to do well on the first play, but I am sure it would improve with more plays.

This is one of those games where I'm sick and tired of not being able to do everything I want due to the game ending. Grrr... There are some sweet combos that one can pull off, but a lot of them are pointless because it takes too much time to set them up, and if you do put all your ducks in a row, the game ends before you can do anything. 

I enjoy playing this game, but how it ends frustrates me beyond belief.

+Ladies of Troyes, Promo cards

Initial rating based on only playing it once, I can already tell I prefer this much more to the likes of Alien Frontiers or Kingsburg. It's worth the effort to learn despite feeling overwhelmed when it's first explained...it'll click once you've played a round or two.

Update: Increasing to a 9. I just appreciate it more and more with each play. I seriously doubt I'll ever win a game of Troyes as is typically the case with me in games where you pick your poison because you can't do enough actions. I always seem the make the wrong choices but I don't care, it's a great design and fun to try to wrap your brain around it.

* Finally won a game!

LOVE this game! I wish the theme wasn't so stereotypically Euro (constructing medieval French city blah blah blah), but the gorgeous artwork makes up for it.

Depending on which activity cards come out, this game changes every time. Some games will be money rich, some influence rich, and some card combos will be so powerful that the winner will be the one who seizes them early and uses them often. Love the bonus cards, but I already want more! Expand this game, please!

The 4-player cap is a hit against the game, especially since it truly shines with 3, but that's it.

RATING: 7.5
Very good dice allocation game with a bunch of other stuff mixed in. Hidden end-game scoring, similar to the Impact Events in Through the Ages. Also includes a bit of cooperation in battling off militants as a team. 

It doesn't feel like a dice game, as there is virtually no such thing as a "bad" roll. There are so many options to do with the dice: spend influence for rerolls, buy dice away from opponents, low and high pips both useful for various actions.

Strategy tip: Although they count double against enemies, the red dice are not always the best to use to fight off enemies. The game sort of pushes you towards using the red dice for this, but I think this is sometimes a mistake, as there are often much better uses for these red dice.

Lots of difficult decisions to be made here.

Oh, one more thing. Please stop calling this a worker placement game. This is in no way a worker placement game. If anything, it's anti-worker placement, as you *remove* dice from the board to conduct actions. Not that it really matters though. :)

When we were selling our house, my game collection went into storage.  Of course I kept a few games in the house so that I could still play.  Unfortunately, Troyes wasn't one of them.  An opportunity presented itself for a day of gaming.  I went to the storage unit and dug through a bunch of boxes to find Troyes because I wanted to play it that badly.

Colocació de treballadors i majories, amb vàries vies per aconseguir la victòria.

Pros:
- Una de las cosas que más me gusta de Troyes es que existen múltiples formas de puntuar y, por tanto, multitud de estrategias diferentes para ganar una partida. Además, como en tantos otros grandes juegos, no es posible ir a una sola estrategia o puntuación, pues si desequilibras demasiado el tema de los puntos acabarás pagando por ello.

Contres:
- Lleig lleig
- Como dije en la reseña, yo creo que es un juego que hay que jugar con actitud competitiva y de puteo. Si cadascú va a la seva, perd interacció i gràcia.
- Por lo demás me parece un juego elegante, que se monta y desmonta rápido, con muchas decisiones por acción, si los jugadores no tienden al analisis-paralisis y saben jugar puede ser muy rapido, pero me deja un poco frio, no consigo implicarme al 100%, el final es un poco soso, no ha habido una progresión en la que empiezas con poco y terminas con un tinglado bien montado, muy plano. Un muy buen juego pero no del olimpo.
- Es comenta un problema amb els torns per jugadors. No tots els jugadors juguen els mateixos torns.
- Cuando llevéis partidas te darás cuenta que es siempre lo mismo, salen determinadas combinación de cartas, voy a hacer mi combo y lo demás me da lo mismo y otra vez y otra vez y otra y otra vez y otra vez y otra vez...
A parte es un juego pensado para 3 jugadores sí o sí, en una partida a 4 jugadores el cuarto jugador tiene una desventaja brutal que no se compensa de ninguna manera y a dos jugadores pues que quieres que te diga

RATING: 7
I've played Troyes quite a bit and always had a good time. The random setup and character cards makes for an absorbing and varied playing experience. 

However, I'm a big fan of dice-allocation games (having played a lot and designed a couple) and I think it's fair to say that this isn't one: The dice that each player rolls become a random selection of available resources that are available for any player to buy. Making it more of a resource management game. This makes for a very interesting mechanic but not one comparable to (for example) Alien Frontiers or Kingsburg.

It's not inherently dowm-timey but the fact that each turn is dependent upon the available dice (which is dependent on previous players' actions) means that it's not a good game to play with the AP prone.

Also, while it's not to everyone's taste, I love the artwork and theme.

Clever use of dice, but not always intuitive at first. Some dice give you future options in the form of cubes. Other dice have effects that depend on somewhat strange relationships to dice still on the board.

All of this is very good though, because when you really grasp all the options, you're able to find good moves even if your dice rolls aren't so great.

(However, there will be games where someone hits a hot streak with their dice. My recommendation: beat them anyway! It stings more.)

Game mechanics are brillant. Simple and easy to learn and teach, but rich and complex to master. Have to adapt and rethink your strategy all throughout the game because of many interactions with other players and many ways to win.

RATING: 7
Solid dice + action selection game. The interaction between the cards, dice, influence, money and scoring is quite elegant. There are lots of tough and interesting decisions to make. Compare that to most other eurogames, where the decisions are either horribly obvious and/or the interaction just isn't as well integrated.

The ability to influence or purchase dice effectively mitigates most bad die rolling. It's definitely much more about strategic placement than just rolling high. And there are times when you want the lower values anyway.

After a few plays, though, I do wonder if being the first player provides too significant an advantage, since that player (and the second player) will have two opportunities to go first, while players 3 and 4 do not. Also, I'm convinced that an economic strategy will almost certainly defeat someone who goes after the black cards.

RATING: 8
This odd game gets my vote for Most Creative Use of Dice, bumping Yspahan from the top spot. By expending the correct resources, you may alter your dice and buy an opponent's dice to enable you to take the most favorable available actions. It's like putting together card combos, but much more fun.

Speaking of cards, there's no shortage of those in this game. They provide victory points, resources, improved dice rolls, and, significantly, replayability. Troyes is an exception to my usual distaste for games that produce variety largely from whatever cards happen to be drawn and re-learned each game.

Potentially good, potentially bad.  Got into with no one knowing how to play exactly (ugh) and the rules apparently were a mess.  Once in, the game presents interesting decisions and afterwards I have continued to think about it.  My concerns are the randomness of the die rolls but also the arbitrary-ness of the die rolls.  Turn order is important as everyone picks over everyone else's dice.  Just don't roll low else you're stuck.  Add in variable powers and multiple economies and things feel overwrought.  I also didn't like how hard it was to get back into the buildings (where your dice come from) especially since the game is short (6 rolls) and you don't reap the benefit until the following turn.  Finally, the variable and hidden(!) endgame scoring conditions are just stupid.  All 6 bonus cards should be used each game and kept face up so people know what to work for.  A little clunky.  A lotta slow.  Should try again tho.

It's OK, but for me there are too many "if this, then that" rules to constantly be checking and it's not the most intuitive of all games.

I do like the dice-rolling aspect, paired with you can buy anyone's dice from them. Good for interaction and similar to using other people's buildings in games like Le Havre.

Whoever (among reasonably competent players) rolls the highest numbers is going to win. 

Yeah, I know it's rated 7.8 and has mechanisms built in for luck mitigation so that can't be true, but it really is  true.  

Dice are manipulated by spending a secondary currency, 'renown', which is gained by - you guessed it - rolling high numbers. 

Fans will say that it 'balances out' because you roll 'a lot' of dice. You probably roll on average around 20 dice per game. It's very likely that on that few dice some players will roll well above or below the mean.

Troyes has more bells and whistles than Stone Age, but at its heart it has the same central mechanism: [i]roll high and win.[/i]

Starting this out at an 8 after 1 play.   It's a fun game where you select dice (number and color) and then perform a various action based on the dice selected.  The dice mechanic is the part that makes it unique.  Looking past the dice mechanic, it is the common mechanic of "Take this, convert to this"..."Now take that, convert to this"  Basically converting dice to money, influence, more dice, and ultimately victory points.  There are cards which keep the conversions possibilities unique for each game.  So it seems pretty typical....but yet it's well done. I look forward to another play.

Thinking about bumping this down a point.  I'm not sure it has good replayability.  There are some obvious combos...some of which may be required to have a chance to win.  Also, I didn't like it as much with 4 players.  Seems like a better 3 player game as there is more room on the building cards...and you're less likely to get locked out of them.

Very interesting euro game. There are no games quite like it out there. At first look it doesn't seem like it has much of a theme. But after you look at the cards coming up they often make sense and slowly the theme becomes stronger and stronger. I quite enjoyed this game. I also think this rolling dice and using actions with them is starting to become my favorite mechanism. The artwork is beautiful.

RATING: 6
Players are family members, guiding the medieval city of Troyes through the construction of a cathedral, while dealing with various misfortunes afflicting the city.  Interesting game, where dice take a central role.  Players place pawns into three major buildings in Troyes, and pawns give their owners the ability to roll dice in that buildings colour.  The die results are plonked on the market and available for use by the owner, or for purchase by the other players.  Dice totals are used to combat the woes befalling Troyes, construct the cathedral, use various artists and tradesmen in Troyes, and so on.  The purpose is to keep an engine running, making sure the money, influence and victory points are ticking over nicely.  Lots of nice stuff here, quite a simple game in terms of rules, but the decision tree is almost overwhelming at first - with a lot of cogs and mechanisms spinning inside the game.  Be prepared for a lot of staring and saying "uhhh" in the first game, but it improves rapidly after that.  Having 27 craftsman in a game where only 9 appear ensures it should stay fresh, and kudos for at least feeling a little different from most of the stuff coming out these days.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My top game of 2010. The way dice are used is well done - the game turns the idea of "good rolls" and "bad rolls" completely on its head. Low rolls can be just as good as high rolls, and the game also gives players ways to change the result of rolls when a different result is needed (re-rolling and flipping). Players can also buy dice from other players for a cost that increases proportionally to the benefit that will be received. The game also uses cards to create a complex exchange rate system among the four other main game elements: pips, money, influence points, and victory points.

This game is vaguely reminiscent of one of my favourite games: [thing=27162][/thing].

The presentation seems rather lackluster.  The artwork reminded me of [thing=444][/thing], and was surprised that [boardgameartist=12282][/boardgameartist] was not part of the [thing=444][/thing] team.

Game play must be experienced.  Tons of dice rolling (which is the number one appeal to me), but the decisions to be made!  Players prone to AP will certainly experience those moments, but overall, downtime isn't bad - as long as you don't plan too far ahead!  It is almost as if you shouldn't decide what to do until it is your turn since the dice-pool created will look nothing like it did on your previous turn.

If you are looking for a deeper implementation of a familiar premise, this is the one for your collection.  If you are looking for something more approachable with much more appealing artwork, stick with [thing=27162][/thing].

RATING: 8
Good and very thinky dice rolling and dice manipulation game.  Not to mention dice stealing, dice re-rolling, dice flipping, and dice destruction.   There are two currencies (coins, influence) to manage.  Event cards are scored similar to the buildings in Blue Moon City.   Players have secret objectives but all players share in the scoring, so there is a little bit of deduction happening as well.  There is pseudo-worker placement and engine building.   Not so much engine building on a grand scale, but rather lots of action spaces that are like mini-machines.   There is a ton of choice in the game, which is going to give it a lot of appeal, I would think.   On the downside, it is utterly themeless and fairly ugly graphically (although it is stylized and well-done in a red/yellow/white/black color scheme, it just doesn't appeal to me, but it is unique).   A dream come true for AP players.

Worker placement combined with dice manipulation make for a game that includes a lot of fun player interaction. Being able to effectively steal other player's dice means you never feel comfortable with the engine you're building.

Troyes had some interesting ideas, with different-colored workers generating corresponding dice, which are rolled to produce actions.  It seems like there's not much point in having personal dice, though, if anyone can use anyone else's for any reason.  Having events that hurt everyone, but can be combatted for points if you don't like them is another nice touch.  It's just not a game I feel that much like playing.
Part of this is the cards, which are full of arcane symbols to tell you what they do, and the rulebook descriptions aren't great, as I recall.  Part of it is the way you have to keep fighting for spots in the buildings, endlessly trying to push out other players in a no-win zero-sum mess.  And if you do get pushed out of a number at once, you can find yourself in a situation where you aren't making any dice (or more than 1), and therefore have limited ability to get back in.
Anyway, that's just what I can recall from it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The puzzle is interesting each new round when the dice are rolled. Because all dice are rolled at the beginning, you get to think about what your opponents might do. Engines are hard to build and hard to run, providing tension and mitigating a runaway engine. The addition of guessing and bluffing about hidden (but shared!) goals is quite welcome. The rules overhead is a significant downside, and having to refer back to poorly-written rules throughout the game is onerous.

One of the most underrated games in my opinion. It is a worker/placement action selection Euro with gorgeous art and dozens of interesting mechanisms, some of which was not easy to remember but the game play is awesome. It has dice, swingy evil dice which would be annoying if not for wonderful mitigation mechanisms and player interaction which makes it all right. It is a gem.
Expansion Ladies of Troyes gives some more variation, a purple die to make the game easier and some gimmicky and unnecessary modules.

A neat little worker placement (dice placement!) game with a beautiful graphic design about medieval something or other. I love the 'use your neighbour's dice' mechanic and with the randomization of cards and objectives each game, it has some very high replay value. This is a complicated game with deep strategy that is more engrossing with each turn. Recommended for players familiar with the rules, otherwise playtime is long due to specific conditions for rules and iconography that can be confusing the first time around. Ladies of Troyes adds a ton of content, making this an excellent worker placement game.

I didn't care much for this although if you like Caylus or Puerto Rico, you should check it out. For my taste it has too much going on. There's about 20 cards that come into play every game, each one with a different function, some of them very wonky, similar to buildings in Caylus or Cuba. I know many love that, but for me it creates a learning curve that makes playing the game a chore. 0-1

The ultimate dice rolling euro.  At the beginning of the game, people will place workers in one of three buildings types: civilian, military, and religion.  For each person in a building you'll roll that many dice of the appropriate type.  These dice basically have 4 functions: to use with the activity cards, combat event cards, build the cathedral, and place more people into 3 building types.  Some of these options allow you to group multiple dice together and usually more pips will give you greater benefits (ala Stone Age).  The big twist with this game compared to other dice euros, is that you can pay resources to other players and use their dice.  The more dice you for a single action, the more expensive the price is for each individual dice you are purchasing.

There are strategic avenues to pursue but you really need to tactically adjust your plans based on what other people are doing and based on what dice are available on your own turn.  More than any other dice euro, high rolls will not determine a winner.  High and low rolls have benefits, though high rolls are typically better. Even though higher rolls are still typically more preferable, there are many ways to mitigate the luck such as: buying opponents high rolls, re-rolling/flipping your own dice using influence, and the unique aspects of some of the activity cards.

I find this game to have a higher replay value than a lot of other euro's in the fact that you only use 9 of the 27  activity cards each game (30 if you have the promo cards).  You will also only use a portion of the available secret goal and event cards.  That means each game, there will new combos to try and different incentives to maneuver in various ways. Troyes is better than Castles of Burgundy, Airships, Yspahan, and Kingsburg.  It's probably better than Alien Frontiers too but I have yet to play it.  You owe it to yourself to try this title.

RATING: 8.6
Every time I play this game I like it more because of the layers and depth of strategy it offers. Pros: Quick to set up; relatively simply to understand once you get used to the icons; replayability; depth and variety of strategy; the event cards offer a semi-cooperative aspect to the game where everyone is incentivized to overcome them as quickly as possible; when someone takes one or more of your dice it's not that bad because (1) they have to pay you for each die that they take, and (2) it adds to the strategy and tension in the game because you can't count on having all of your dice at the start of your next turn and when someone takes a die you were going to use you have to react and formulate a new strategy; the game scales very well, although it plays differently (which I like because it adds variety). So many positives! Cons: the rule book is TERRIBLE (a friend of mine and I tried to learn from the rules at the Dice Tower Con and it seemed so complicated to the point we almost gave up, then someone offered to walk us through the first round and it all made sense); on that note, it's not the easiest game to teach (maybe just having people watch you play a round would be the best way instead of trying to explain the game); someone might not like the "take that" feeling when someone grabs one of the dice in your district; an AP-prone person could get stuck thinking through the combinations of dice actions on any given turn.

Lots of fiddly bits that don't contribute to theme development.  Overly complex mechanisms coupled with moderately high luck factor made for unsatisfactory play.  Wanted to love this one due to its fabulous art, but in the end decided to trade.  This game makes me imagine Saint Petersburg before play testing; it's as though there is an unnecessary superstructure of complexity atop a potentially elegant game.  I can see potential in this game, but as it stands, it's a near miss.  Rating of 4.5 is my rating and my wife's as well.

A notable implementation of dice placement. With new cards becoming available each game, and various (though secret) scoring cards, variety is aplenty. However, the random drawing of actions cards injects loads of unnecessary randomness that players cannot anticipate and strategize around. The secret scoring card mechanic is neat and adds a layer of auxiliary strategy. This thoughtful gameplay more than makes up for the rather stale setting and flat art style. I like this game quite a bit, but it is simply outdone by its competition (most notably Steampunk Rally and Discoveries), making it difficult to justify much table time.

My first play of Troyes seems to suggest that the game does live up to its hype. It is a worker placement game, but its take on the genre is that it is more tactical than most WP games that I like. You are making long term strategical decisions, yes. But how well those pan out is determined by the luck of the roll and the allocation of your hard earned resources. On the whole, I'm pretty fed up with worker placement games; I find that the best WP games are just explicitly better than their counterparts. That being said, I may have room in my collection for another. 

Another play shows me that the game's tactical nature makes it shine. It's five turns long, and there is a lot of unknown information. That being said, you do not have much time to figure out what you want to do, and commit to it. What colors of dice you are getting will help you figure out what your best ideas will be, but you'll have to wait to see the events, the actions, and what your opponents do before you get an opportunity to act on what your best ideas may be. 

This game seems particularly unforgiving for first time players. Money can be a hard resource to acquire, I would suggest to beginners to look for investments for future turns, be it more dice, prestige, or money. 

My only complaint against this game is that I think its real sweet spot is at exactly three players. With four there is a lot of competition for the dice and the efficiencies that can be obtained are low. So low that the events can really plow you over. The game I have played with four was my least favorite play of this game so far. Conversely I am not interested in trying this title with two, as I think it would be boring. Troyes is a game about shortages, and with only two players (and the glut of dice that would be had with only two) the play would, IMO, detract from the true experience of Troyes. I'm pretty obsessive about optimal player numbers in games in general, though. 

8->9. I no longer consider three players essential, it may not even be the optimal number for me anymore. The tactics, lucky-but-not-too-lucky dice rolls, randomization of cards, and the seemingly mupltiple routes to victory really my plays of this title enjoyable.

Troyes brings in a whole host of previously-seen worker placement/action drafting elements and adds in a surprisingly confrontational dice sniping mechanic, all of which leads to a lot of variables to keep track of and the associated analysis paralysis.

Beautiful artwork!  And arguably the best gamers game of 2010, and don't let the make you think it's random just because it has dice!  (There is some randomness in the cards, but this also increases replayability).  Take dice management to the next level!  Nice balance between strategy and tactics - activity cards help determine your strategy, and dice rolls your tactics.  Troyes is for gamers in 2010 what Hansa Teutonica was in 2009: they are different, of course, but they are both successful euro games and occupy the same kind of niche and will appeal to the same kind of crowd.  Considerably heavier than games like Feld's Castles of Burgundy.

The best dice strategy game out there, hands down IMO. The game mixes worker placement with bonus power combinations and, well, a lot of other stuff into a strategic treat. The Achilles Heel of dice games, higher rolls, has finally been solved. High rolls are not necessarily better than low ones since people will be tempted to purchase your higher dice out from under you, and you can flip your low dice (e.g., 1 > 6). Three colors of dice are used in three different neighborhoods, each with a different contribution to the proceedings, and you manage two currencies, influence and money. You can pull off some slick moves in the game and I'm constantly engaged with what options I may or may not have when it comes to my turn. The mechanism of buying each other's dice makes for great tension in what move you should take now vs dice you'll leave exposed.

There's a steep learning curve with the iconography and the cards, so teaching is not the easiest. There's great variability in play as you only use a combination of 9 action cards each game (with the expansion cards which I recommend, that's 9 of 30 cards). While Castles of Burgundy also addresses the high-low dice issue, I find this one far more strategic, interactive, and overall engaging from turn to turn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Worker placement with a nice mix of longer term choices and tactical events.  While the dice have some influence over game play, there are plenty of ways to mitigate.  There is a fair amount of interactivity between the players as well, which makes it less of a solitaire experience.

Troyes is an innovative and rather complex euro game using dice for worker placement.  There are multiple scoring options both during and at the end of the game.  These offer a variety of paths to winning, but create a seeming mish-mash of opportunities and choices that make the whole process seem rather confusing at first.

Troyes probably gets better with repeat plays, but I gave this game away after two plays having many more enjoyable games in my collection.

Dice buying makes for lots of player interaction, almost too much as you try to sabotage the opponent (especially two player).

Like Lokomotive Werks, it uses dice in an interesting way to keep track of values. However, if you roll well and your opponents roll poorly your dice will all be bought from you before you get a chance to use them, leaving you with some worthless money that you can't use if it's the last round. At least that's what happened to me when I played.

This beautiful, aesthetically pleasing game places you in medieval France where you are a member of the nobility trying to influence the city of Troyes through religion, politics, and economy while helping fight off foreign invaders and stop destructive rebellions.

Not my kind of thing, too fiddly. But I can see why it's popular and 5 rounds is short and tight.

Although thematically a single-sentence description of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus]Caylus[/url] would almost fit here, Troyes is mechanically unique and original. It could be described as a two-step worker placement game: you place workers to get dice which you then use to activate actions (reminiscent of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27162/kingsburg]Kingsburg[/url]). Alternatively, we could define it as a collection of simultaneous area-majority mini-games, as a gamer friend of mine once did. There are two dozen multicolored dice in the box, but chance does not dominate the game; their real role is to expand the decision tree. As in many other eurogames, you have to feed (in this case, "pay") your workers, but money flows around fast enough due to the constant buying of each other's dice. Troyes has a nice sense of narrative coming from the progressively interesting and powerful actions that are discovered in turns 1 to 3. It is a dynamic puzzle which grows before our eyes. I'm a fan of Alexandre Roche's art in the board and cards: it helps in sustaining a veneer of theme on what is essentially a complex abstract game. I must admit this game is not the most elegant and intuitive design out there: every time I play it, I have to consult the rule book a couple of times during the game to check one of its many small-print details. Nevertheless, Troyes is still one of my favorite eurogames ever and my enjoyment only grows each time I play.

I just recently played Alien Frontiers (another dice game that allocates the dice according to the pips).  Where Alien Frontiers is a light to medium weight game that tends to drag on, this one is a strong medium weight game with more strategy and not enough time!  This is  more of a gamer's game of area control and resource management, with military engagements, co-operation, deduction, and bluffing.

Numerous options are available every turn.  Or so it seems at the beginning--but options start dwindling and it is a race to get what you want.  

Your best dice will likely be bought from underneath you, so a little hard to plan your turn until it rolls around.  However the game allows for a clever change of numbers on your dice by turning the dice upside down (with a cost, of course).  So even though it is a dice game, this ability to change the numbers so drastically removes it from strongly luck-based dice games which I don't like.

This is another game where learning the cards and especially card combinations is important, which means frequent plays is better than pulling it out once in a long while.  Luckily it is short enough (sometimes an hour), so that a couple of games can be played in an evening.

There is a lot going on in this game.  Players must work together to keep potentially run-away winners at bay--not a good game for those who like to plan a course of action and stick to it.  This is also a subtle game of deduction!  Everyone gets a secret victory point goal, a goal that all can benefit from.  If players can determine other's goals and take advantage, then end of game VP tallying can have a surprise ending.  Therefore, a bit of bluffing can also enter the game.  This is also a math game with conversions between money/influence/VP, and can lead to a bit of pondering.  

The only reason I'd play a two-player game again is to learn the cards better.  

A simple, attractive game with nice components.  Extremely well balanced. Many facets of play and a changing setup, makes replay-ability high.  For me a strike against it, is that if I am an infrequent player, it's hard to beat a player who knows the cards and card combinations.  And if players don't cooperate, more than likely there will be a runaway winner--so your crowd has to be right, otherwise the same person might win every time.

Edit:  Rating raised.

Throwing quite a lot of dice, and still hardly any luck involved. Understanding all cards can be a bit difficult at first, but once used to the symbols, it plays much smoother. Each game is also quite different than the one before, due to other activity & event cards and their order during play. And of course the many possible actions of your opponent(s).

After first play, I immediately wanted to give it another try. And kept these first couple of games in mind for days. The only reason I'm not giving it a straight 10 is that in one of these (2 player) games there was a runaway leader, doing massive damage using a two-card combo, while the other player couldn't do something about it. We finished this game early as it was no point continuing.

A pity that my girlfriend doesn't like this game at all, so it'll probably not get played as much as I would like.

Why does everyone love this game?  Maybe we played it wrong.  I played this at BGG Con 2010 and 2 of us ended up getting screwed.  The first two players went first twice and their scores were well into the 40s where as myself and the other guy who didn't go first twice were barely in the 20s.  I hated it felt so unbalanced.  ... will replay if I can find someone who knows the rules.

Innovative fusion of 'bucket o' dice' and Euro.  Good thematic connection between activity cards and their effects; and nice medieval aesthetic to game illustrations.  
A pleasant blend of a well-themed Stone Age, and an Agricola/LeHavre w/ a reasonable playing time.

Doesn't seem to be quite enough cardboard currency for 4p, though -- in truth you usually end up having enough, but there's just too much trading back and forth with the bank for needed denominations.  Poker chip currency recommended.

"DICE THAT AREN'T DICE"

-Some buddy: 24 dice??? has a lot of luck???
-BGG  buddy: not an all!!! it's Troyes!!!

A game that uses 24 dice but where luck factor isn't determinant at all, must be called "Dice wich aren't dice". This fact, indeed, is enough for me to take my hat out off my head and say two things:
-Firstly (to the creators): "Congratulations. What an original piece of board-gaming-art!"
-Secondly (to Parker Brother's spawns and shit like that): "Look what kind of use you could give to dice... Learn something of Troyes"

I'm in love with this game! Imho: The better dice game ever! In fact, they should have called this game: "Dice that aren't dice". All it's mechanics are so well designed and combines in such perfect ways!

One of the thing I like the most about Troyes is that it has too many ways to get VP (victory points) but you always have to fight against your oponents in order to get them... Yeah, in Troyes there's a lot of interaction-confrontation between players and, speaking by myself, I really love it!.

Another strong aspect: In Troyes you can earn not just the yet classical VP (victory points), but IP (influence points) also, and the ways you can spend them during the game has been so well thought, that even now, after have been played arround 25 games, still surprises me, and it's because it can be possible to changing an apparently bad situation in just seconds, of course just if you planify well, but not just what to do, but when to use that valuable IP.  

In addition: It's components are nice and of good quality and I love that kind of medieval artwork-style that fits in such a perfect way with the theme of the game.

In resume: a must have for lovers of "german-style" board games.

A Troyes kivitelezése nagyon szép, és elég egyedi a grafikája. Ez valakinek nem annyira tetszik, ugyanis egy csöppet sötét, komor a hangulata. A játék során munkásokat rakunk le, az egyre több akciólehetőség valamelyikére és/vagy használjuk őket. A játékban a várost külső veszély fenyegeti, ami minden körben egyre több szívást generál a játékosoknak. A veszéllyel közösen többé-kevésbé megküzdve, kell minél több pontot szerezni az öt körös játék végére. 
- A játék nagyon szép, de valóban kicsit komor
- A játékszabályok meglehetősen bonyodalmasak, nem gémereknek szerintem esélytelen megtanítani őket
- A játék nagy előnye pl. az alien frontiers-hez, képest, hogy van valamennyi lehetpőséged a másik köre alatt is előre gondolkodni, így lénygesen kevesebb a holt idő.
- A véletlenszerű akciókártyák meglehetősen nagy újrajátszási faktort adnak a játékhoz

Sajnos nem sikerült még az agyamnak megfelelő dice placement-tet találni. A túl sok lehetősget szinte képtelenség áltátni, és ez rengeteg gondolkodást, és a játék végére teljes brain burn-t eredményez. A játék után hazajöttem, és bedőltem az ágyba. :)
Érdekelnek az általam csak dice placement-nek nevezett játékok, de valahogy eddig egyik se tudod felhőtlen szórakozást generálni. Ettől függetlenül a Troyes egy jó játéknak tartom, amit ha megvenni nem is fogok, befogható maradok egy-egy játékra.

RATING: 6
The unusual use of dice is what sets Troyes apart from other resource conversion games. The dice provide resources but can also be purchased from other players who may then end up without any resources themselves. This novel mechanism is bolted onto a fairly normal foundation of worker placement and resource conversion.

Troyes is a dice game, and what players roll does matter, but there are three points that reduce the impact of dice results. Firstly, the ability to (forcibly) buy them off other players means you can get supplies you need from elsewhere, secondly, there are quite a few buildings you can use to modify die results when you have workers present, and thirdly, there are usually options available even for low rolls.

The game is a bit schizophrenic in that it goes to great lengths to lessen the impact of the dice which ultimately sort of turns it into "yet another resource conversion game" (TM). The implementation of a neat game mechanism is somewhat more noteworthy than the game as a whole. That is not to say it's a bad game, though.

Mage Knight has caused me to reassess my thoughts on this game because I feel the two games are related enough in mechanics that playing the one has given me a greater understanding of what I love about the other.

This game is about algebra applied thematically. I love the game in the same way I love working in an excel spreadsheet. It is a matter of figuring out how to best use the numbers available to you on the board. The variability is great because of the cards available from game to game and how they work with each other.

The downsides to this game are not having anyone to play it with, and a theme that is just not very exciting to me, although it is well implemented enough that I don't mind it. I traded it away so it would stop collecting dust on my shelf.

Dice utilization Euro with a lot of moving parts.  Depending on where your workers are locating, you gain dice each turn for your worker's locations.

There's also a lot to do each turn, so working through your choices and implementing it effectively is quite a challenge.

Played the last game with 4 players, and it was a far less great experience: analysis paralysis, turning this into that and back, it was a looonnnggg game. Endscore was 37-38-39-40! You can call this endscore exciting, but for us it was experienced like "apparantly I won/lost, but I cannot reproduce how".

Received via FedEx from BoardsandBits.com on January 6, 2011. Have now read the rules through twice, set it up, worked through a turn, and read all the Q&A's on the 'geek.
The more I've understood it, the more excited I am to play it. This looks like a good one - but still haven't had a chance to play it (1/8/11). 
March 1, 2011 - 3 plays later, I really like it. One of the better games from Essen 2011, but not sure how often this will get played. After three quick plays, it got shuffled to the back in favor of London, Navegador, and 7 Wonders. However, I hope to get it back into play once those games get over their initial shine.

Have now played it 4 times and am playing it for a fifth time at work (during lunch breaks). I have to say it has now surpassed London and Navegador for me. I still love 7 W, but it doesn't have the depth of Troyes. 7W is what it is - my favorite "quickie." But when i want a main dish - Troyes is currently at the top of the menu!

Terrible rules, esp. the German rules. Grafics are a joke to me. Game play, once you make it thru the rules, is at best mediocre. I see some serious flaws with win strategies, as money is no issue and once a player finds a good strategy, everyone can instantly "buy" into this strategy and copy it.

I really do not get the hype on this one.

Troyes was a bit of a letdown. It feels like a game that is disconnected from itself in many different places. Honestly, none of the parts of the game made any coherent sense to me at that point. It turns out it is a rather easy game to understand, but by the end I felt that the parts of the game just didn't come together to make any sort of fluid game. I like that it has replayability in terms of the action cards, but it is such a mash of dozens of ways to make points and I don't think one really knows how to play this game well until they've played it quite a few times and see the interplay between actions that really have no solid connection on the outset. Troyes, in that sense is a weird game for me: it has all the elements of games I like, but just fell flat. In the end, I just didn't have any fun. I felt I had spent two hours trying to crunch the mechanics. That experience isn't something I normally shy away from, but I felt Troyes lacked tension almost the entire time, which made it a somewhat boring experience. I didn't feel particularly rewarded when I made a rather complex move as it just seemed like the best thing at the time given what I was given. To sum it up, Troyes is a solid game, very well-thought out, obviously designed by experts in the field, and a total boring experience. I would play again, but perhaps with three players (instead of four) to see if the increase of control and quickness of turns would keep the life going in this one.

Takes all that is good with Caylus, and marries it to all that is good with Kingsburg.  This is the dice management game for hard core gamers. Awesome game that presents multitudes of choices each round, coupled with a large variability in actions each game, multiple strategies to explore.  Brilliant.  

Makes Kingsburg, and even Alien Frontier unnecessary.

Now I need to go play Royal Palace and Carson City.

Rating lowered after playing it a 4th time... it was really boring!  Seems odd after my previous plays, but that's just the way it felt.

------

Played 3 times.  Giving it a 8 for now.  

It is may be the most thematically rich eurogame I have every played. It does something very interesting with dice. The replayibiility issue is resolved well by enabling the use of only 9 of 27 possible “action spaces” (represented by cards) in a single game. Additionally the end-game victory rewards are variable (but not too variable) too.

Troyes reminds me of Discworld Ankh Morpuk in the secret character power at the beginning of the game. It is a dice driven Euro with a small degree of control due to dice randomness and a high degree of player interaction (not quite reaching the interaction of Die Macher but close). Troyes has some of the dice manipulation of Alien Frontiers but where card abilities are shared instead. All in all a chaotic and random Euro with a difficult to manage but well put together game.

Really good, although I constantly find myself looking for stategy in this game, but I only find tactics.

Just the right amount of interaction, many avenues available to take. The game has a variety of cards and roles so that it's a little different each time. I also feel like the game doesn't over stay it's welcome(Okay, maybe with 4 players). It does feel a bit like a math problem at times, and with so many avenues it can subject players to analysis paralysis. Some cards are also a bit questionable in terms of their balance, but for such a robust game I think they did a fine job. Just not my cup of tea, I don't have too much fun with it and am trading it away

Somewhat chaotic dice-based scoring mechanics, which reminds me of Masons.  You're looking for the best use of a color of dice, from a pool of all players dice, potentially stealing away (via purchase) other players dice during the round.  I found the game entirely forgettable, although I know people who like these types of problems.  Some actions are stored up for later use, and so there are definitely some creative ways to try and make more potent scoring moves.  There's enough flexibility that the rolls themselves are rarely frustrating, which is nice for a die-rolling game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Way too much time needed to invest in a repetitive game where you can get unduly influenced by random events and other players secret victory conditions.  Have to become familiar with many cards and complex VP/$/influence conversions. Have to analyze too many different event/activity conversions to play fast or fun.  Kingsburg, while not the world's greatest game, is much faster and funner, and the learning curve not nearly so steep. 

Once again, I don't understand the hype. If you're a "gamer" who has played every Euro and needs a new fix I suppose, have at it.  If you're looking for fun or a game that is not a math exercise, look elsewhere.

Preliminary rating after one 4p game. A little apprehensive at first glance, as it appears to be yet another dice-driven resource converting exercise in the same vein as Kingsburg. But there's far more going on here. Stealing -- or rather buying, as your hapless opponent gets a fair price -- other players' dice is the standout feature here. Strangely, the secret endgame VP goals and the comboriffic exploits-- features I typically scorn -- don't bother me in this one. The confusing iconography unfortunately create an obstacle in getting through that first play. Overall, pretty impressive.

Update: God, what got into me? Playing this again a year later, I realize it's spreadsheet euro through and through. Pretty lifeless.

Nice worker placement game with enough tweaks to stand out from the pack.The storyline works and the dice mechanism is excellent, smooth and intuitive. Lovely components and clear rules but complex intermeshed mechanisms (esp the tradesman cards) mean it is bewildering for your first game or two.  Fiddlyness and potential AP may preclude its rise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent worker placement/efficiency game with just the right balance of potential options, resourses (which enables you to actually do the options) and available actions. Although the workers are represented by dice, the ablity to influence the scores balances the luck aspect and makes for very tense play. The iconography on the cards makes the available actions very clear after just a short period of playing, and the range of cards, only a few of which are used each game, makes for varied play. The rules are well laid out and clear. Components are excellent. Great game.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Wow...so many options and things to do. Dice rolls are indeed not so important here, although they DO save you some resources. Because of the number of actions you may take, I feel that AP may be a problem. I kind of like that players are forced to waste resources defending the town from invaders, it adds some tension and some frustration not being able to use what you rolled to your advantage.

Everything is rewarded and punished...it's difficult to see a long term strategy. More plays are needed.

Two player games are actually pretty good and the last few turns have some dice acquisition competition going on. I think I may like this better than Alien Frontiers as a slightly heavier game, even if not as easy to teach or read the rulebook. (I hate hate hate the rulebook for this! It's not even that long, just a chore! With bad examples too. (Mismatched pictures in my edition.)

I had read and learned the rules and found it difficult to teach without having played it yet.  I enjoyed the choices present during game play and even if your dice rolls were bad, there was still stuff you could do (modify your dice, buy dice from other players).

Rating after 1 play with 2 players - and at least 3 wrong rules :) I put this in the same category as Alien Frontiers (which I rate higher - and is more non-gamer friendly). Troyes is definitely a gamers game. Beautiful artwork - but a lot going on. Requires a lot more planning ahead and more combinations that can happen than in AF.

Fellow user Canales recomended me this dice game several months ago. I love dice games, and I did love Burgundy so I expected a lot from Troyes. And it is really an excellent game, more original than Burgundy although I like both the same. Excellent innovative dice game with almost no luck and many clever mechanics. A bit hard for the non gamer, Troyes is a delicious gamers game. Theme fits perfectly and I love the design as well (the box is wonderful and fits perfectly besides my Caylus Deluxe).

I bumped my rating up on this game after my second play.  I think the first time I played it I remember admiring it as a well made game, but not necessarily enjoying it.

Second time, I got done with it, and just wanted to play again.  I think it feels very unique.  While it's a thoughtful, difficult game with a steep learning curve, you generally feel like there is more good stuff to do than you are able to do, and you are sort of choosing between good, better, and best.  

I don't feel immersed in the theme of the game, and at some level, that part of it is unimaginative to me, but whatever.  The mechanics are cool, and it doesn't totally feel like any other game I have.

The absolute cream of the dice-rolling Euro crop. Even moreso than in Kingsburg or especially Alien Frontiers, you cannot roll bad dice in Troyes. It's very much a game about adapting your tactics to the dice you (and your opponents) do roll, rather than a game about how well you roll dice.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game.  Unique dice mechanics.  Deep strategy.  Lots of variety and replayability.  Works well with 2P and up.  Very close games.

UPDATE: My wife and I aren't in love with the theme in this one.  It's a little dry, and the medieval artwork doesn't seem to help us identify with our character cards or care much about what's going on in the city, or feel much threat from the black dice.  Mechanically, the game is incredible.  Strategically, it's deep.  Thematically?  I guess it's just not as much fun in this regard as it could have been.  But we enjoy the game and so far have decided to keep and pull it out on occasion.  I'm interested to see if more players will improve our feeling of it any.

UPDATE:  It's been a few months since our last play. We played last night and had the same "meh" feeling throughout the game.  There was plenty of tension, hard decision-making, moments of press your luck, plenty of thinky puzzles, and solid competition, but we just didn't feel like we cared about the city all that much, more like we were just going through the motions of the game, maybe more like a math puzzle.  We played Yedo the previous evening and in some ways the games are similar: they each have cards with symbols on them :P, but in Yedo, each card has a bit of story on it, and somehow this really pulls us into the game and encourages us to care about our clan and reinforce the ideas that we're competing against other clans and reminds us that we want to be the best clan in the city, so that's why we're making all of these moves.

I'm not 100% sure if we're going to trade this one away yet or not.  I appreciate the game for a long list of reasons, but I'm frustrated that I"m not in love with it and I really want to know why.  :P  

UPDATE: we decided to sell the game.  While we appreciate it for its unique use of dice as worker placement, we decided that it doesn't have enough theme for us, and the mechanics are too mathematical and the iconography too hard to remember and interpret, which further removes us from the theme.  Sad to see this one go, but hopefully the next person will enjoy it more.

RATING: 8.5
Troyes is a weird game. At its core, it's what I call an "Ystari game" for lack of a better term. I'm referring to the type of game in which the players take turns doing small actions: earning money or influence or victory points or goods, or converting one of these into another, or putting a dude on the board that will generate more of these things later on. Caylus is the obvious example, but many of the games published by Ystari follow this general pattern. They are games that give players a broad menu of actions, and challenge them to use those actions in the most efficient way possible.

I typically don't like that style of game, so my labeling something "an Ystari game" is usually a criticism. But Troyes features one marvelous innovation that makes it truly interesting. In Troyes, the menu of actions is contained within each player's handful of dice. And we're not just talking about dice with action icons like War of the Ring. In Troyes, each of the three colors of dice can be used for several different actions. The effects of these actions will depend upon the number of dice you're able to use, the numbers showing on those dice, and the particular cards available on the board.

While playing Troyes, I've found that almost every turn presents tricky decisions. It's difficult to know what to do first, because other players can purchase your dice right out from under you, and of course you can do the same to them. There are a couple different ways to manipulate the numbers on the dice, but you're only allowed to modify your own dice. This means that rolling "badly" is sometimes better than rolling "well." Your good rolls will quickly be scooped up by your opponents, while your bad rolls can be changed into good rolls once you're ready to use them.

Troyes is remarkably polished and developed for a game from a new publisher and three young designers (Sébastien Dujardin, Xavier Georges, and Alain Orban). But there are a couple minor points that some gamers might call flaws. First, going early in the turn order is a strong advantage, and despite a rotating start player, not everyone gets an equal crack at it. Secondly, there is occasional strangeness surrounding the secret patrons that will award points for various achievements at the end of the game. You can try to predict which patrons will score based on your opponents' actions (each players knows about one of them, but everyone scores for each patron that's in the game). But if one of your opponents is doing a poor job of catering to their patron's whims, then you'll probably guess wrong, and the point awards may feel arbitrary or random.

Is it a sacrilege for me to put this game in my top-10 after only one play? And if so, how high? It's nowhere near as elegant as Concordia and far more fiddly, but there the decision space is so much deeper here. I would argue that replayability is higher too. Compared to Orleans, there is far less randomness, but the games give me completely different feelings. One is stressful (Troyes), the other lighthearted (Orleans). Depending on my mood, this could rank above or below those two. Regardless, I am glad to say I own this and there is nothing like this in my collection.

Troyes is a very good strategy game that uses dice in a clever way.
The goal of the game is to have the most victory point.  It can be overwhelming at first because there's so many things that you can do during your turn.

I love the use of the dice in this game!  Not too random, you can use influence point to re-roll dice.  You can also buy dice from other player.
I also like that the activity cards are different each game so you have to adjust your strategy depending on what is available.

RATING: 10
Maybe my favourite game. I love having a proponent of chance in strategy games. The dice and the random selection of activity/event cards keep every game feeling fresh and exciting, yet the game is nuanced enough for proper strategies to be formed.

If you like being slapped upside the head by drought and heresy, or if you like games that allow players to be creative with their moves, you should check out Troyes!

The only con I can think of is that Troyes might take a couple plays to really feel at home with the mechanisms. For some people, the first game can leave a confusing taste, so teach it well and offer lots of tips!

I like the design of the mechanisms and how they interlock, there is also a decent amount of player interaction. I didn´t like the artwork and found the iconography not as intuitive as it could be.
It´s not really possible to follow a certain strategy as a bad die roll (or even a great one) would not work (either too few pips or so many that other player
will buy your dice, leaving you with money but no dice.) My first play was already with the purple die from the 
expansion which is on one hand a joker and on the other it cannot be bought by your fellow players (and somehow saved the game from a bad rating).
The problem in general is: it was not that fun. The game is bone dry and the theme is barely present. You count and try to optimize your turn with pushing around some cubes. Playing early in a turn is important, going last sucks. I am an Eurogamer but this big dice game felt really dryer as others like Kingsburg or Stone Age. Will I play again? Yes, but not that soon.

RATING: 7.7
Very interesting "dice" game. One would think that luck had most to do with it and partially it's true, but only very very partially. 

The randomicity of the game has been remarkably limited, so if you'll play well there will be no amount of bad rolls that will make you lose. 

I give this game a 7.5 after one play, because of: 1) its relative complexity; 2) its length in time. 

Future plays may make the rating go up, or down.

UPDATE
My girlfriend was in Troyes, she asked me if I wanted it. I said: "who am I to turn down a gift from out of the clear sky?", so there it is, I own this now. :)

Finnally got to play it again. What BEAUTIFUL components! I really love the back of the cards and the board.

There's a good game in here, but I have taught this to three groups of people who have all since refused in practice to play it again. It's not a fun game to teach repeatedly, and it is especially unforgiving to inexpert play. Basically, the symbology in this game is like a brick wall. Will continue to attempt to get this to the table, but I may soon give up.

EDIT: Sold off, but rebought at MSRP after it was OOP. Tentatively, we tried it again....and loved it! The criticisms above still stand; symbology is obscure, and there is a distinct advantage to knowing some of the synergies beforehand. But for all that, it's a game that snowballs in interest the more you play it, and a great example of the "mitigated luck" genre of Eurogame. Great fun.

This is also one of the few games I have that seems to work just as good with 3-players as with 4-players.

Unique use of dice creates a good game full of strategy and interesting decisions. Looks abstract at first, but once you know the rules you'll notice the theme, which is in every action you can do.

I really like playing this game but a few people that I have introduced the game to have a hard time wrapping their heads around it.  Some have a hard time forging a path to victory.

They are willing to play again but only a few more plays will tell if this will hit the table frequently.

RATING: 3
A dice allocation game where rolling high numbers is strictly better than rolling low. That is never a good thing, especially in a game where you roll your dice only six times. You can get dice from your opponents or flip yours, but these options cost valuable resources. Besides, it may be annoying when you are the player whose dice are taken.

The cards are wildly unbalanced and require dice of a determined color, but you must choose your initial dice with no information on which cards will be available. Of course, you may get more dice during the game, but you may also lose them as the other players take theirs, and there is nothing you can do to prevent that.

All in all, I found the amount of randomness just unacceptable for a such an overly long, complex and convoluted game. And the bad iconography surely does not help. Also, the ugly art and generic medieval theme fail to disguise the complete abstractness. For dice placement, I will take "Kingsburg" or "Alien Frontiers" over this any time.

It moves at a nice clip, and the dice system is indeed rather innovative (it's not as similar to Kingsburg as people would have you believe). The cards do provide an awful lot of variability.
The biggest strike against Troyes for me is that the game feels too much like point-mongering--there are 27 ways to score points, and your job is to eke slightly more points out of each transaction. That's not bad per se, but I'm a little burned out on such exercises--which I guess goes to show how much of a jaded Eurogamer I am, because Troyes really does have a fair number of strengths.

I 'needed' a dice euro in my collection and the extra meat/replayability of Troyes is more my style when compared to Alien Frontiers or Kingsburg, even if it is  a mathy brain burner at times. One complaint is inconsistency of iconography - miller versus tax collector for example or joust vs procession.

While I hate the luck of dice, this game gets around it in a very nice and interesting way, so that it doesn't feel luck-based at all. In fact, I played it many times and I could always get around it, no matter the die rolls, which proves it being less luck dependent as one might think.

Hidden scoring cards give a nice guideline for a long-term strategy. The blocking comes not only in using action spaces but also by buying dice. And I just have to add that the art is beautiful. This game is very pretty to look at. (23.4.2017)

A good themeless euro resource conversion game. Convert resources (here dice) into other resources (money, prestige) and into vp. Short but some interesting decisions - the achilles heel is that it is essentially about spotting the useful combos and grinding them out. All else is just tactically managing the dice. Also, multiple hidden scoring cards is crappy idea. Make the game all about the hidden scoring and deduction, or just leave it out.

Fun, brain-busting strategy here as you look to manipulate and optimise dice, which function as your workers in this excellent worker-placement game. You never feel at the peril of the dice, due to the clever mechanics, and there is excellent replayability due to the varying worker placement options available in each game. Plays well at any player count.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this but the problems are too much for it to overcome. Hugely turn order dependent especially with three players.  Maybe that would be fixed with 4?  The iconography would be better replaced with text.  The luck factor with the dice is super low, it really doesn't contribute much randomness to the game.  Your choices each turn are restricted a little by the results of your rolls, but depending on the board situation it won't effect anything.  Overall with the dice flipping/ reroll mechanic you can fix any particularly unlucky turns.  So why are we using dice in the first place, if the only thing they do is very rarely screw someone?   Finally, the math is obnoxious.  Yes its only counting pips and dividing by 3, 4, or something, but when you are evaluating a dozen or so possible moves thats a lot of silly math, especially when you consider the possibilities of stealing dice.   I would like to try it again to make sure but i do not think it is for me.

What did I like about it?  Although the rulebook isn't presented in the most understandable way, once you got going it was very intuitive for its level of complexity.  It also had a lot of different ways to win and different strategies, which was my favorite thing about the game.  I did not invest in military dice at all during our game, and instead concentrated on a strategy that allowed me to steal other player's dice for cheap.  Then I snagged a couple spots that let me turn those dice into money and victory points and I had a little engine going.  The other players were concentrating on defeating the event cards and using military dice to do different things.  I believe the fact that I was left alone to my own devices contributed to my win, otherwise I think the strategies were pretty equal.  Definitely the strong point of this game, the multiple different strategies.  It has some fantastic replayability in my opinion.

The too long, didn't read version is that I didn't like it, but it had some good ideas.  I want to play it again in case I am selling it short in some way.  Obviously it is very highly rated, so maybe I am?

A lot of this game depends on the luck of the dice rolls.  And even if you get lucky with your dice, they can be stolen away by other players!  Not a good combo.

In my first play, I was a little overwhelmed by the various possible areas that one can focus on.  I'm not sure what a good strategy would be.  I barely won my second game, and I think this is because I collected a lot of dice and money early, so I wouldn't have to worry about not having the dice that I needed.

I read that this was everything Alien Frontiers wanted to be. Well, I'm not quite sure if Alien Frontiers wanted to be anything else than exactly what it is, it's quite an awesome game. Nevertheless, Troyes is also quite awesome; I like it even better than Alien Frontiers, I think.

What's neat is how the game uses plenty of dice and randomness in a way that allows for a lot of strategy and planning. Stealing each other's dice is fun, too.

RATING: 8
Simple and neat, better than some euro dice games (like Kingsburg or Yspahan) but lacks a little narrative to be outstanding.  It's a solid cube pusher, where the theme is somehow believable; it's much better in this regard than Lords of Waterdeep, a game where the theme is simply not there (and I love fanhtasy themes); in Troyes, there is some coherence between what you do and the theme, simply the link is very thin.

RATING: 2
Wasn't convinced after the first play; second play confirmed this was a stinker.  2 points for the nice art and three language rulebook (French, German, English).

Game is way too long for what it is, an advanced worker placement game, in which you can become a spectator after the 1st turn (out of 6).

Re-read the rules (in both French and English) after first game to ensure we were playing this correctly.  Perhaps we just had unlucky event draws??  With no influence to modify/re-roll poor dice rolls, and not enough cash to make a decent die combo, was relegated to the status of spectator, trying to wrestle workers from other players who had Influence, Workers and cash to spare....  Uphill battle to attempt to stay on the positive side of the VP score...

Started off with 4 "Workers" in town, lost 3 (max you can lose in a turn) due to other player placements/actions, and managed to recoup one.

Started 2nd turn with 2 workers (dice), Influence wiped out by event, 7$, and attacking units tied up 1 out of 2 dice.  With my last die, was able to place one worker, and I lost 1 during the turn, thus down to two at start of 3rd turn.

Influence event still in force, wiped out my Influence, again.  "Invading" units wiped out my dice.  With one point of influence, little money, and no dice to generate income, I had to pass after trying to get another worker in town...  Half the game gone, 2 VP showing....  

Finished the game with 3 VP, about 25 points behind 3rd place.  Was never able to recoup the loss of 3 dice in the 1st turn.

Game winner, in both games, was the player with the most dice, from turn to turn.  Out of 4 players, 2 are in the race to win, the other 2 are unable to catch up and are mere spectators.

Will not be playing this one again.  For trade.

In an ever growing sea of Euro economic optimization (which are sometimes economic snowball games), it's refreshing to see (and play) a game which still looks, feels, and plays like a economic/resource conversion Euro without either the (single-player-solitaire) sandbox or the snowball (i.e., make money engine, convert to points mid-to-late game) formula. Rather, this is an interactive (through buying other player's dice, thus messing with potential plans) and non-snowballing (resource) economies (i.e., while the values of particular resources change in response to which patrons appear, it modifies the valuation in a linear rather than exponential manner). As the patrons that appear each game are different, there is no preset narrative to play within (I'm looking at you Agricola and Le Havre) but rather this games requires an ability to respond tactically to the way in which the game flows. Also, while I realize that the art might be love/hate, I find it very fresh, distinct, and beautiful.

Troyes is a clever dice management/strategy game that my entire family enjoys playing.  I enjoy games that provide many choices during a turn, and this provides just that.

I suppose there are times were AP occurs, but generally the time of each turn is minimal.

If I based my rating on the first 2 or 3 games alone, it would definitely be a 10.  I found it that enjoyable.  However, the cards involved are limited -- from the event cards to the character cards.  Therefore, I can see this being a game that might get a little stale sooner than expected.  It is disappointing that they did not provide more possibilities in this regard.

Very good euro game. It's just that i don't enjoy euros very much.

The dice stealing/re-rolling & turning mechanic is really good. Because it means the game is going to be nasty!

Also it is nicely short & tight!

There were many good aspects, but two very disturbing things: a) rulebook and b) you could not plan properly ahead, because there was too much change during other players turn. Therefore the game was too long for me. However, others might like it.

Based on (1) solo 3-player game, I am starting this at a 7.5.

This is a very interesting Euro, with a lot going on, and which came very close between the players- even though I admittedly do not have a great concept of what I was doing or why yet. ;-)

The initial choices of dice placement, changing choices based on events and dice limitations are all thing I am going to need more plays to get a better handle of- but it is interesting enough to guarantee I will get those plays in.

A neat game- not an instant winner, but definitely with a lot of potential to gain in rating as I get those plays in.  Worthwhile investment.

I got quite into this and was easily considering voting 7.5 by the half way point. There were tough tactical decisions in every round.

Unfortunately I didn't realise at the start of the game the necessity of getting 2 high valued red spaces or the necessity to get and generate influence reliably. This said I think that even if I play it better next time there are inherent problems with the game.

Money is far too easy to come by, you can be making 10+ a turn quite easily and unless you have enough influence there is nothing that can be done with it, furthermore there is no way of turning money into influence.

So you have a larger than necessary (even to get you 6 VPs on the money bonus card at the end of the game) going into the last turn. Well as first player that's fine, who cares what dice you had when you can pay 18 and steal three off other people?

This makes going first in the final round a little over powered and tarnishes the overall quality of the game

upon second playing I got even more into this, and then realised that my innitial assesment is even more true than I had thought for that final round or so

Money is just not scarce enough

----

It would seem that the first couple of times of playing we just had a strange combination of cards come out which made money so abundent. It's actually a pretty decent game. Perhaps if there were some way in the set up phase of making it so that they come out with a better distribution then it would be better still.

It was better with 2 than it was with four though I can see that the BGG consensus of best with 3 is probably correct.

Lots more analysis and blocking could be done with the lower number of players, it's the same reason I love Stone age with 2

Probably the best Euro I have played. The mechanics not only compliment each other but are so well balanced that no strategy beats any other. They also result in such a large variety of possible decisions with every turn. Not only can you choose between professions, events or the cathedral, you can also buy other dice and flip dice etc. No two people will play this alike and no two games will ever be the same.

A fun combination of Caylus and Castles of Burgundy with a lot of variety and fantastic art. This one will quickly rise in the ratings for me!

[b]Update:[/b] I seem to not consider that combat is a pretty integral part of the game. I focus a lot on the activity cards and the character goals while forgetting that the activity cards should be used to better combat. I need to pay more attention to that next time I play.

[b]Update 2:[/b] Played it with more than 2 and I think I have solidified why this game never turns out being the game I think it is. There's too many instances where it just beats you down. I look at the cards and I think of all of the combos I want to do, but between the events and the other players stealing dice, I never seem to be able to get much done and so always end the game feeling like it was incomplete. Essentially, I don't like how much I suck at this game :)

Great worker placement using dice. One of the best of Essen 2010
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
PRO:
- the mix of worker placement, action cards and dice as resources may sound like any other eurogame, but the game concept feels incredibly fresh and different
- medieval theme fits wonderfully, actions make sense in what they are supposed to represent
- the game just "flows" very naturally, once you have grasped the rules
- lots of player interaction (buying and selling dice, taking positions in buildings)
- simple game winning condition: most victory points win
- medieval look, beautiful art concept
- high re-playability factor thanks to different event, action and bonus cards
- dice as resources, but luck factor is minimized
- plays surprisingly fast (around 90 minutes with 4 players)
- almost no downtime, you don't have to wait long for the next turn
- (partly) hidden victory points add to the tension

CONTRA:
- not the game you want to teach to non-gamers, due to "different from usual"-kind of rules

VERDICT:
I absolutely love this game. You always have an option to pursue, because there's always a way to win victory points, even though your opponent just did THAT move that you wanted to take yourself. It feels so fresh and new, there's almost no downtime... an instant classic!

1.起始每人一張角色卡(兩人遊戲兩張)!!!角色卡任務每人都可以計分!!!!
   影響力4點，5元
=>放市民由起始順時針放再逆時針回來
!!!事件卡4人6張，3人5張，2人4張!!!
最終計分: a,行動卡上市民分數 b.角色卡每人都算 c.未被解決事件卡1張1分 d.大教堂扣分。
2. 遊戲流程
A.翻開行動卡
B.領10元，付薪水
C.執骰(包含中立玩家)
D.解決事件卡(從起始開始，每個玩家選數字最高對抗，紅骰點數兩倍，解決1顆=1點影響力。)
E.行動選擇
a.執行行動卡(必須要先派人到分數格，有人可以直接執行)，放人就必須要執行卡片行動。
b.建設教堂，每排最後沒有建設的人要扣分，放置必須從低階開始
c.對抗事件(最多方塊得到較大分數，平手平分總和向下取整，放置最多方塊拿取事件卡，平手則先放方塊者先拿。)
d.放置市民到建築物，可以擠掉別人市民，被擠掉的人會平躺在建築物，若該建築物有該色市民可免於被擠，市民若移走去執行其他行動就失效。
e.農業 黃骰領2元
f.Pass領2元，每次輪到你就領1元。若所有玩家Pass或地區沒有骰子回合結束。

擴充:
每回合可以使用一顆骰子移動城牆守衛，1點1步，可以用錢加點數，最多6點，然後可以啟動行動格，每回合每個行動格最多啟動1次。
1. 我能不能放商人到行動卡上而不啟動該卡能力？
(例： 拿點數2的骰子 去啟動"點數/3"的卡片，只為了放商人)

Ans: 不行。 必須至少啟動1次。
另外，如果該行動卡是轉換東西(影響力->錢)，必須至少轉換1次，更多轉換則是選擇性。
(例: 1影響力->6元，若你點數足夠啟動4次，可選擇只轉換2次。)
如果該行動卡不是轉換東西，則必須將完整啟動次數用盡。
目的是不讓玩家只單純為了分數而放商人。

2. 放到3棟主要建築物的人從哪裡來？ 商人的人從哪裡來？

Ans: 兩個問題的答案是一樣的，你可以從個人供應區拿人(可能必須花2點影響力買人)，
或是從場上任一個位置拿人(已存在的商人、在主要建築物的人、被推出倒在一旁的人)。
若你是從場上拿人，則該位置會維持空著，直到有人執行行動將它佔滿。

3. 能不能從一張卡拿回商人，再花錢擺回同一張卡當商人？

Ans: 可以。有可能原本的商人是沒有分數的(非前兩位進去的玩家)，之後有一個玩家
將1個商人拉走去其他位置，此時格子空出來了，你可以先拿回這個沒有分數的商人，
再花錢踩進有分數的那個格子，當然同問題1，你必須至少啟動1次卡片。

4. 從主要建築物被推出來倒在一旁，可以保護不再被推，此效用持續到該回合結束嗎？

Ans: 不是。只有當你被推出的人，確實倒在那個建築物裡的時候，你得到保護。
當你將該位被推出的人拿去其他地方工作時，就不再獲得保護，該回合還是可能被推推。
規則上來說，你甚至可以拿起被推出的人，再把同一建築物裡自己的人給推出去。

5. 當我要使用行動卡上面的小方塊時(延時效應的方塊)，行動卡上必須有商人嗎？

Ans: 不用。當要啟動該卡時必須有商人，才能產生小方塊，一旦這些方塊在卡片上，
之後即使移走了該商人，還是可以使用那些小方塊。

6. 非軍事事件(黃卡及白卡)多久會發生？
Ans: 在被解決掉(該事件卡被拿走)之前，每一回合的事件階段都會發生。

7. 事件無法成功解決時的扣2分，什麼情況會發生？
   (即為原po的問題)

Ans: 事件分為3大類： (1)黑骰 (2)個別影響每位玩家 (-2影響力/-3元)
     (3)改變板子上的狀態 (中立玩家移入主要建築物/中立玩家蓋大教堂)
只有第(2)類的事件，會產生扣2分的懲罰。
例: 有一位玩家只剩1點影響力，此時事件階段每位玩家要扣2影響力，則該玩家先扣1點
影響力，然後再扣2分。第(3)類的事件絕不會發生扣2分的狀況，即使事件所需的灰色方塊
數量不足，也不會有人被扣分。第(1)類黑骰，就是在每位玩家輪流抵抗黑骰時，當有玩家
無法成功抵禦時，該玩家會被扣分，這是在所有事件效果已被解決了之後。

8.可以浪費白骰子去建造教堂,但是如果教堂都已經占滿了,則不可以使用白骰.

上面的1(至少必須啟動1次)跟6(事件每回合發生)，是最常見被忽略的地方
最後，自己再補1個，關於pass拿錢的
輪到你時，場上有任何骰子 (不論自己特區還有沒有骰子)
你可以
(1) 用骰子作行動  或著
(2) pass。這時pass會在你的特區放2元，這回合之後每次輪到你，再補1元上去。
回合會在 (a)場上完全沒骰子 或 (b)所有玩家pass 時結束
如果是以(b)的條件結束回合，每個玩家的特區上都會有錢才是正確的情況。

Troyes is sort of a dice rolling/ almost worker placement game, and it does create some tension, since dice can be purchased by another player, meaning that any move that is available is available to whichever player is on turn.  This prevents dice screwage but does make it suck to go last (although there is a balance for that).  I think the jury is still out on this one, really. (1 play)

En teoría las mecánicas "dados sin suerte" + "objetivos ocultos" + "colocación de trabajadores" + "gestión de recursos" funciona bien. En la práctica es un juego muy "marciano". Con tres tipos de recursos (dinero, influencia y PV's) que se interrelacionan de manera intrincada y con valores de equivalencia distintos en cada partida en función de las cartas de acciones, la cosa se complica innecesariamente. Hay demasiadas "mates" dónde (literalmente), cada movimiento que haces tiene un coste distinto, expresado en unidades distintas que dificulta comprararlos. PROS: mecánica innovadora lo de "dados sin suerte", gran rejugabilidad. CONS: 4º jugador en desventaja, muy pesado para ser sólo de dados (letanía eterna de sumas multiplicaciones y divisiones), sin sensación de crecimiento. Sin trama.

[ENG]

The game mechanisms of "dice without luck" + "hidden goals" + "workers placement" + "resource management" work quite good in theory. But in practical sense is a weird game. It has three kinds of resources (money, influence and VP´s) and all of them are interrelated in a complex way with different equivalences between them depending on the cards. It´s unnecessary knotty. There are a lot of maths. Every movement you do has a different cost expressed in different measures, so it´s difficult to compare two movements. PROs: innovative game mechanism (dice without luck), replayability. CONs: 4th player is on disadvantage. Lot of maths (additions, multiplications and divitions) this makes him heavier than it should. There´s no plot an no "developing feeling".

The straight-up textbook Euro counterpart to Alien Frontier's more Ameritrash leanings, I enjoy both but for different reasons.  Troyes packs in a lot of thinkiness into a reasonably short playtime, and I'm a big fan of buying other people's workers out from under them.  It does seem like the game is an Agricola-esque race to find the best synergies between the Activity cards (and hopefully your secret scoring card), so my main worry is that there is really less here than meets the eye and given the fairly small amount of Activity cards that there will be certain combinations that are just inherently better.  My other main worry is that one of players in our group was completely lost during the whole game, but still finished within a few points of the next closest player.  Still, I look forward to playing a few more times to see if it holds up.

2-4 players. Dice placement. A bit of area control. Video 24440 shows unexciting gameplay. Rahdo said Troyes was his 4th favorite game, but his run-through had a lot of goofs and he had to refer to the rulebook multiple times, which indicates high complexity.

Elegance of play is quite nice. Some people find it too long, but I find it just long enough. I think some of the expansions from Les Dames de Troyes could be left out to make the game quicker...)

I don't feel like the rulebook adequately prepares you to play this game. Also, once you do figure it out, it suffers from the same crap that so many other Euros do: symbols ALL OVER the freaking board that turn into a big eyeball salad of doom and relative discomfort.

I'd play it again another time or two to see if I hate it or not, but I suspect it wouldn't bump my rating up overly much.

First impressions: Played with two players and it was quite fun. At two players, we could, for the most part, do what we wanted to do with our dice. However, I can see the interaction ramping up with 3 and 4 players, making it a lot tighter. Overall, looking forward to playing it again.

Troyes is a great game that plays in a short time.  The game board artwork is different and pleasant and adds impact to the Medieval French city theme.  Dice are rolled by all the players at the beginning of each round and they are allocated to select actions or buy cards.  The wildest part of this game is that players have the option of using the dice rolled by other players by paying gold for them.  There are mechanisms to change the value of very undesirable dice results.  The game offers rich strategy game play and lots of meaningful decisions for players to make on their turn.  This is not an easy game to teach or learn because it is a relatively remote departure from most other games.  It's not easy to really understand what's happening in the game the first play or two.  I would say it's a heavy-medium weight game; not recommended for non-gamers.

RATING: 8
Interesting points gathering mechanism/worker placement/dice allocation.  Has expansion, but is too expensive for what you get.  Good game, plays well.  Does tend to run a bit long but remains interesting and very close scoring right to the end.  Much better form of dice worker mechanic than Alien Frontiers as Troyes allows you to manipulate the dice, reroll, and spend them in many diverse ways (as well as buying and using other players dice).

Only one play so far and that was cut just a bit short.  For two player it looks very promising.  I think there would be enough variety in the cards and goals from game to game.  And the secret goals give just enough strategy to get you going at the beginning (I think...).

It is a bit opaque to get going, but was smooth once a round was over.

Medium complexity in set up and game play. Beautiful art and nice quality to the game parts. Great theme and imaginative use of dice and cards together. High recommendation. I first played at BGG Con 2011, and liked it enough to buy it. Have played a few times now as a two player, and it climbs a little higher up my list every time. Not many games play well for both 2 players and more, this one is just that good.

Really wanted to like this game, but ended up disappointed with it. The mechanic whereby other players can forcibly buy your dice of you is frustrating, especially in setups where money is less useful. I also didn't like how the number of chance things make it primarily a game of maximizing tactical decisions. (7.2)

Edit: Upping its rating as of a second play. Still not a huge fan, but my initial thoughts were a bit harsh. (7.8)

Edit again: Five plays now, and I'm seeing the merits of Troyes a lot more. Think this was a case of having high initial expectations and then finding out it was very different than what I had expected. This is actually a great tactical decision making game. (8.4)

[b]2 Player review with expansion:[/b]

Having played the game with the expansion from the first try, I thought I'd review them together. 

The game is flawless in everything I've seen and played. The theme is spot on, the interaction is tense and exciting without making me want to curse, and the fantastic combos that present themselves systematically over every match are very clever, always original, and fun to figure out. 

There is just nothing that takes away from this game except for the very slight influence of luck. But with numerous ways to mitigate rolls thanks to the influence track, as well as the fact you can just buy dice directly from each other, the element of luck only adds to the tension and excitement of the game-play. 

Sometimes the fortification bonuses from the expansion seem a little overpowered depending on what is available, but they are always available to everyone. It just seems to force your hand slightly, to invest early in the fortifications, so that you don't miss out. 

Overall, I can't recommend this game highly enough and I can;t wait to see the countless combinations of activity cards that will present themselves over the countless plays I will enjoy over the coming years. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The activity cards are surprisingly thematic and clever in their use of the theme. 
- Rolling dice has never been so fun (for me).
- It's always exciting to see what activity cards will appear each year, how you can combine them, and what pips you will roll to strategize. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- 2 player feels very tactical, while 3 players makes it a little more random. 
- The expansion fortifications bonuses force you into an early strategy sometimes.

This is definitely the best new game I've played this year. I especially appreciate how it feels a little different in terms of the dice as workers of varying value for placement.

I enjoy the heck out of this game but have a hard time getting it to the table.

After 2 plays with Tina, I'm not a big fan of this game.  The game is pure mechanics with very little theme shining through.  Don't see it fitting with any of my playing groups.

Sold locally through craigslist after a few plays to streamline collection.

Played a few games online with 3 players, and I like the game even less.  Too much randomness for a game attempting to be medium weight.

I could be convinced to play this game if all of the activity cards are revealed at the start of the game to enable strategic play,. 

I owned this game for a while and played it several times, and whether I won(probably didn't happen) or lost(definitely happened, a lot), it never felt satisfying. My lack of trophy didn't help its case, but the game just never clicked with me or the Derpette.

:thumbsup: refreshingly stylized illustrations and graphic design
:thumbsup: ability to purchase dice your opponents control to mitigate variance and interact
:thumbsup: activity cards alone create 19,683 outset variables, and when combined with the event and character cards, every game will feel different but familiar, making the learning curve a gentle climb after the initial hike through the fog of the first game
:thumbsdown: emphasizes tactical play at the expense of strategy, and that inability to form long a term plan slows the game while players evaluate the best course of action each turn.

Played this one several times in a short timespan, and it's already starting to lose some of its luster. Don't get me wrong...it's an innovative system that I still want to play with, and there are some great elements in here. But the gameplay is very tactical...the in-game reveals of the profession cards and events adds a hefty amount of luck to the mix that can't easily be rectified without rebalancing the number of rounds in the game and/or the turn order rules.

The semi-cooperative events are appealing, but I think Sylla's implementation offers much more interesting decisions.

The fact that someone's strongest play is often to burn some dice at zero benefit to them, simply to prevent someone else from using the dice, is thematic and appropriate but ultimately unsatisfying.

A very good almost themeless euro game that should be doable in 90 minutes or so.  Plays very good with 2, 3 might be best but will scale well.  

A little luck, some can be mitigated some not. I found seeing my options hard to discern but imagine with more play this would disappear. You do have to play to your dice somewhat but you have options, buying others dice can be VERY expensive, not sure if this is even viable yet.  

Nice competition on the board and the good ole want to do everything but cant angst is there. Nice multiple ways to score also which keeps play interesting and varied.

Really fun dice game, I like that the available actions are randomized every game and that they mostly all seem interesting and strong. And the dice luck is pretty minimal since you don't really own any dice until you use them, you can use any dice you just have to pay for them if they aren't the ones you rolled, and the cost isn't too bad unless you want to use a lot of other dice at once. My biggest problem with the game is similar to that of suburbia, the secret goal cards. I don't like secret goal cards in general, but I especially don't like ones that are affected by what everyone does, since there becomes this minigame of don't give away your cards (and here some of which seem easier than others to hide). But otherwise this is an interesting game of finding the right combo of actions that come out in a given game and position yourself to best use those actions in combination. Each action must be bought into before it can be used and is only usable by at most two people so choosing the right ones to back your strategy and getting to them first is important.

UPDATE: I just played it with four and it seemed less good. I still didn't like the secret goal cards much but it would be easy enough to just have them all on display from the beginning. But with four players we each had very few dice (since the same total number are used independent of player count) and the cards got filled up quickly and I was able to win just hammering the level one red card over and over and making sure I kept at least two guys in the red building every turn, which isn't that exciting. When there are fewer players each one has more dice and thus can get more done, so there's more of the chaining of card abilities together to do interesting stuff, rather than just hammering the same one thing over and over. But I still enjoyed the play in spite of this, and I'm not changing my rating; I'll just be hesitant to play with four in the future.

The game has some interesting mechanics in acquiring powers from the available cards and using dice to perform actions depending on the dice roll (plus buying other player's dice from them to supliment your own if you choose). Unfortunately while the mechanics are interesting, they don't come together in a balanced (enough) manner. 

A key part of the game is choosing which card(s) to place your meeple on in order to be able to exploit that cards ability for the rest of the game, some cards can work together to create powerful combo's, some combo's are (a lot) more powerful than others. Missing out on a combo can be crippling.

The black dice can at times unevenly affect players, some may get away with spending hardly anything, while another player might have to spend 2 or more dice to combat them. 

The end game goal cards while giving you something to aim for, since all players score points from each others hidden goal cards, it comes down to a bit of luck as to whether you guessed what others players goals were.

Otherwise it's a solid enough game.

RATING: 6
This is a worker placement Euro where your workers are different colored dice that your roll each turn and then can place.  While the dice rolling introduces luck, it is reasonably well buffered.  The dice can be placed on special cards for useful effects, on a defense card to get points by helping fight off invaders, and in town to get more dice (I think it was, getting a little fuzzy).  I really wanted to like this one but the theme is very shallow so rather abstract and there didn't seem to be a lot of strategy.  It's mostly a very tactical game where you are maximizing payoff each turn without worrying too much about future moves, as far as I could tell.  I didn't not enjoy myself but it didn't leave me with any special desire to play again.

Game of 2010 for me! 
Incredible idea. 

I hate dices, really. But I do not feel any luck in Troyes. You can use your influence to change your dices, you can buy them to other players, place some little value lots on the athedral or on the different houses.

It is deep and you always have a lot of possibilities. What I love it that you can always come back in the game, even if your first moves were "bad".

You easily think "I am making a cool combo" and it is a pleasure to feel that.

The only negative point is that it is too short :-p
I would like to play it longer and longer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's got a steep learning curve, but once you pass that you have a very deep strategy game. Multiple victory paths, points to influence the dices means that you can overturn the luck factor and the ability to buy other player's dices adds interaction between players. 

Update: After half a dozen play, I am dropping the rating a little. With just a few rounds in a game, you will make use of just a very few activity cards in a game and I'm finding myself doing the same action a little too often. 

Update 2: The fun factor dropped significantly after 10-12 plays. Despite the different activity cards, they all feel more or less the same and you relalize after a while that there isn't many viable victory paths...

Initial Rating : 7.5 (April 2012)

Best dice game I have played, light-years better than Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers. Surprisingly Troyes has a very low luck factor due to the dice themselves as you can buy them from your opponents, the event and activity cards add to the randomness but in this case I like it very much.

The playtime is generally short, you have lots of interesting decisions and, as the activity cards change from game to game, it has great replayability.

The dice mechanic is brilliant and it is the first time it really excites me to play with dice in an strategy game :D.

Perhaps its greatest weakness is that it seems the game gives an unfair advantage to the first and second player as they are always assured to begin 2 rounds. I´m not sure about that but I plan to play many more times to review this point.

For now I love the game and I can´t wait to play it again.

I still like Troyes a lot, however now I don’t want to play it as often as before, so I’m downgrading its rating to 7.5. This way it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation rating system. I think Troyes is a good game that I’m usually willing to play.

The game that fired Kingsburg.  Troyes sets a new standard for weight in a dice game; I hadn’t thought a medium-heavy dice game was possible but it seems to work very well here.  There’s some luck in what die values are rolled but randomness seems to have a much lower  effect on the game than player skill.
  
The iconography is a bit confusing on a first play; I actually had an easier time learning Race for the Galaxy when it first came out, then I did Troyes.  I am especially bad at deciphering icons however.

I need to play more to decide how much I like this game but it’s definitely a good one and a game I’ll consider buying.

Second play update - I'm concerned about turn order.  Not for balance reasons; I think the military obligations balance out any turn order advantage.  But it's harder to make big moves as a late player in the turn order, and I'm worried that might make the game less fun for players 3 and 4.

Update: upon reflection, while how the dice are used is a creative touch, it's just another Euro efficiency engine / points optimiser. And I'm done with them by and large.
................
Only one solo (to get my head round it) and one ftf, it seems an intriguing game of many choices and trade offs. There are a few standard Euro nechanisms in here but there's original stuff too. In particular I like dice and I like the unique use of them here.

More and more I find myself liking French games, not as dry and efficiency-based as German games (I get paid to do stuff like that at work...) nor as long and anal as some of the American ones. Salut!

I continue to be pleased with this game.  I feel like I have not really scratched the surface with the depth of strategy in the game.  The deduction element to the end-game scoring is a simple twist that I think adds a lot to the game.  I like dice, but often find myself frustrated by luck in my games.  This addresses that very peculiar issue well with all of the luck mitigation features.

Picked up the expansion and have also played it more, recently. Those combined up my ranking to a 10. With 6 cards per card location (9 total) there are over 10 million possible combinations all but guaranteeing every game you play is unique.

The dice worker implementation is unique, fresh and well designed. The fact that you don't own the dice you roll gives the game tension and a lot of interaction.

Typical of a lot of euro games, you never have enough actions for everything you want to, which is a good thing! Can't get enough of this game.

There's a reprint coming, and so I highly recommend getting this game.

This is a semi cooperative deduction game!
I love love love that everybody gets an end of game scoring condition and although they alone get to see it, everyone will score from it. That's the deduction part, watching how everybody plays to try to figure out what end game scoring they have. 
The game itself was a little hard to learn and the art put my wife off from wanting to play it. But half a game in and you begin to pick the game up. It's well worth getting through that first game though, especially as at the end of the game you will want to play it again right away and think you will know how to play better!
It is a puzzley game (I love that) and although it may appear lucky given the dice role, it's more about optimizing. Very similar to castles of burgundy that way. This is a great game and will be in my collection for a long long time.

A really nice randomness mechanic, and a 3-4 player game with very serious competition but not a lot of nastiness

Pros:
- The randomness (card as well as dice) is a bit lucky, but mostly just adds replay.
- Fairly pretty.

Cons:
- Only play really well with THREE players! Four players takes too long...
- Fairly complicated, and really must be explained completely in order to be fair. Lots of little edge cases.

This is such a great dice rolling, kinda worker placement game. It really defies clear mechanical distinction. It plays like no other game I've played. Such interesting decisions, it's a bit thinky, but not quite a brain burner. It's great with 2 and plays pretty fast.

I like some aspects of what Troyes offers, but it isn't what I'm looking for in a game. The use of dice is inventive, but the other elements of the game feel disjointed. The artwork is poor in my opinion, and the theme is dry and uninspiring. This isn't a bad game, but it just isn't fun to me.

Balanced euro mechanics, lots of different paths to victory, many strategies to try, good player interaction, good amount of randomness, variation between plays, in a short play time.

What's not to like about this game? I don't know. It has a unique dice mechanic with a good way (influence) to migrate bad rolls. The buying of each others dice and positioning of meeples in buildings and cards provides lots of interaction. Lots of tactical choices to be made. Speculation on the hidden role for victory points in end game. Tons of re-playability. The art is debatable - for me it's a thumbs down.

It's an imaginatively conceived game, well designed.  It suffers from some degree of chaos.

Players are gradually confronted with a growing list of special powers that they can buy and use.  Each one "does stuff" with one of the three colors of dice.  Some get points, some money, some change the pips on other dice (thereby creating synergies.)

Players earn certain quantities of dice, in those three colors, by placing workers there.  Roll your dice, and in turn, apply them to your powers, or buy new ones.

The good and bad part of this is that a poor roll isn't the end of the world - you can buy other people's dice.  But they can buy yours, sometimes really making it difficult to execute a plan.

I don't win this game, so clearly I don't fully get the right way to play it.  It's a design I respect, even though it often infuriates me.

Troyes was the dark horse of Spiel 2010 gamers' games like Vasco da Gama in the year before. While everybody expected 7 Wonders and London to be hits, this soared above the other releases out of the blue. But as with Vasco, it's not so special for me. It's decent, I like to play it again but it is by no means the next big thing.
Its differentiating feature is the unique use of dice. You roll a lot of dice but it doesn't matter much if rolls are low or not as you can buy high rolls from other players and even for low dice rolls there's often something that can be done with them. In this field Troyes scores against other dice-rollers like Kingsburg, Yspahan or Airships. Troyes is another proof of gamers fondness for complexity. The upfront rules investment is heavy and during the first one or two games players will repeatedly have to look up the meaning of all the little symbols. Troyes has yet to prove if the complexity ends up providing a deep game or just an illusion of possibilities. Compared with other dice-rollers, it loses the lightness that makes these games enjoyable. To sum up my impression, Troyes is a dice game for gamers that don't like to roll dice. While a paradox at first sight, this seems to be a fair description of the BGG crowd. It's also the first game by Xavier Georges I rather enjoyed (at least finally as my first reaction was more of the 'what the heck' type). With Royal Palace and especially Carson City, he created two of my least liked worker placement games before.
While initially deterred by the artwork depicted online, I enjoyed it in actual gameplay where it doesn't look so drab.

While the theme in Troyes is an absolute bore - bland city influence like every other game - it benefits greatly from nice artwork (finally some euro artwork I can get behind) that feels evocative and seemingly new mechanisms.

While there is nothing really new in the dice - you could find traces of Yspahan, Kingsburg or Stone Age in here, it's hard to explain what makes this feel so much different.  Obviously rolling well is helpful, but the ability to buy other players' dice is important as well.

I think what impresses me about this game is the way that it feels very much unlike most other games out there.  I think it's that (at least at this point in my limited experience) the best way to earn points is not immediately apparent.  It feels a little bit like a chore in figuring out what the best engine will be.  That's probably due in large respect to the randomness of the cards that come out, but I think that creates an uncertainty that feels fairly unique.

Essen Copy. Interesting dice game, but a bit on the complicated side. (Updates to follow)

[Update]
This is a brain-burner. Because your decision tree is made by picking combinations of dice, there's no real way to make any long term plans. You strategize based on what dice rolls are on the board.

Its definitely enjoyable if you like puzzles. But I think for most non-gamers, this game would be too complicated to be worth teaching to.

I am very much intrigued by the game, by the mechanics, and this will keep me interested, engaged and wanting to play it more times. I was surprised how weak the theme is, we felt that out of all the games we have played this is the game where the theme is the weakest. However, the interesting gameplay and the miriads of choices will make up for that.
We were overwhelmed in the first two turns as to what we can and should do, but towards the end of the game the pieces kind of came together.
After coming home I read the rules again, and I feel we could teach it to friends or to the kids, but Troyes is a kind of game that is hard to teach well, and it helps if you know the action cards well when teaching the game.
I expect the game is even more interesting and interactive with more players, as it is usual the case with such games.

I have only ever played Troyes 2 player and am dying to try it out with more. I love the style and art of this game, I think it is beautiful. I love the way dice are implemented. It is kind of hard to "get"this game just by reading the rules, but after a play or to it starts to click and all of your options start to come to light. It is awesome when you can hit a really powerful card combination to earn a bunch of money or VP's. One of the games in my collection I wish I could get to the table more.

The gameplay is simple, yet deep, just cutthroat enough. Plus, with 2, it plays in under an hour. Not once have I played this game without thinking I'd play another one.

2015-12-19 - 8 - Very good medium-heavy euro game with dice manipulation and unique artwork. The theme is rather thin but consistent. I'm quite surprised that there is quite strong random factor in such a heavy game, which at the same time is widely acclaimed by the euro-gamers. By any means it's not a bad thing for me. Probably even bad rolls are more controllable than I can imagine after the very first game. For a euro there is quite a lot of negative interaction which might not suit everyone.

2017-10-06 - 8->7 - Random set of action cards provides this game a decent replayability, but unfortunately it can also lead to quite boring sets of cards, which makes the particular play less interesting.

I've played Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers, but Troyes beats those games hands down. I don't understand why this one is so much fun, given all the dice rolling and random bad things that dominate the game. Maybe it's the fact that in the midst of all that randomness you have an intense resource management thing going on, for the sole purpose of supporting the worker placement part of the game. And it all comes together beautifully to create a game that is amazingly addictive and fun. Another thing I love about Troyes is the graphic design of the game... except for the title font on the cards, which is often difficult to read. But that is a minor quibble. Troyes is simply excellent!

OK game with a clever use of dice but in the end yet another worker placement game where you collect money and influence to turn these via the dice and cards into victory points. The trick is to find the super combinations, but somehow I am not that interested to explore the tricks for this game.

RATING: 8
Troyes is simpler than one would expect after the lengthy rules, but in a good way. Game moves forward with quick enough pace and there is plenty of turn angst and almost enough interaction. A lot of new games use dice in some new, clever way but Troyes may be the cleverest of the bunch. 

Small minus because of the card symbols, which aren't as logical and clear as they should be. Only a few cards are used in each game and they are visible to everybody, so it isn't a big problem to check them from the rules though.

Since Kingsburg dissappointed me. Roll through the ages was a clear miss. I didn't expect toomuch of it.
Probably the biggest surprise of the weekend (other first timers included hotel life , dominant species , struggle of empires, Taj Mahal , Amon Re, American rails)for me.
The game was teached incredibly well giving me all the info I needed by the end of round two to squeeze out a win in round 6. Scoring extremely well in bonuses

Biggest surprise game of 2010

RATING: 7.4
Lots of thinking must have been put into the designing of this game. The way it uses dice is quite unique. Many aspects of the game actually make thematic sense. Several activity cards are really ingenious. Some say it is fiddly, but I guess it is manageable. One thing I'm wondering is whether there is a significant advantage to the first player (despite his obligation to counter the black die with the highest value first).

Fairly nice game, taking into account it has dice. Lots of dice. Luckily it doesn't really matter what you happen to roll, since you can just buy your dice, and rerolling / otherwise modifying your rolls is fairly easy. Basic worker-placement, where you have workers to produce the dice and actions, and dice to pay for the actions you take. Nice mechanic, would like to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
"Dice placement" that at times feels like a puzzle of finding the best scoring combos and the optimal timing to execute them, with a bit of interaction and a cool bluffing aspect. It doesn't cease to amaze how much fun Troyes can be, because it basically is just a money/influence/VP conversion spreadsheet. So much better than any Feld game ever. Very high replayability. Works with all player counts, with 2 can be tough if the events pile up to ruin both players plans, so introductory games for new players should probably be played with 3 or 4.

Interesting game. Some new twist included which is nice surprise and there is some unique use of dice too. Symbols could be a bit more clear (luckily this isn't same kind of disaster than Tournay) and it wouldn't be bad, if you could teach and play it a bit quicker. But yes, definitely game which I'm ready to play every now and then + I think Troyes is one of the best Essen 2010 releases.

In Troyes, recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France. Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city: religious, military, and civil. Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them—anything for more fame!

Great visual appeal and wonderful use of action dice.  I particularly like the dice manipulation mechanisms in this game, as well as the ability to purchase your opponents' dice.  One of my favorite Euro designs.  It has all of the elements that make Euros interesting to me: hidden information, unknown future events that can radically alter the game state, and a high degree of player interaction.  Of course, most Eurogames lack these elements, as many fans of the genre prefer games with more perfect information and predictability.

"I used to think I hated dice, then I played Troyes. I was blown away by how much more dice can be than just an RNG. It's like an elegant poker game with all the players wearing full body medieval garments. The secret goals are literally the best in any game ever, and the tradesmen cards offer virtually infinite replayability and a different feel to each game. The ability to purchase other players dice results in a tense tactical game, with the long term strategy of secret goals offering intrigue and cohesion." - said better than I by BGG User josefsalien

Visual style is so unique! some dislike it, but I love it. Mechanics are very clever and novel and it works well with any number of players (rare to see). Events and professions that come up change the game a lot. Not every match is super exciting, but there's conflict and satisfying decisions.

RATING: 6
Played once, 4 players.  Dice.  But not as annoying as Kingsburg, in that, low numbers in Troyes can actually be used.  The rulebook was unclear in certain areas though, and could use another editing pass.  The game might last a bit too long, as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's been a while since a game of this caliber came out.  Troyes uses a dice mechanics reminiscent of Kingsburg combined with simple worker placement and variable actions with high interactions, possible combinations and potential synergy.  The result is a fairly deep game with nice strategy, decent player interaction but no attrition and a very limited but valuable random component.  Can take a game to get into for neophytes but was pretty much instant for me.  The variable actions pretty much guarantee that you will need to play *a lot* before this ever feels remotely repetitive.  This will hit the table.

Troyes is full of beautiful gaming goodness. Variable card set up make replayability limitless. You get to roll some dice and place your workers according to your dice rolls. You can even use another players dice for your benefit. I wish all games were this amazing!!! The delicious agony of making all those tough decisions put this game in my top 25 all time !!

RATING: 9
LIKE:

* Innovative dice mechanic - each player rolls dice according to which region/color they have influence.  However, players are able to buy dice from other players meaning that you may not be able to use the dice that you roll! 
* Action cards bring a ton of variety and replayability to the game as you only use 9 each game and there are 25 available.  Each one allows players who place an influence on the card to use dice in creative ways.
* Each player receives a secret VP requirement for the end game that one should seek to deduce what other players may have.
* First player must always combat the invaders and black dice using their own personal dice.  Assuming the first player only takes out one black die and others are present, each player in turn must defeat at least one black die using their own dice until none remain.
* Cards often provide interesting combos that work well together.
* Although I know some people hate this aspect of the game, I find the fact that you can buy dice from your opponents a very interesting part of this game.  You may think you own the dice, but you may not end up being able to use them if other players buy them out from under you!

DISLIKES:

* The math for buying dice can be confusing initially as the price for each die you buy is based on whether you end up with 1,2 or 3 dice. 
* The game relies on players working together to keep opponents in check.  One person refusing to do this will at times lead to runaway winners by whomever gets the best combo going first.  While I don't mind this in a game if people are aware of this and play accordingly, playing this when people know this and refuse to do anything about it is very aggravating.
*  Turn order is an issue, particularly in a four player game.  If I play with three, we usually play 6 rounds so everyone is start player twice.  However, playing with four is more difficult - I've thought about trying to either go 8 rounds (not sure I want to add another hour to the game) or just going four rounds (not enough time to really get your card combos going.  In short, this seems to be perfect for three and going 6 rounds and less so for other player counts.

Dropped rating from 9 -> 8 after a couple plays where one person ran away with the victory both times because everyone stood around and let him and then blamed the game.  I'm not sure this game is going to get a fair shake around here.

I admit, I kind of went into this one expecting not to be that crazy about it. A rules explanation with a bunch of "you can do this unless" or "this happens except when" didn't make me feel any better. However, I was surprised to find that I kind of liked this one. I wasn't bowled away by it or anything, but it's a game where you build a goddamn cathedral that I wouldn't get a little queasy if it was proposed. I like the way it handles dice and allows for one to try different angles. Not stunningly inventive, but also not as dry and uninspired as it appears to be at first.

For a game with piles of dice, random events, and random action spaces there is sure a ton of control in this game.

The key is that no player is ever locked out of being able to use a given action space. There's even the ability to "flip" dice to their opposite face, reroll dice, or action spaces to convert the color of dice.

In all quite a fine game that I hope to own some day.

RATING: 10
Who would have thought that a game which relies so heavily on dice could have so many interesting decisions?  This is a "dice-placement" worker-placement game which obsoletes Kingsburg.  There is not only a lot more going on, but so much more re-playability.  A very in-your-face euro-game with an unusually high amount of interaction.  Not dependent on rolling dice well, because of the myriad of ways that one can spend influence to modify pips, or spend money to buy an opponents dice.  Brilliantly done.

The artwork on the cards and board are timeless, reminiscent of orthodox Russian icons. The symbols used on the cards take a little bit of study to understand, but less nebulous than "Race for the Galaxy" symbology (which I also enjoy).

There are a lot of little, but important, rules in this game.  Some of which seem a bit fiddly.  Small subtle ones that are easily missed, but make a big difference.  I've decided that the game is not in fact fiddly, as in Agricola-fiddly.  But I do recommend playing your first game with an experienced player who can assist in this regard.  Our 4-player games take a while (2-2.5hrs) because we make sure that the activity cards are thoroughly understood by all before moving forward with a turn, and we don't play Troyes often enough to memorize these.  TTFN.

Way too mathy.  The dividing total pips by numbers is way to much for what this game is.  Also the "Bonus" cards were not included in the base game because they break the base game.  The red event card just breaks the games event track.  Nobody wants to place cubes on a card that will be lost the next round so either take out a card or don't bother.  Won't play with it again.  Just not feeling all the dividing dice in this one.  Very similar games out there without that.

An interesting game where you roll dice and other players can buy your dice to take actions building a cathedral, placing workers on buildings, attacking invaders, or getting money.  

I can see where the a criticism of the game is that it is thematically dry and the artwork is done in a medieval style and is uninspiring.  However the game mechanics are so good that it makes up for these shortcomings.  

It is an excellent game if you like medium-weight Euros.

Feld-ish Euro with nothing much that really stands out from the pack.  The mechanics of dice placement and manipulation are not intuitive to me.  Something about the hidden scoring and action cards kind of bugs me.  I'll need to play more to solidify my rating.  Learning the cards or the expansions might improve the fun factor.  I like the art work more than most.

This title offers an interesting use of dice. It's kind of frustrating though that your dice can be taken from you even if you do get paid for them.

Rating after three plays. I thought the first two games were OK. The last game was a bit of a horror. There is a lot of dry counting and not enough fun. Also too much scope to be frustrated by luck and having your dice bought from under you, and possibly a serious problem with the imbalance created by turn order which IMO is not nearly made up for by the balancing mechanics. I could see my position was hopeless by the mid-game stage, and had to endure another hour of tortured, snowballing gameplay to see this confirmed.

A terribly written rulebook meant that I made several abortive attempts to learn the rules before I finally got this game to the table. Here's a big tip for rulebook writers: start with a quick rundown of the basic shape of the game before going into details, never introduce new terminology without first explaining it, and when there are cards that do more than one thing, include a diagram labeling the different features of the card.

Rant aside, this is a cool game. The available actions vary from game to game, which promises plenty of variety in terms of strategies used. In theory, this should mean we don't get to see the same one or two strategies used every game (which is a huge flaw in lesser games such as Kingsburg), but only time will tell.

I like the artwork in this game quite a bit, although the fine detail in the line drawings can distract from the iconography on the game-related features of the board. This is a minor problem with form over function, but shouldn't be a problem in a well-lit room.

Innovative game, with a lot more weight and depth than the rules would suggest.  Don't be deceived by the dice rolling, the game provides ample opportunities to override the element of luck and replace it with tactical decisions.  Very interactive, good playlength, definitely a meaty game that deserves repeated plays.  It gives only the illusion of a lower barrier to entry than similarly weighty games, I have now noticed many times that it takes time for new players to start grokking what happens in game due to its originality and weight.  A nice addition to broaden game choices when you have 90-120 minutes gap and a desire for something heavy that does not require a heavy rules explanation or refreshing the rules every time.  Great components and presentation.  Another good game by Pearl games.

Preliminary rating.
I need more plays of his one. Maybe the rating goes up I do not know yet.
Innovative usage of dice. Otherwise is still the game of building VP machine with twists.
The twists however are very interesting and if they prove to be the game would go up.

RATING: 6
Rating after one play. Interesting game, you're trying to find the most lucrative route from dice results to VP based on the available activity cards. Still very opaque and not very exciting (the graphic presentation of the game doesn't help here, it's a style I dislike).
After a couple of plays: rating downgraded to 6, it's a good game but it just doesn't excite me at all.

RATING: 8
A very appealing mixture of strategy, tactics and reading your opponents, with a bit of luck thrown in for good measure - enough luck to blame your defeats on cursed dice, but certainly not enough to wash out the other aspects. It’s quite astonishing that such a dizzying heap of mechanisms and action cards and different currencies manages to play quite smoothly, and this might be Troyes biggest accomplishment.

There was a distinct whiff of first player advantage in the two games I’ve played so far, however: in both cases someone with two start player rounds won. I really feel that the game would have benefited immensely from another development round purely aimed at decreasing or increasing the number of rounds in a way that each player gets the same number of start player rounds. A possible fix might be different amounts of starting money or, for experienced players, bidding off the first two positions.

Otherwise, highly recommended and even a possible buy for me.

A very nice and fun dice placement game. There's a lot of strategy going on.

The first player gets a brutal edge, though, and the players don't get to be the first player equally.

If we apply a house rule that makes the game end when everybody has played as first player twice, the game will be more balanced and, therefore, more fun.

Despite this minor flaw, I loved it and expect to play again soon.

This is one of my favourite games and has been in my top 10 games since I first got it. Lovely crunchy, thinky, tense Euro with dice! One of the best games I have with dice, or without dice, for that matter. 

In Troyes the value (pips) of the dice you have influence over represent the relative strength/influence/work of your workers (councilmen or ladies) that you have placed in different areas of city life (religion, military, civic) but unfortunately nothing in the game is safe as you can buy the dice from each other and bugger up each others plans. But the more powerful those dice become for you the more you have to pay, leading to the player you bought them from to then have a ton of money they are looking to throw about and offload on someone else as they buy their dice in turn. By one (ill conceived or magnificently planned) purchase you can create a veritable tsunami of dice movement and then before you know it the round is over and you are left with a few pips on a yellow dice that you can only trade in for agricultural work and a bit of money. Could be a post modern impression of the workings of the E.U.!

I love every single one of the myriad of mechanics in this game, they all work wonderfully well together. So far every game of it has been different and as a bonus (if you like that sort of thing) the official solo rules are ok as well.

There is nothing bad I can say about this game ... stop don't even raise the subject of the artwork! I think it is wonderful and one of the best examples of fantastic thematic artwork I own in a game ... so don't even go there.

The game is so good that despite it being one of my favourites since I first played it, I haven't even thought about getting the expansion. For me I just imagine it would add to much and end up detracting from the game. But having said that I do like the idea of the purple dice no-one can steal from you ... it would be nice to have just a little bit of security in this game! 

If you don't have this and like thinky euros and fancy adding a twist to your usual gaming cocktail, jump on the reprint as soon as it comes out this summer. I wouldn't grab the expansion straight away though I would recommend trying the base game in its full glory before you going messing around with the Ladies of Troyes!

It took me 90 minutes to teach myself Troyes, an hour to teach it to my group, and then two hours for our first play -- so this is like nothing else in my collection. It's the deepest game I own, which isn't a bad thing.

I love it.

There's a LOT going on in the game, but the iconography is brilliant, the rules are clear and logical (I only missed one, albeit an important one: the fact that characters apply to everyone), and after a few turns it starts to click. On a second play, I'm confident the same group would hit the listed 90-minute play time. (Unfortunately, 1/4 of my regular group hated it, so it's not likely to hit the table often.)

I love the artwork, the mood, the use of dice -- man is that a brilliant mechanic! -- and the sheer amount of stuff that's packed into Troyes, yet which avoids seeming overwhelming on any given turn.

There's lots of strategy, a nice amount of tactics, and relatively little downtime. I could usually plan my next turn in advance, then juggle it accordingly if someone torpedoed it.

All in all, I'm amazed at how well this comes together -- it's exactly the game I wanted it to be.

This is my favourite game simply because I enjoy it so much.  It doesn't have the complex strategy of other games, but there are so many options in this game, and there is just something about it that I find so much fun.

I really like dice, but don't enjoy games with a high element of luck. This game has the randomness of dice but very little luck; there are numerous effective ways to use whatever has been rolled, you just have to think. 

The player interaction is indirect like most euros, but it is there in abundance compared to others, and this I consider a good feature.

The game is mainly tactical, but there is strategy involved, and your long term strategy will affect you tactical decisions significantly (this might sound daft but hopefully you know what I mean!).  To play it effectively really means that you should have an overall strategy, but allow yourself to be significanly pushed and pulled but the flow of the game.  Compare this to Puerto Rico where you are pushed and pulled much more such that in reality there is little strategy at all, and something like navegador where the actions of others are unlikely to pull you off your main strategy.

There is so much going on in this game, but all in a good way, there is a tightness of not being able to do all the things you want so you have to prioritise, but not so much so that you feel restricted.

The only real problem is that others in my gaming group don't enjoy this game with the abundance that I do, though they do like it.

Played once with all Newbies.  It took a long time to get started.  There are a lot of rules that are hard to get in the beginning.  Funny thing was we agreed to quit the game early, but then it started to get fun.  The game went from flailing around, to strategizing, to very cutthroat.

I respect that it's a Euro worker placement, but still has room for player interaction being a signficant element.  Additionally the art is just beautiful and very era appropriate.

Solid game. It's a heavier version of Kingsburg. Both use dice as workers, both focus on fighting off enemies, both provide ways to mitigate bad dice rolls (although Troyes offers more choices), both use worker placement as the primary mechanic, etc. While I feel that Troyes gives you more to chew on, I like Kingsburg quite a bit more. Kingsburg is simply more dynamic. Anyone can play Kingsburg, while Troyes is a true gamer's game. That said, I really like Troyes, and it plays well with 2.

Crafted A Game of Troyes 9/21/16.

Huge amounts of replayability coming from variable Activity cards, Character cards, and Events.  Although there is some luck (it being a dice game and all), it's mitigated by influence actions and the ability to buy other dice.  Every game really feels different due to variation in Activity cards.  Some games might have amazing money actions, while others will force you to play more conservatively and focus on influence or resolving Events.  

The Game of Thrones re-theme I crafted really countered my only complaint about the game - the art.

I really like the various "bad roll" mitigations in this game - especially the way that all Player's dice are part of the available pool. Add in variable powers and multiple ways to score VPs and I think that you have a good game. One that I wish that I got to play more.

Very nice game. It is a dice placement game, but since you can buy dice from our opponents and the neutral player, it can be played very tactical and is rather interactive and has a strong timing element.
I also love the artwork, playing time and the fact, that the rules are fairly short and easy to remember.
On the downside there is little knowledge of what will be a worthwhile strategy in the first two to three rounds, since you don't know which cards/combos will be available/where it is meaningful to acquire more dice. In a 2P game which lasts four rounds, this can be annoying.
The game is fun, I am not sure if the mechanics are that strong - my feeling is no.

Initial rating based on a three-player game. I can see why people compare this to a Feld game, though it feels much less mechanical to me. I like the heavy tactical play, the variation from game to game in the activity (I/II/III) cards, and the options present for forming dice groups, manipulating their values, and placement thereof. My only knocks are that I think the hidden goals should be public and that each player should go first in an equal number of rounds.

----------

I now understand why the character cards are hidden.  There are only 6 of them, so once you've played a few times and get used to them, that added bit of deduction adds something to the game.

The game is fantastic with 2 and 3 players.  With 4, I think it is too chaotic.  Too much can happen between one turn and the next and you don't get enough dice to start with.  I suppose some might say this is made up for by the fact that there are more rounds in the game, but I don't think so.

My rating is 10 for the 2-player game (it is utter perfection), 9 for the 3-player game and 7 for the 4-player game.  I won't play with 4 any longer.

05/14/11 Played a four-player game. The box said 90 minutes. It took us 3.6 hours, which mentally exhausted us. Massive analysis paralysis. Troyes is interesting and worth playing again, though due to its length not very often. For it will fry your brain. Not so much from arithmetic calculations per se, but from having to examine a multitude of ever changing options each turn, for many hours. You may have the perfect plan to use your dice, but by the time you turn comes around one of more of them may have been bought and used by someone else. So you end up going not with plan B, but plan E or F. As to the physical components, overall they were good. Though the icons on a few cards were unfathomable.

Great use of dice in this game!

There is not much chaos, and the little bit that is there is easily manageable.  The four of us around the table got a good time playing this game.  Overall, I would have liked a bit more diversity in the cards (expansion here I am...) that you can have in the different "guilds" and in the bottom row.

Overall a good design.  Thumbs up!

Good God, this is organised chaos. If you're the type of gamer who likes to make plans, or who dislikes having other players take their stuff from them; if you dislike the randomness of dice or being screwed by people who bump you from a space just before you take a crucial action then this is not the game for you.

A game of abstract politics, players place their followers to provide civil, military or religious influence. Each follower located in one of the three influence locations gives the player a die - red for military, yellow for civil and white for religious actions. 

Roll your dice and place them in the square. When it's your turn you can use the pips of one colour to provide you with actions and benefits... the trouble is, picking which colour to use can be painful as other players can pay to use your dice. Do you take a military action this turn? If so, you may not get to take that civil action you wanted next turn because the dice may not exist any longer, having been used by an opponent.

Lots of routes to victory. There are cards which give a lot of flexibility and replayability as well as tension. The ways the systems of dice, money and influence interact are simple but clever. There are constant incursions inherent in the system which need to be controlled by the players or they'll lose money/dice/followers. Your opponents can bump your influence - in fact, they can pay to use your own die rolls against you!

An unpredictable, beautiful, glorious mess. Sheer genius.

Apart from the obvious connection, while mechanically there's absolutely nothing in common with Carson City, I constantly thinking about that when playing Troyes. Must be the tight turn limit combined the mind-blowing amount of options and the player interaction, gives the same overwhelming '[i]so little time, so much to do[/i]' feeling. I couldn't choose between them, thankfully I don't have to.

After one play I'm not sure if I'm gonna like it or not. Nifty & original mechanism, but it takes some time to see what you need to do. It feels quite indirect, and I can see why some people see it as 'too much work'.

Intriguing game though. Want to play again before I consider buying it.

I thought this would be a lot more of a engine-builder game, instead it was a tactical game of resource management and thus I liked it a lot better. You have to set yourself up to be able to make the best of any situation. Further plays will most likely reveal certain "must do's" in terms of getting gold from the get go at least, but otherwise I can't see this game falling into set strategies "I'm going for the Red dice strategy" etc. Lovely and cutthroat with wasting other players dice, grabbing spots they need, pushing them out of buildings. However, it might be a bit overwrought? A bit too much stuff thrown in there that could be cut away - I don't know, maybe it would lose something in the process, but I think it could get away with some simplification.

Ultimately themeless, but I don't care about that, and lacks a "story" - you are opportunistic all the way through, eeking out a point there and a point there, and that is fine but for a game of this "size" I'd like more of an arch / story. Still I liked this.

A good game!

This game proves there are exceptions to every rule -- it is full of mechanisms that normally turn me off. It's dice-based, it has secret scoring, even an event deck! But everything comes together in a wonderful way. This is the game for people who think of euros as Agricola-like solitaire garbage. The interaction is woven into the gameplay beautifully, not tacked on. The variety of activity cards gives the game high replayability. It's great at every player count, though 4-player games can run a bit long. The artwork fits the (albeit thin) theme and really grows on you. No game engages me like Troyes.

I can see the appeal, but I am not a big worker placement person. That said, I like the non-linearity of the constantly changing board state (people buying the dice you want) and should probably try it again. That aspect reminded me of Dominant Species (the only worker placement game I am into), so might lure me back to play again and delve deeper.

Hey, not a bad little game.  Nice dice mechanisms, seemingly lots of replayability, nice with two players.  Did not expect much but turned out better than expected.  Plays pretty fast as well.

Really enjoying this one so far! I already added the Ladies of Troyes into the game, and every game has felt completely different. A definite keeper.

It can feel a little too tight, at times. You don't really have that many options for big turns. But some of that is the cut-throat nature of the game. With a competitive group, the game is very very tough.

This game takes dice management to the next level.  The board has 6 spots each for military, religious and civil influence.  Players who have workers in these areas will get to roll dice of that color on their turn.  After each player rolls all their dice they're placed on the table and used to pay for actions but first they must fight off any enemies (black dice) and events.  This is where the fun begins.  Besides the dice themselves there are two other currencies: influence points and money.  Players can pay these to flip dice, steal dice, re-roll dice etc.  On a players turn he can try to displace others in one of the dice spots or pay for one of the many cards available - which give special powers, money, influence, etc.  You can also use dice to defeat enemies and earn victory points. 

Overall, it's a very engaging game with a lot of interaction and some meaty tactical decisions.  The dice and their values are used in a variety of ways.  One of the better games to come out in 2010.

*Dec 2012* I don't own it but have played it about 4 or 5 times on boardgamearena.com. It's an amazing, streamlined, and balanced game. A must-own for any Euro lover. I always lose badly as having a computer screen as an interface (including rule checking) makes the game much more difficult to grok and internalize. 

Definitely buying this for my go-to 90 minute Euro.

Enjoyable Euro fare of worker-placement, and Troyes kicks it up a notch with a well-integrated random dice mechanic (dice pips--and colors--become resources once rolled).  Bit of a learning curve is there to identify the relative strengths of different paths, but one play is good enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
the "souped up Kingsburg" assessment is not really fair to either game.  Troyes is your standard Euro VP accumulation game with a great dice mechanic.  The ability to acquire others dice via money is a nice take on the worker placement mechanic and creates some great dynamics.   

There are a lot of mechanics here, but it does not feel like any of them are crammed into the game (like, say, Colonia).

2 player falls far behind 3 and 4 player.

Given the current prices I'm regretting somewhat that I sold it already. Nevertheless, the game play really did not attract me much. Did not like the idea of having to constantly assure that I keep enough dice (lose them if being pushed out of buildings). Also, I have a dislike for getting only a fixed number of rounds and the dice actions seemed pretty bland to me.

"Great medieval Dice Placement game, that looks more complex than it actually is. ..The gameplay is very tight, and you never feel like you have enough actions (i.e. dice) to perform everything you need.

I absolutely adore this game! This is a dice game which uses dice for action selection. I like the high player interaction, the hidden goals for the end scoring and the cards for the worker placement part that are different every game. I love the artwork (acquired taste I guess). This is not an easy game to get into, the rules are somewhat complex and vague sometimes. That is a minor complaint, this is a winner!

Troyes es un eurogame duro dirigido a jugadores con experiencia. El manual de reglas que acompaña al juego no facilita su comprensión y aquel jugador novel que se aproxime a ellas puede sentirse aturdido. Las mecánicas, que no son en absoluto complicadas, están perfectamente engranadas, y una vez interiorizadas fluyen con naturalidad. La incorporación de dados para cuantificar la fuerza de producción de los trabajadores y minimizar el azar de los mismos es fantástica y aporta frescura al panorama lúdico.

After 5 plays, I can appreciate the design but it's not so fun for me. It's likely got more to do with how my brain is wired than with the game itself. Constant resource conversion and juggling (2 influence into 3 coins, 3 coins into 1 VP, etc). It was reminiscent of Homesteaders to me - too many similar options to juggle, and I just have a mental roadblock for this stuff. I want to like it more than I actually do.

3 years later I reacquired the game at the behest of my wife. My tastes must have changed in the last 3 years, because Troyes really works for me now. It's one of my favorites now.

Troyes is a very interesting game that doesn't quite feel like anything else I've played before. It seems like there's a good amount of replayability due to the random distribution of the cards. It seemed utterly devoid of theme, thus coming off purely as an abstract puzzler, but maybe it would have been more fun had I not been looking at the board upside down. The main downside I'd say is its length: our game probably took at least two hours, for which I generally want a little bit more of an experience. Nonetheless, I'm sure I'll be back for more someday.

Played twice.  An enjoyable game.  I like the semi-cooperative element in fighting off the attackers outside the wall.  I find it a little annoying it's so easy for people to steal your dice, but it goes both ways.  It's a little hard to plan strategy, when you are dependent on the dice rolls and on what others do.  Very tactical.  I enjoyed the artwork quite a bit too.  I'd like to play it a couple more times at least and I may end up picking this one up.

Some issues with turn order assymetry, since it is a huge advantage to go first and get first pick of dice, and there is no effort to ensure that everyone gets an equal number of turns as first player; but still, a fascinating puzzle game.

A game with 24 dice, with luck mitigated.. Lots of options and lots of variation each game.. Works awesome with 2, 3 & 4.. Has a feld feel & i love feld games.. 
Edit: Played this game a bunch more times and every game has felt a little different,forcing you to focus on different strategic routes (which is an awesome thing)
The expansion is a must have if you enjoy this game as it adds lots more interesting options to choose from.. Making this quickly one of my favourite games in my collection which is surprising as i wasn't so sure about this one at first.. The art work is probably my favourite in any game i have played, its a visual delight to look at..

This is a stupid game... I'm not sure yet whether that's "good stupid" or "bad stupid".

Right now, perhaps something more descriptive like "ludicrous" would do the trick.

Every player on their turn is doing something radically different [at least superficially].

There is a lot going on in this game and after one play I want to play it again as it is different enough to warrant it. 
After a second play I find that there is just too much confusion in the structure of the game for my personal taste.

Solid Euro game.  Interesting dice mechanics.  This typifies the type of game I'm drawn to.  It's not the greatest game (theme-wise or excitement-wise).  But it plays in under 2 hours and you feel satisfied after playing it.

This game has all the ingredients I love: dice placement, events, worker placement, fantastic artwork, yet, it somehow fell flat. It really bugs me how much complexity the game put on itself, just by having so many different currencies and ways to gain points. The iconography is too complex, so you have to look stuff up all the time. If you have a small gaming library, this game is for you, as it really rewards repeated play, but for me, the composition of the game is too much on the heavy side, which is a shame, as the game itself is actually not that hard.

This game is touted way too much by the hardcore Euro audience. As soon as this game gets going, it's over. It's dry, boring, and plays out similarly each time despite the randomized cards. Felt like a cheap knockoff of a Feld game. Possibly my least favorite Euro game that utilizes dice in any kind of interesting way.

Troyes is built on an intricate resource conversion system of money, influence and victory points. What makes it stands out from other games is its use of dice that are acquired through worker placement and rolled each turn to determine their power. However, they can be purchased by other players so much of the game challenge is about which dice to select and when to avoid that someone else takes them first.

Knowledge of card combinations may be too important but since all cards are displayed to all players, I don't expect this to be a major issue.

All in all, Troyes is a game that stands out with both strategic decisions (how do I obtain the resources I need to progress?) and tactical decisions (which dice do I need to use how and when?).

Update: Sold because was I worried that knowledge of card combinations are more important than knowing when and where to use dice.

Complex and involving, but really dry and, for me, the very definition of "pasted on theme".  I never feel that I am fighting off marauding barbarians, just that I am pushing dice and cubes around a board.  And yet, and yet...  Something keeps me coming back for one more play, perhaps the idea that I still haven't quite cracked the depths of this game.

very good strategy game and clever use of dices. Rounds played fast, and probably some insignificant downtime and AP prone on where to allocate the dices and how many to buy, but other than that, the randomized element of Activities and Events make the game less predictable, the secret char also adds up tense, and the dice rolling is always fun. A solid 9 !

Trop compliqué pour rien, trop de cartes différentes, trop de A vers B pour C visant D, trop d'éparpillement, trop de dés, et trop de vols de dés!

Je reconnais que c'est un jeu de qualité, très travaillé. Mais il s'adresse principalement à un groupe d'habitués. Et personnellement, je n'ai pas envie d'en faire partie.

EDIT 2015-06-28: Les commentaires précédents ont été écrits après trois parties jouées. Or, il s'avère que nous jouions en appliquant mal la règle "acheter un dé à un adversaire". Au lieu de calculer le prix d'achat en fonction du lot éventuellement utilisé, nous payions les dés adverses selon la formule "1 dé acheté = 2$; 2 dés achetés = 4$ chacun).

Après avoir rejoué avec la vraie règle, je constate que le vol de dés est un peu moins fréquent. Mon appréciation du jeu (6.2) est par conséquent revu à la hausse (7).

RATING: 9.8
A master piece. There's no game better than this after having played hundreds of Euros.

Everything about it is neat.

- It's very deep. 
- You have a lot of meaningful choices to make in the game. You have a lot of freedom and room for smart and creative play thanks to the dice manipulation and how you can pay for using your opponent's dice
- It's tactical by nature, just like other worker placement game, you need to react according to your opponent's moves
- It's also strategical, as cards that turned up remains face up on the table. You can spend time to craft an engine and reap the rewards when the timing is right
- Unlike the top classic Euro (like Caylus and Puerto Rico), the initial card combination makes every game a refreshing experience
- It doesn't even take long! 60-90 mins playing time, filled with meaningful decisions

Love affair. So awesome. I particularly like it 2plyr because it feels almost like chess - quite short, and oh so sweet. Doesn't get a 10 because the dice can sometimes give one player an unfair advantage, and in a game that is otherwise so "euro-y" it feels a bit wonky. And yes, I know there are ways around the dice - but you still get a bit screwed if you keep rolling 2s and 3s while your opponent is rolling 5s and 6s. Otherwise, brilliant design. I am constantly discovering new things about how ingenious the mechanics truly are.

UPDATE: This game is kind of like a fine wine and is improving with age. Fine, Troyes, I can't deny you a 10 any longer.

In 1200 France, one places their citizens in the bishopric, palace or city hall. This in turn gives you the corresponding colored dice to roll. During your action phase, you use the dice, and you can buy dice from other people, to put tradesmen on cards, counter events, put more citizens on the board, earn money or construct the cathedral. The three different colored dice for your citizens restricts where you can use the dice. 

Only certain activity cards are used per game, so each game will be different. 

In addition, each player is dealt a secret character card, who rewards VPs for doing certain things, which all players can earn. 

I'm looking forward to seeing more of the card combinations, and other strategies. I'm at the point where I realize the secret character cards can swing the game one way or another, without too much of your control, but I like the aspect of the dice buying and thinking about seeding of the citizens in the beginning. There are lots to think about, which I like.

Very unique game. Worker placement, resource management and dice game elements. 2-4 players. 

PROS:
-Variable game setup each time. 
-Low luck as the dice can be modified in various ways and you also buy other players die to use for your own purposes.
-Dynamic game because of the dice rolls. 
-Good player interaction: buying the dice, pushing their workers off board locations.  

CONS:
-The differing crisis cards can be very devastating, especially to some players if unable to defeat it. 
-Is a definite advantage to go first, which varies based on player number and how many turns the game goes for.
-Still a little bit of luck, if its your turn to go first and you roll many 6s, that's great! if you are last and roll many 1s too bad!
-Didn't like the hidden lord cards. If hidden, should only apply to that particular player. As it applies to all players, would prefer to have them face up.

Very good game. You use dice to do actions on the board. You can modifie your die if you pay. The secret objectives offers nice strategies.

My favorite of the the 2010 crop. Great use of dice.

**UPDATE** After a full play at the 2011 GoF, I found my rating held up nicely. This one just feels different from most of the games out there. To address the biggest complaint I hear about this game: don't consider them "your" dice... they are just the dice "you" rolled. Yes, you don't have to pay to use them, but others have to pay you.

Beautiful and exciting game. 

High re-playability. Each time it is almost like a new game, since only some of the cards enter in play. 

It has dice, but luck is balanced by the many ways the players have to influence the dice rolls.

It is quite original and it requires a way to play that requires 3 games or more to appreciate it fully.

I would rate it higher if it were not for the still too much luck (e.g. the events can damage more a player than another) and that the clever tactical moves are more important than the strategy.

I haven't played Stone Age and Castles of Burgundy so I dont have a comparison but I really like this game a lot! The mechanism is great and gives many possibilities, games are not the same due to the different cards that appear in each game, and the number of players gives a lot of variety as well. Yes there is some luck factor due to dice rolling but this is a dice management game and the idea is to make the most of what you have and evolve in the game in the direction that minimises the luck factor. Highly recommended!

1 game. Not sure about it yet. Nice mechanics but it was too long. A lot of things can't be planned though you try to. This leads to AP and sometimes frustration e.g. when you get kicked out 2 times in a row and loose 1 or even more turns.

In this game your dice are your resources.  You are still able to do many different things with whatever numbers you roll due to the clever mechanics.  There are so many options at some points it tends to get a bit over-whelming, and with many strategies most are viable.  Would love to play again to get more familiar with this game.

A great compact mid-weight euro. The dice mechanisms might confuse you if you're used to standard worker placement - but you'll get the hang of it in a turn or two. 

Decent theme - eminently replayable (even without the expansion). 

I sold it off because it wasn't getting plays as opposed to the cult of the new - I do regret doing that though.

RATING: 9.5
It left a great impression after one play, love the balance, love the multiple currencies (deniers, influence points, and victory points). This one is too challenging for newbs, and it is extremely conducive to AP -- probably because many times it felt like there wasn't one optimal move (and maybe there, in fact, wasn't one).  
-------
Second play with more experienced gamers, and it went relatively quickly given the complexity of decision-making, especially mid-game. This game is incredibly difficult to explain though, especially to people who don't have a computer science degree, division concept skills, and/or strong abstract thinking. Just one element after another that I dread explaining, culminating, of course, in the Procession activity card.

I don't even know what to say...this game had me hooked immediately. It's fantastic and very unique.

RATING: 9
Troyes is this close to being another soulless Euro, this time with dice and events a la Kingsburg, worker placement a la Caylus, and passive aggressive sissy-fights a la Hansa Teutonica.  What separates this game from total pastiness is the built-in timer of the dicepool (which forces your decision to become tougher as the pool stays wide, but quickly makes your decisions for you) and the secret end-goal characters (which do a lot to add theme to the game and diversify the play experience for players).  And the artwork, which is fantastic in a low-key way.

Man, how I prefer Troyes to Hansa Teutonica.  It out-Felds Feld and yet it is 50 times more attractive to me than 90% of Feld's library.  I shouldn't like it as much as I do.  But I adore this game.

The expansion, however, is a fucking insult.

It's curious, but this game produced very different sensations. I loved it, but both Alvar and Quegak didn't.

I loved the mechanics, if you mix everything, you have endless ways of playing. Lots of possibilities in every decision. It's a medium depth dice game with almost no luck factor.

The medieval images look graphic design is marvelous.

I dropped what it would have been a higher rating because the game progressed a bit slower than I expected, and also because of the poor reaction of Alvar and Quegak. I will probably improve it with further plays.

RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): Available actions vary more than usually from game to other which should add replayability and certainly makes every game a bit more exciting as they're slowly revealed during first 3 turns. It's a dice game but you can actually balance your bad rolls by using influence so it is not that bad to throw badly (sometimes this is what you might want). My biggest annoyance in the game is that you still need either plenty of money to buy dice from others or your own dice and if others kick your workers out from buildings that give dice then your game suffers. I might not like 4 player game because of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some would say its to random for a strategy-economical oriented game, but I say that its originality resides in the fact that it pits you against a bunch of players AND the random factor.

Based on reading the rules for several dozen Essen games, I rated this as the best of the show already in early September, and the game certainly lives up to the expectations.

Troyes freshens up the worker placement genre with a cunning dice manipulation element, setting it apart from the plethora of games in this overcrowded niche. And it's better than the other dice rollers as well. Perhaps too many ways to score points, but it's the vying for the dice, rather than the points, that makes this game fun. It looks good as well.

Gioco profondo con grande interazione, molto bello malgrado i dadi. Vedendo tutti quei dati ho pensato a un Kingsburg, per fortuna stiamo parlando di un altro tipo di gioco; in Troyes i dati si giocano, si comprano, si vendono, si ritirano, si ribaltano, si lotta per averne uno in più il turno successivo, diventano praticamente risorse e beni da gestire e utilizzare nel migliore dei modo. Le meccaniche possono ricordare Yspahan ma il gioco è più complesso e strategico anche se un tantino astratto; abbastanza simili nella gestione dei dadi troviamo Bora Bora e The Castles of Burgundy, entrambi altrattanto interessanti anche se il mio personale favore rimane per Troyes. Trovo, infine, la risoluzione migliore in quattro giocatori!

Someone described this to me as 'an unholy mixture of mechanics that you don't think can possibly work, but they somehow do'. They're not far wrong: this is a worker placement game shoe-horned into the dice arena and could be absolutely ghastly, thinking about the basic premise. Instead, though, what we have is a game rife with intelligent decisions, made all the better by the secret personality cards which will determine end conditions without being anything as easy as 'obvious'.

Troyes is a dice game where the dice are purchased with cash, then spent to gain victory points and setup scoring and resource mechanisms. The dice are available from a shared resource pool, but players may have more or less access to the pool due to turn order or lack of cash. Troyes has variable setup because different cards will come into play each game.

The components are good, although the English rules are difficult. There are also green and orange player pieces, which is useless for players with red-green colourblindness.

I'm not the biggest fan of medium-heavy Euros insofar as rules complexity goes. I do love a good elegant Euro or Knizia, but some of these "point salad" type games have at least as many exceptions and rules oddities as the greatest Ameritrash offenders. But all in all learning this was a pleasant experience.

I do like the idea of not "owning" particular dice in the workforce, but simply getting a discount on yours. I love the event deck, the solo rules, and the thematic elements. I know it's JASE in a sense, but most of the actions have at least some semblance of theme to them. There is a high degree of connectivity among the rounds, so you need to make sure to set yourself up to have enough dice and coins later on in the game.

I am curious whether this will have legs after I've become proficient at cutting through the crap and figuring out what actions are worthwhile. I am hopeful that the hidden character cards will help with this.

In the end it loses its luster and turns into just another optimization game.

A "mechanisms first" game. Not a pure cube converter, but definitely an optimizer. Some moves are very obviously stronger than other, though. Left a Feldian impression on me. It's probably pretty good for a complex Euro, but not really my cup of tea.

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR][/i]

[i]I haven't had the opportunity to play this again, but I would like to. If I do I will update my thoughts.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I played this early in the month and to be honest I'm having trouble remembering specifics of the game. This is an extremely dry Euro, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't recommend it. I still enjoy these types of games and really enjoyed figuring out how to play this game well. The way the dice pool works adds interaction to the game since someone can always pay you to use your dice. While that sounds like a decent deal you can get truly hosed if you end up not being able to use the dice you need that turn (each group of actions is tied to one of the 3 die colors). Add in the area control element found on the board and you have a really tight, engaging optimization puzzle on your hands.

What makes Troyes stand out is the player interaction combined with the end game hidden scoring objective each person has. You can plan all you want but someone can recognize what you are doing and come in and buy your dice, or bump you out a critical space you need to score your end game objective. You need to pay attention to what other people at the table are doing or you will not be successful. Yet another game I played this month that I really want to get back on the table.[/i]

[q="Morganza"]What did you think of Troyes? [/q]

It wasn't very fun. As prominent games go (i.e. ignoring all the dreck that make up the bulk of the database) I would put it about average - about half games are better, half are worse. Maybe a little below average, say 5/10. I'm not keen to play it again and would actively avoid it and lobby for something else. It's not a 'bad game', just not my cup of tea. I don't like worker placement games. I've not found a definitive reason [i]why[/i], just every worker placement game I have played has bored. I'm engaged the whole time and thinking hard, but I'm not getting any enjoyment out of it. Other meaty games like say 18xx, Puerto Rico, Brass etc. have me thinking hard [i]and [/i]enjoying the game. 

Troyes in particular (which I found out is not pronounced anything like I expected - taught by someone who speaks French) is very much a 'cube pusher', only it's not always cubes being pushed, they might be cardboard tokens or a marker on track or something. Players are supposedly tasked with building a cathedral, by setting up a Rube-Goldberg style chain of interactions that trades prestige for meeples, for dice, for cubes, for money, for cards, for VPs, (or something like that) that hopefully magnifies their resources at each point along the chain.  :snore:  

It's certainly got one or two clever mechanics like buying dice off each other (we only played 2 player, I suppose there'd be a lot more of that going on with 4 or 5 or however many it goes up to), and the meeples giving you more dice to roll (the dice are the primary workers to be placed, not the meeples), but I felt there were a lot of mechanics shoehorned in for no discernible reason.

While most Euro, dice-centric games mandate a certain "blindness" to other player's turns, Troyes made me constantly take note of what other players were doing...then I just took that away from them on my turn. There is an amount of spite generated from "stealing" someone's better die results and "pushing" someone's meeple out of a building but that's natural in a game that encourages interaction and semi-cooperation. The artwork is great and there is re-playability with different character cards, tradesmen and events. Solid game and always a pleasure to play.

Ok, I raised my rating from 4 to 5 after a very nice 4P game which I won by a nice lead.
I still think this game has a horrible Medieval theme, ugly illustration style and too much variety and luck in the cards. It has some redeeming qualities in its mechanics but it's still too chaotic, especially in rounds 4-5 in a 4P game.

Had a lot of hype, and I still thought it was pretty cool.  I think the hidden roles for victory points are sort of meh, but the ability to manipulate the dice before allocation makes the decisions really interesting.  The game is only a few turns long, so making your turns count is important.  Getting in to a pissing contest over the number of die you have ultimately yield no progress.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You set up to earn different coloured dice, where each colour will allow you to take different actions, the number generally driving how many times you can do that action. Which sounds random, but you can use your influence points to manipulate the dice and you can use your money to steal other people's dice, so now you have lots of options, which generates plenty of downtime. Except there's only so many things you can spend them on - get more dice, get vp's, get influence. Each of the first 3 rounds adds some extra actions to invest in (card driven, driving some intra-game variety) but other than that, each round feels pretty much the same. So you feel like you've just played the game 5 times within 90 minutes. That's it, roll the dice, and then go round and round analysing and spending them. At end of game, see who did it all best when all the numerous ways of earning VPs get added up. There's precious little link to theme. It's quite hitty in a Hansa Teutonica type way, killing off people's future dice, hitting them back in return, stealing dice, stealing in return, and that's a nature I don't enjoy in a themeless cube-driven Euro. The other issue I don't like is that you aren't guaranteed a return on your investment. For example, you invest in a yellow building to convert money into VP's, then you find all the yellow dice are used for other things before you even get a go, making your investment useless this turn, and then you're looking for less optimal means of earning VPs which means hitting other people for dice, and so the merry go round goes. Anyway, it hits all the wrong buttons for me.

RATING: 10
Troyes is an extraordinary game.  It has a lot in common with some of my favorite games - Trajan, Le Havre, and Aquasphere.
1) It is highly tactical and reactive, like Trajan.  Following a strategic path feels like La Havre, in that getting from point A to point B in your plan takes longer is and more complex than it initially seems.  But it doesn't shower you with points like Trajan or Le Havre.  It is tight like Aquasphere and has you feeling like you are wiggling and and eeking out points.  Average end-game scores are around 40-mid 50s.
2) It can feel like a head to head struggle where you and your opponents are jockeying for advantage throughout the entire game (once everyone knows how to play)
3) It is a game that you can explore.   You can't oversimplify the game into "just do this strategy and you will win".  You can't "break" the game.  The game is very rich, and complex, and there are many subtle things that involved in decision-making that affect the point struggle.
4) Although similar in feel to Trajan, Troyes' gameplay mechanism of buying dice from other players is very original. Additionally,   all of the things you can do in this game interconnected - and giving any one of them attention effects the others, as well as your opponents.   For these reasons, Troyes stands out as very unique in my collection.

Caveat:  This is a Eurogamer's Eurogame.  Very thinky, and many would find it boring and themeless - like some say about the games I compared it to.  I would say if you like those games a lot, then this would be right up your alley.  For me it fires on all cylinders and it ranks high among my favorite games.

Neat game like nothing I've ever played. A great tactical worker-placement-ish tableu-builder-ish Euro with some strategy without being multi-player-solitaire. Plays better than the heavier Feld games. This has a learning curves due to the mechanisms and how they work together. This also might be considered a gamer's game. AP alert. Good 2 player.

People might consider this game to be math-y, but I don't feel that. I won't ever improve in my playing, but I really really enjoy playing.

What I liked:
- Components, except that the icons should have been more consistent.
- Rolling dice is usually fun.

What I didn't like:
- High complexity. It felt like it was complex just to be complex, and not because it added more to the game.
- Prone to AP, partly because there are too many ways to manipulate the dice.
- You definitely need to learn the cards to use the combos.
- Having each player know one of the end-game scoring bonuses, which means bluffing (which I don't like in games).

The 3.4 weight seems about right. This game is going to appeal to people who like complexity in general.

This game is enjoyable but way too fiddly for our tastes. We constantly have to refer to the rule book to look up cards and events. Plus, taking other peoples dice and bumping them out of buildings is a little too confrontational for our tastes. This gives me the feeling of a medium weight Feld but I would rather play any Feld than this.

12/18/11 - Meeples, cards and dice = fun times. The new trend with dice games is to offer you ways to manipulate them so "bad roles" don't hinder your choices. Troyes has that and you can purchase dice from your opponents. Their better roles can benefit you for a cost. 

I feel I have only scratched this game as it seems there is some nice depth and variety to Troyes. I rate it an 8 at this time.

I was looking forward to this piece cause Kingsburg is quite popular in our boardgame club and this seemed to have some common principles.

Our first four player game take about 2.5 hours including reading rules but the time run out very quickly and it was fun all the way.

The usage of dice is very well devised and the luck factor quite low due to possibility of buying dices from the other player pools and manipulating your own with influence points.

Replayability seems high and I'm looking forward to next games.

Don't let the dice fool you, this is a strategy game. You populate buildings on the board that let you get dice for your future rolls. The dice give you options in order to earn points by using the dice with the various action cards or events to convert them into points. There are a lot of options and you only see a few cards each game so each play will be different. I really enjoyed the mechanic, it has a very original feel.

La vera sorpresa dello Spiel 2010. Un gioco a lungo atteso per il suo utilizzo originale dei dadi e per l'ottima veste grafica (che fa onore a un giovane editore come Pearl Games).
Il fattore sfortuna è paradossalmente limitato: ogni risultato del dado può essere utile, e se non lo è si può sempre ritirare (o capovolgere il risultato). Ci sono un sacco di cose da fare: dalle minacce esterne, alla costruzione della cattedrale, al piazzamento dei propri commercianti presso le personalità della città, all'occupazione dei palazzi di Troyes. 
L'assegnazione dei punti dei personaggi nascosti non è un ulteriore bonus, ma un vero e proprio salto: occorre quindi tener d'occhio il comportamento degli avversari (che conoscono un obiettivo a testa) per capire dove muoversi.
Un gioco estremamente originale e divertente. Chapeau.

Initial rating based on my appreciation of the complex play, theme, and art: 8
Weight: medium-heavy

It would be a 9 if the 2 player game was optimum. I like almost everything about this game.  The highly variable setup is well integrated.  The powers of the four colors of dice are interesting.

One of the things I don't like is how short the 2p game is, and how much the neutral player dominates.  There does not seem to be time to execute a strategy.  We might house-rule on this.

I bought the expansion to make my wife happier.  The first thing she said was [i]why is it all men?[/i]  I think she cares less for historical accuracy than I do.

This is another "dice rolling with a twist" game in the same vein as Kingsburg.  In this game, however, you can actually buy another player's dice by paying him money.  I found the iconography in this game to be horrible, and the art I thought was lousy.  I found myself having trouble really getting into this game, and wasn't sure what to go for, especially considering that some of the scoring objectives were on hidden cards.  Maybe I'd like it better on another play, but I'm not holding out hope.

What a brilliant euro. You control dice, but others can buy them from you. The more dice they use in a turn, the more expensive it is to buy them. I like the constant threat of military cards and fighting for control in the various places. I found this game a bit lackluster with 2 players though. It's not bad by any means, but there are better 2 player games than this.

I'd love to get this to the table more, but I'm the only one who's enjoyed it so far. Honestly with more plays, I could see this being an 8 or a 9.

Note: Fit all of this into the expansion box. Sleeved mainly using FFG sleeves and some remaining Mayday sleeves for the player aid cards and the hidden end game point cards.

A dry, smart and "elegant" euro, if there ever was one. A bit tricky to learn out. A bit game-y too.

It has, as many already pointed out, a "feldian" feel, although it did not remind me of a particular Feld title. On the contrary - as a game it stands on it own and feels rather unique.  

Beautiful artwork.

Strong first rating. I think this one could have great replayability.

Deep worker placement game with dice.  I like the many options of buying other players' dice and bumping off their workers from main buildings.  I like how the black cards come out and cause tactical decisions and sometimes cooperation between players.

I had a bad initial reaction to Troyes.
In part it was due to a rule error.
So I thought that I ought to give it another try.
Well, I just have: as a two player game.
Positive conclusion: it is a better two player game than four player.
Negative conclusion: I don't want to play it again with any number of players, especially not with more than three.

My problems with it: I have no problem with a pasted on theme if it it done well. Sometimes the results are amateur DIY but Troyes joins Trajan as a game where the theme has slid down on to the floor.
This means that I am performing actions that I don't care about and it needs too much thought to be a light, fun game and outstays its welcome.
The dice add luck instead of randomness: not enough dice are rolled, especially with more players, and the effects of being first or last with bad dice can be decisive, especially when there are fewer building slots to occupy. Fundamentally the game does not scale well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have played once in a two-player game.  I tend to like these kinds of "victory point engine" games, and Troyes has some clever, enjoyable mechanics that rarely leave you with nothing at all to do on a turn, and even dropping out of a turn early can get you a benefit.

After a couple plays, I think I just really dig this system.  There are slight nuances to the ways to acquire points, and a few picky rules, but, as I said above, there's almost always SOMETHING you can do on a turn, even on the cheap, and though a lack of money or a lack of influence are handicaps, there are almost always ways around it.  It also rewards clever play, and most certainly long-term play.

I usually hesitate to rate games after 1 play but for me it was clear Troyes was the best game I have played to come out of Essen 2010 and I wanted to give it the credit it deserves.

Great replayability--not only do dice rolls change from game to game but the action spaces and events do as well.

Tough decisions--it's not clear what the best choice is, at least not initially. You have to play from your gut, it's impossible to 'solve'.

Player interaction--buying other players' dice prevents them from being able to carry out their plans but comes at a steep price.

I want to play it again soon as I think this will help me understand better why I enjoyed this game so much,

RATING: 6
Another money-cube-VP worker placement engine game with multicolored dice thrown in. Nothing distinguishes it from many other with the same complexity, some of which is unnecessary.

The 4-player game (3 1st-timers) took 30+ minutes to explain and 2.5 hours to play. Final scores were 47 (1st player with previous experience), 42, 35, and 31 VP.... in player order. It is unfair that the 1st 2 players were first twice, the others only once. This is because the cute dice mechanism strongly favors turn order. Although initially interesting, the dice routine becomes fairly obvious as play goes on which then makes the slow pace, due to no possibility of tactical planning, annoying. Black dice attacks and Cathedral 'building' are just complexity add-ons. Limitless replayability,  by adding dice random elements and a deck of arbitrary (theme-less) cards, does not add up to elegance.

I really liked this game after one play.  There are a lot of decisions and ways to win.  I was not crazy about the rule allowing everyone to score for he secret cards.  It seemed a bit lucky if you got the points.  I know you are to try and figure out what others have, but if it is hidden well it is just luck as to which ones come up.  I would rather known what I need to do and work my strategy.

Kell még vele játszani, mert kettesben kevésbé volt érdekes. Viszont 4-en remek lehet, mert ott minden kijön aminek ki kell. Bár - hála égnek - ritkán játszunk csak négyen. Érdekes a külcsín, kicsit tán komor is, de remekül illeszkedik a játék "témájához".:) Az ikonrendszer kritikán aluli, nehezen értelmezhető és nem egyértelmű, ráadásul csúnya is. Jó kis kombózós játék. Remélem bejön a tippem a 4 főssel kapcsolatban.

Két év után előkerült 4-esben. Hát ez egy igen jó játék. Nyilván jó, hogy nyertem, de végig izgalmas volt és kellemesen feszült játék alatt is(és persze így lenne, ha nem nyertem volna :D ). Kezdem szépnek látni, az ikonrendszer kicsit puritán azért számomra, de ezen túllendülök, mert ilyen kellemes meglepetést rég kaptam játéktól. Kifejezetten jó motorok vannak benne, remekül használja a kockákat. A játék elején azt éreztem, hogy hátrány kétszer utolsónak lenni, ennek ellenére nyertem meg. Játék közben pedig 3 helyre raktam volna magam. A szórás viszonylag nagy volt (47-40-39-30), de mégsem éreztem. Nem tudom előnye ez vagy hátránya a játéknak, de jó volt. :)

I can honestly see where this game is coming from. The first dice allocation game I played was Kingsburg which is probably the most simple of the bunch. I played Alien Frontiers and did not like the theme and found it a tad more complex than the former. Troyes however is the behemoth of the trio and takes the dice allocation mechanic and beefs it up with lots of stuff, rules and tweaks. If you are a fan of the genre, that is, someone who looks for more of the same in a heavier context, Troyes is the go-to game for you. However, I still prefer Kingsburg because the game keeps it simple, focuses more on interaction instead of calculations and brainburning. Troyes takes it one level to far (for me) but I can see why some people might really like it. I am not keen on the fact that you get an advantage by learning the cards by heart either, I do not like that, I want my games to be decided by skill, not by sheer investment of time into preparing for it beforehand.

The upside:
-A game with dice used in an intelligent, non what-do-I care-about-your-plans way. They're resources to manage and not destiny deciders.
-Replayability seems high, with all the possible combinations of cards.

The downside:
-They're still rolling and there's still luck around. I don't think I'll be blaming the dice if I lose here though.

The manner in which dice are used and shared is exceptionally clever... 
But the game stills feels random and uninteresting.
Based on what threats are drawn, and what dice are rolled, there is always a most optimal way to spend one's turn.   The game may as well play itself.

RATING: 6
Boy, this game can really give you a headache. There are options aplenty in every single turn and you really need to be on your toes, because situation can change in the blink of an eye. 

"Troyes" is a very tactical game about mediev... about using random cards (but common for everybody) to create the most efficient engine. There are several things you have to manage: money, influence, points, character tasks and so forth. By using the dice, you activate cards to utilize various effects. Sounds simple? It's not!

I think this one could be almost on par with other dice games I love, particularly those made by Mr. Feld, but it's too convoluted. And there's another big complaint: it's very abstract. The symbols on the cards is all that matters. Theme? Non existent. I could easily list all the important card abilities, but I have no idea what they represent, never bothered to check. Used to enjoy it, but I begin to think there are better medium weight eurogames out there.

I bought this on impulse based on favourable memories of a handful of plays on BoardGameArena. That was a really great decision because I think this has probably become my favourite euro and it is now rather hard to come by. Although games can be as short as 45mins (2 player) there are lots of decisions to be made and I just love the way the game invites you to make a little points/money/influence engine from the opportunities that it throws your way. A top class game.

Good use of dice in a Euro-style game. The ability to buy dice from your opponents helps even out the dice luck; the inability to refuse such a purchase, plus a few "attack" cards, makes this game a bit more confrontational than most Euros.

This game has a pretty steep learning curve.  It's a little fiddly for your first plays.  It takes even longer to feel like you know completely what's going on.

Good replayability....different event cards and artisan cards come out each game, so each game has different tactics available.

Not really recommended for casual gamers.....as it's just too fiddly.  When I played with my daughter, she said: "tell me what to do".....she felt that thinking through the possibilities was more a chore than a pleasure.  I didn't feel that way, but she did.

There is a great implementation of this game on BoardGameArena that you should checkout to see if you like the game.

It is deeply flawed, especially at 3 players, where concerted action against a single player essentially knocks that player out of the game very early.

The hidden scoring cards and multiple paths to points (point salad?) make for a variety of game play styles.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Euro games.

DEEP DICE BASED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GAME
One of those games you have to play to understand.  Dice as a resource to be managed and you have the option to "buy" your opponents dice, manipulate your own dice by expending other resources.  Interlocking operation of dice rolls, influence points, money, and victory points.  At first blush it sounds random, dry, and confusing - which may be your experience for the first couple of turns of play - but it all interlocks beautifully in a very engaging way.  I suspect I will increase my rating with subsequent plays.  This is a dice game that many a euro dice hater will embrace.  [11-10-11]  Also, one of those rare games that shines with 3 players.  My only real complaint with Troyes is that it suffers from a more serious than usual for a Euro case of the theme being COMPLETELY detached from the gameplay - the excellent and evocative artwork is wasted in this regard.   

PSSSST - ALIEN FRONTIERS IS BETTER!

Pretty sure that I'd enjoy the heck out of this one, but at the time I was thinking about buying it I went for Castles of Burgundy instead.  And that's been a big hit.  I would like to try Troyes though.

Edit (Aug 2012): Picked it up in GenCon 2012 Math Trade.  I've played a pretend game with 3 players and a 2-player with my 10 year-old son.  I'll wait to rate until another play or so.  I definitely like it a lot though.

Oct. '12: I've played a "real" game a couple times.  Mostly been playing solo (which is good).  I really like the mechanics but not sure who else of my buddies does.

Nov. '14: Played a 3-player with Bryan F. & Lynn and that's sparked the game getting to the table more.  Lynn and I have played 2-3 games lately (just 2-player) and we really enjoy it.

An interesting game in which players must buy and sell dice in order to gain points by developing a city and building a cathedral. Other than the dice this is fairly routine fare, but the dice are unusual (comparable games are Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers) and add an interesting turn by turn variation in the play. They can lead to analysis paralysis and some confusion over rules - not a light game. However challenging and enjoyable.

When I first played this game, way back in 2011 when I was relatively new to gaming, I thought it was a dull-as-ditchwater dry Euro that was just about saved from utter awfulness due to the hidden character cards which determine end-of-game scoring. But when coming back to it a year or so later, and being much more receptive to Euros in general than I was at first, I saw lots to admire here. Different each time due to the cards chosen for the game (which you don't know until they're revealed in the appropriate round), several different resources to juggle as in any good Euro (chiefly money and influence, but also of course the dice themselves), and never any shortage of hard choices. It's also quite unlike every other Euro I know. Tends to be fairly low-scoring (perhaps we're all still terrible at it, but typical scores seem to be in the 30-40 range), so every single VP you can eke out can make a big difference. It is a good game - both interesting and fairly unique, with no shortage of tough decisions - yet in the final analysis it is difficult for me to love, and I can't remember the last time I felt like I wanted to play it.

A good and interesting game, although the rules and mechanics take some getting used to, even experienced gamers have been seen asking "hang on, how does that bit work again?" but once you start getting a feel for it, things become much simpler.

There are many routes to victory, the trick is combining your dice (and those bought from others) with the cards that allow you to perform various actions (boosting die rolls, converting money to VP or influence, buying dice for free etc) and since these cards change every game what worked last time may not work this time!

If you like heavy Euro Gaming combined with dice and worker placement, this game will probably be right up your street.

(+) Original mechanism
(+) Lots of variety and replayability due to different actions every time you set up the game
(+) I hate dice games, but in Troyes the dice-mechanism is implemented very elegantly
(+) The game does not outstay its welcome: it plays rather quickly and smoothly for a game with quite a serious 'depth'.

(-) Depending on the card actions, the combination of dice rolls and initial starting player there can be quite some randomness in the game. This is also the case in how certain 'event'-cards play out at the beginning of each round.
(-) I like the original mechanism, but to some players the game might feel a bit 'dry'.

Definitely a game that deserves praises, not least for the use of unusual game mechanics. Yet, at the same time, there is a bit too much optimisation for optimisation's sake going on, and a few too many rinse-and-repeat combos to exploit which IMO takes the game from great to OK.

There are a lot of rules to take care of. Playing this again after a pause of several months, I am overwhelmed by the complexity. But then after three, four rounds the rules are clear again and the 'flow' begins. Each game is different because of the different cards used. I also like the mechanic of using the dice for the actions - it's innovative. Great game!

In a 4 player game, there are 6 rounds. At the beginning of each round, all players are defending the city of Troyes from outside marauders by working together. Immediately after, all players turn on each other in a ruthless attempt to have control of each of the 3 buildings (Commerce, Military, Church) in the city. There is tension on every turn in this game. That's what makes it a great game.

The amount of options in a single turn can be staggering, especially during the first half of the game.

--Jan2011-- Many thanks to Tom@boardsandbits.
On one play, an appealing (not to mention graphically sensible) friendly Euro.  There's probably a lot more possibilities for denial than we saw the first time out:  but it appeared that we were better off taking actions to acquire points than taking actions to deny our opponent the points.  Intriguing system; looking forward to more plays.

Amidst a trend of cube converters, Troyes stands out as something different.  Dice allocations is very interesting once a gain.. and much of the luck is mitiageted.  I enjoyed the worker placement and the dice rolling and only really had an issue with the turn order, but as I have found out we played a rule wrong (being allowed to use displaced workers) and it likely would have saved me a very useless round.

Decent enough to play, but I doubt I'll be adding it to my collection.

You play a Builder of a new Castle in France, the Troyes. It's a dice-driven game without much luck involved, as you can always use other player's dice to build for your own. Everyone gets a secret goal to achieve, which means, if you are familiar with the goal cards, you probably know what is at hand of others. It's a little bit hard to grab a good strategy at first try. It has potential, I suppose.

Fun dice game, with a critical turn order flaw.  Turn order can really be a huge boon for a few of the mechanisms (Claiming top spot in some of the events, taking new 'building' cards using the high value dice, etc...) and some players are going to have more chances going first than other players in lower player count games.

Undoubtedly a well designed game. The cards are used in a way that each game is different and the use of dice is unique. In the end to me this is a bit too chaotic but still mechanical and abstract. I will gladly play again if and when somebody suggests it.

Very interesting game with an intriguing game mechanics, where the roll of the dice may or may not affect your gameplay. If your roll is not what you want, you can opt to purchase dice from your opponents, and get your desired count.

As my buddy Jack says.. I need this game like I need air. Best use of dice in any Euro game imo. Incredible artwork by Roche, good pacing, perfect lenght, insane interaction, semi co-op aspects, replay value is skyhigh, strategic and tactical gameplay. Just a GEM! Own Ladies of Troyes expansion. If you like this one, track down the expansion assp. The amount of replay value it adds is gigantic, check out the expansion entry for in depth comments about it. Fully sleeved.


Update:  I have lowered the rating because the gameplay, as brilliant as it is, isn't as elegant as I would like. It's quite a complex a game with lots of rules to remember, and my g/f hasn't enjoyed it much in the last two plays. Still an amazing game though, but I'll be moving it from my top 10 for the time being.

Got a good offer and off it went.

As dice manipulation games go, where you pick a couple of dice from a set and perform an action based on the combination of pips showing, it is the heaviest and the best. Paradoxically, there's relatively little luck involved and a better player will almost always win. I don't like this genre, but will make an exception for Troyes and play it from time to time.

RATING: 8
After further play this comes in at a rock solid 8 for me. A very clever use of dice in a quick Eurogame that rewards further play after you become familiar with the cards, card combinations and actions. If it was a long game I might not rate it so highly, but because it only takes 30 minutes I find it's not overstaying its welcome.

Quite a simple game really. The simplicity allows you to spend your energy evaluating the puzzle that is how best to build your VP engine. The angst comes from the rapidly dwindling dice supply each turn and whether you'll have enough turns and dice to get what you need to get done.

I'm not sure I understand any criticism of this game based on people "stealing" your dice. They don't steal them, they pay for them. Roll good dice and you can anticipate them being bought off you if you wait too long. Build your prestige and pay to convert your bad rolls a little later in the round perhaps. There are wonderful options available that keep you on your toes throughout. You can pay for others or use all your own for free. The escalating dice cost is a beautiful mechanic. It rewards specialisation and turn order timing and the steady building of a plan. Rather than this being annoying I find it to be one of the main attractions of the game. You have to juggle your building spots for the right to roll more dice versus using your turn to generate points or all the other option of where to use the dice. You've always got to be thinking of a plan B and a plan C for generating points and repelling invaders and and and. There are options and planning and a good level of thought. I play games exactly for this sort of interaction. I'm not looking for  solo gaming experience, I'm looking to plan for and react to other players.

The problem I can sometimes see with the game is that more fun will be had on an imaginative path to VP generation, but that won't necessarily guarantee a win over the dull path to VP generation. Allow me to elaborate: Due to circumstance and playing style you'll either be having an entertaining and thought provoking game juggling dice and cubes while you buy up essential dice before others get to them, or you'll have decided on your VP strategy early and the game will devolve into a boring exercise in sameness for you over each round. It's easy to find yourself in a position where you've set yourself up early, nothing better presents itself and you're simply following a solid yet ultimately dull path to VP riches. Now some might argue that the fun comes from deviating from that path slightly and trying to squeeze an extra VP over here and deny your opponent dice they need over there, but even playing this way won't generate enough interest for this player. I think this problem is caused by certain strong VP generating cards coming out early in the game - especially if they're combined with character card objectives pushing you down a certain path (like acquiring event cards).

All in all it's a tight package with excellent re-playability, nice artwork and most importantly a clever and forgiving use of dice that makes it different from the other engine building VP generating games out there. I'm not 100% convinced of the balance of the craftsmen cards but I'm looking forward to further play.

Troyes really caught our house by storm earlier this year. After sitting on my shelf unopened for a few months, I opened it up, and my wife and I subsequently played it 4 times. Excellent game that easily deserves its high ranking.

Troyes is a Euro with dice, but different than Castles of Burgundy or Bruges. The dice represent your workforce, but not really with worker placement. The interaction comes in the form of buying dice from other players, which effectively steals from them. The action options provide different strategies to stack together, and lots of good, balanced win conditions.

This is a great 2-player game that I expect I will enjoy at other player counts, too. I'm really glad I have this one.

(Note: I spent 4 1/2 months of my LDS mission in the actual city of Troyes, a town I love quite a bit, a fact which helps me enjoy the game even more.)

One play and we got DESTROYED by the player who had played multiple times before. 

I really like the way it uses dice, but it was pretty convoluted...and not really memorable. 

It seems weird that there aren't an equal number of chances to be 1st player--especially when the first player has the advantage of going first (obviously, but it's a big one here) but also the fact that they have to fight off baddies first.

I'm still deciding on this one.  The dice mechanics are well rounded in giving the players many opportunities to work around.  The cards add variation between games, but also leave some choices that go largely unused do to the items other options available. The diverse strategy prevailed in the first game, but I wonder if tightly specialized builds could work as well.

Just fell flat for me. I couldn't get into the mechanics and it felt bland. Nothing really wrong with the game, but I don't get nearly as much enjoyment out of it as I expected to.

This game is likely a 10, but I'm only three plays in - so I'm going to wait and see. But first off - I adore the design and layout of this game. The rule book, everything is so well executed.

And every game of it has been a pleasure so far. One of the unusual things about this game is how much player interaction there actually is here. Stealing dice, pushing people out of office, taking limited spots on the various cards. This game can be pretty mischievous! Even the black die can be used against opponents - by waiting to eliminate event cards until right before your turn comes around.

My only question at this point is: will it last? That's what I need to find out.

An interesting game that seems to have melded Kingsburg with a few other games.  I like the event cards being something that we have to fight as a whole and I underestimated the value of letting some of the other players fight the black dice.  The activity cards seem like they could lend themselves to some nice combos.  I wish there was a way to get more people into the main buildings as I ended up with way too many in hand.  My biggest concern is that this is NOT a game to play with anyone who tends to suffer from AP as there are a lot of decisions to pick from.  All in all, though, a pretty nice game that definitely requires additional plays.

Played it again and I really enjoyed it the second time.  This has potential to go to a 9 for me.

After my latest play, Troyes is a 9 and has passed one of my all-time faves - Le Havre - to get into my top 5.

Troyes is now officially a 10 for me.  It is wonderful and I need it like I need air.

A single action is mind-warping: buy this to take that to place here to activate this to do that to gain this and that and also move the other thing. And you have a bunch of different options on every turn.

Bad luck on the dice is bad luck, but not quite as bad as other games, since you can buy other people's dice (but then you lose money).

It's a very nice game for all that, the best dice placement game I know so far.

Been playing over at BoardGameArena - took me a couple of games to even pick up the basics, and now strategy is eluding me to the point where I get my behind handed to me every single game, but I keep being compelled to go back. There are a few bits I don't like, such as the randomness applied at the end by having every character card effect the score of every player even though you don't know what characters are in play other than your own, but over all a very interesting game.

There are a lot of different things to do, which is bad for AP-prone players (like Michelle). Since the cards change every game and are temporarily unknown, you can't "practice" with a specific setup to improve your understanding of the game. (Compare, eg, to careful analysis of Dominion's "first game" setup.) 

We will need to get the play time down, if this is going to hit the table much. Last game took us 90 min (2-player). Way too long. Wife's AP is a problem, but I'm not much better when she uses dice I was hoping to use myself (hers or mine or the neutral player's). This happens a lot more often now that I told her to do it more often :-/

Dice, Worker Placement. I like this as much as I had hoped I would. The worker placement just determines how many of which dice you get to roll; the heart of the game is how you spend those dice. After the first play, I saw I could have done X, Y or Z to earn more points or be more efficient; after the second play, I saw how nasty you could get with some of the actions -- this game is definitely not multiplayer solitaire.

I want to play more! Looking forward to it. Are there expansion cards out? I want them!

Finally traded this away because it seems a little tough to teach and nobody seemed that excited by it. I'd kind of like to get it again though.

A 2010-es esseni játékmegjelenések egyik legfelkapottabb játéka a Troyes. Tökéletesen értem, hogy miért, mégis azt mondom nekem ilyen típusú játékra nincs szükségem. Miről is van szó. Egy komoly, mélyen kidolgozott, a sokféle lap miatt változatos mechanizmus mellé kitalálták, hogy mi lenne, ha kockákkal bolondítanák meg. Tehát egy komoly gémer játékot alkottak kockákkal. De hisz ez óriási ellentmondásnak tűnik és sajnos a játék bizonyítja, hogy az is. Nehéz összefoglalni a Troyes-t, de megpróbálom. Az öt körös játékban három helyre 3 kör alatt egy-egy kártya kerül, egy helyen pénzt lehet szerezni az utolsó helyszínen pedig befolyást és győzelmi pontot kaphatunk egy jó kis mechanizmussal. A kártyákon akciók hajthatók végre, amik vagy a kockáinkat befolyásolják vagy különböző módokon befolyás és győzelmi pontokat hozhatnak. A három kártyás helyszínhez egy-egy szín tartozik, amelyeken ott levő munkásaink darabszáma alapján kapunk kockákat a kör elején a megfelelő színben, amivel dobásunk után ezeket felhasználhatjuk. Sőt, pénzért el is orozhatjuk egymás elől. Ezek előtt azonban közös várunkat még a veszélytől is meg kell óvnunk dobott kockáink felhasználásával. Tehát egyrészt meg kell gondolnunk, hogy a 3. körtől 3 helyszín 3-3 lapjai, még két helyszín és az összes megjelent veszélylapka közül hova használjuk el dobott kockáinkat vagy ellenfeleinkét. Ebből is látszik, hogy komoly gondolkodós játék, de ha 1-eseket dob az ember, mert a kis számok a kedvezőtlenek, megdől minden. És ezzel tulajdonképpen az egész játék mivolta megkérdőjeleződik számomra. Persze lehetőség van a kockáinkat újradobni vagy akár átfordítani is, de ezekért befolyáspontokat kell beáldoznunk, ami újabb munkások felhelyezéséhez szükséges, illetve nagyon fontos más dolgokhoz is. Túl értékes és kevés van belőle, hogy erre szánjuk, illetve ha erre költjük, másra nem jut. Az egyik kedvenc játékom az Alea Iacta Est, ami szerintem méltánytalanul alulértékelt játék. Az persze sokkal egyszerűbb, mint a Troyes, de ott minden kockaértéknek, a kicsiknek is fontos felhasználási helyük van. Sajnos nem tudok mit kezdeni a Troyessel, nekem ez a játék, mint már korábban említettem egy órási ellentmondás. Szeretem a kockajátékokat, de eszembe nem jutna mély gémerjátékot képzelni mellé. A tábla kinézete nagyon komor, nem is igazán mondható szépen kidolgozottnak, kártyák nagyon szépek ugyan, de az ikonozással már korántsem voltam kibékülve, persze az díjazandó, hogy nem szöveggel oldották meg őket. A szabálykönyv sem sikerült túl jóra, sőt. Nem véletlen a BGG-n jelentkező sok felmerülő kérdés. 

[2015-05-16]
Kapott még egy esélyt, bár nem kellett volna. Továbbra is ugyanaz róla a véleményem. Több kérdés is felmerült a szabállyal kapcsolatban, a kártyák leírásai se teljesen egyértelműek és továbbra is a szerencse és a túl komoly játék kombinációjának tartom, ami számomra nem működik. Többet nem szívesen játszom vele. Lehet a 4 pont is sok rá részemről.

My favorite dice-as-workers game.  It grabs my love of stringing together disparate cards/action/abilities into an engine.  I really like that we all have the same board in front of us and it's just about who figures it out first.  I also really like the choice of using your dice or someone else's dice.

Troyes is an excellent worker placement game - with dice!  The art is unified with a medieval flavour which matches the events and action spaces, and the complex but ultimately logical systems create an environment that is competitive, cut-throat, and deep.
I confess that it is a challenge to teach, being a little less-than-intuitive for people who do not play heavier Euros.

This game has a bit of a luck aspect but not only that but a strategic side of it. No matter what you roll with your dice it can be placed at a number of locations on the board. I like the different aspects of the game and I could see my group playing it a lot.

What an amazing game.  When you think of Euro games, you immediately think of no dice. When dice are involved, you think of Ameritrash games (i love both, by the way). But Troyes managed to make a Euro strategy game out of dice rolling.  

This game reminds me of Caylus with dice.  Heavy worker placement, and very difficult decisions to make each turn.  The ability to use/steal your opponents die rolls is an amazing mechanic.  It makes turn order matter all the more.

Rating after only one play.  I think the rating will go up if I could play it more often; the first game was mostly figuring out what I was doing.  I like the dice mechanic for action selection, and the ability to buy other people's dice.  It's like Yspahan on crack.  It feels less dry than Caylus, but I think Carson City is probably a better fit for me.

there are a lot of really interesting decisions to make here and i like that after a few plays i'm still pretty far away from esconcing myself in the strategic meat of this experience. the board and it's colors are also quite nice to look at.

i've come to the conclusion that i don't much care for the use of dice in euros (true in castles of burgundy and alien frontiers as well) i seldom criticize a game for a theme falling short of the quality of it's mechanisms, but there is a disconnect for me with the abstraction of dice rolls and actions they create within the setting of the game.

Troyes is a resource management game with non-obvious strategy. Usually in games like this you build your engine in the first part of the game before running it into the ground just before the game ends. Not so in Troyes, which is much more tactical and far less rewarding of resource hoarding. You don't get points for everything at the end of the game. Also, there's meaningful interaction between players. You have to consider your opponents' plans, otherwise you'll lose.

Troyes is not the kind of game I typically enjoy, and yet I do enjoy it, almost despite myself. It's far from my favourite, but I recognize that it's a good example of its kind. And I'd probably add an extra point to my rating if the icons weren't so unintuitive, a pet peeve of mine.

RATING: 9.5
Love the concept, love the mechanics, and (sorry) love the theme, even if it IS overdone. Troyes does it well, though. Lots of satisfying decisions to make each round. Strategically, for me it seems to hit that sweet spot between "scripted" (like Puerto Rico) and "wide open" (action point games like Tikal).

It is yet another example of a "hey that's a cool way to use dice" game. After several plays, I'm still not entirely certain that you can compensate for rolling poorly. Still, a fun game.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows several areas, each of which corresponds to a different color of die and have several spots in which to place workers, and most have places for cards of the same color (which also may have workers placed on them). Everyone starts the game by placing some workers on the board, each of which will provide a die of matching color. At the start of each round, roll all your dice (and some neutral if playing with fewer players than the maximum allowed) and place them in the matching player (and neutral) areas on the board. Then, fight the external threat cards sort of like Kingsburg, but sequentially in turn order. Then, in turn order, round and round, either pass (for rest of the round) or take an action. Actions require spending various combinations of dice -- from your pool, or dice you buy from other players' pools. Buying dice, though, is expensive: each die costs 1 coin per total number of dice you're using this action (1 = $2, 2 = $4 EACH, 3 = $6 EACH). The combinations (of specific number and color of die) needed depend on what you're trying to do: placing workers on cards, using actions on cards, recruiting new workers, etc. The actions generally earn you money or VP. After a specific (5?) number of rounds, the player with the most VP wins.

RATING: 7
I love worker placement mechanics but because there are so many good worker placement games out there I'm perhaps more scrupulous with them than other games and mechanics.  This one is a winner because it does a lot of things that feel new.  Unlike Alien Frontiers it also melds dice rolling and worker placement in a way that works and makes for interesting strategic and tactical decisions.

The game has a few different phases that make up an entire game round.  First a new activity is revealed for the first three rounds.  Then players acquire money and subtract from that wages based on how many dice they get to roll that turn.  Then they roll dice which will determine which actions they can take that round.  Then the game slaps all the players around a little bit with an event before they can actually take actions.  Finally, the players take their actions.

The coolest mechanic in this game is the ability to buy dice from other players.  This reminds me a little bit of the work contract mechanic from Ora et Labora and I loved it in that game as well.  As long as a player has the funds to do so they can steal good rolls right out from under you.  It opens the game up a lot and makes for some very interesting decisions and plays.  It almost has you hoping you roll POORLY!

I think what makes this game work when combining dice rolls with worker placement where I felt Alien Frontiers did not work is that the majority of the actions only care about the total value of the dice used.  That value is divided by some number and the results of your actions are calculated based on that simple arithmetic.  This is starkly different from Alien Frontiers which mostly required runs, doubles, triples, etc. to activate spaces.

Also, Troyes has a small amount of variety.  There are a few different activities and events that are randomly chosen each game.  Each player also has a secret role that gives ALL players bonuses at the end of the game based on certain criteria.  This is another great element of the game that has you both trying to accomplish your goals without advertising them too much AND trying to guess what the other players' roles are.

All in all a great worker placement game with some real good depth and options without really being overbearingly complicated.  The variety is a little skimpy for my usual tastes but its a good enough game that the Ladies of Troyes expansion is probably a definite buy in the near future.

A solid design with a few new mechanics using dice. What I like in the game is the balance between each of the strategies open to each player but also the relevance of each action you take. Everything seems to matter and there's no space for common think and distractions. What I don't like on the game is almost the same thing: a dice game, full with color but heavy and dry as a desert, meaning that the authors took the easy, relax have fun component usually provided with dice and turned the game into an authentic maths exercise. A gamers game that I need to play more to understand every nuance on the cards because it turned out to be, as the final result showed, a card game moved with dice!

I still have some doubts about the importance of dice result as a winning factor. In a 2 player game it seems that the luck factor can be more significant than with more players.
In the bright side of the game are the dice mechanism and its novelty. On the dark side of the game is the long time strategy feeling (which I don't have in the game) and also the dice! They can be more relavant than I would like them to be. 

UPDATE:
After playing the game a few more times with 2/3/4 players I like it better with 2/3 than with 4 (because it's so much more time consuming and uncontrolled) but then again it's just a small difference, nothing too relevant that I wouldn't like at all.
I still believe that in the 2 player game the difference of results in the dice can be crucial. Maybe because with more players, players can buy dice from each other at reasonable prices without loading the opponent with too much money establishing a huge difference. In a 2 player game if a player buys a better die from the adversary (a few times) he would load his opponent's wallet constituting this a big handicap to himself.

I was sure this game is totally my style. But after 3 plays I felt it too "dry", too much to calculate turn by turn and no fun.

The mechanics make the game. The dice selection, cost and the relationship between the WP side of the game are the hook.

Beyond that its just another 'build a cathedral', 'fight the invaders' , etc, etc.

However, the hook is enough to make this a game I like playing

After 5 plays the novelty is beginning to wear off. Turn order and what you roll make too big a difference for this to be a great game

Awesome dice worker placement game (luck is mitigated) with some strategic depth and so many intertwined paths and ways to manipulate things in order to get what you want accomplished.

While working through how you'll manipulate the action cards to get what you want, you always have to be mindful of what dice and values are left so that you know how your opponents can possibly affect you on the next turn and upcoming turns.  Hey may take one die that you planned on using next turn, or he may be able to harm your current board position (kick you out of one of the buildling) depending on what dice are left.

Love the game! One of my top games.

+ Fantastic design; so much to do with so little time and resources to do it.
+ Great renewability with the occupation and event cards and with the dice.
+ I like the constraints this game brings. I like to be limited in a open system.
+ Everything is about optimising your turn, but long term planning has to be accounted for.
+ It's complimented by awesome medieval artwork by Alex Roche.
DISLIKE
- Not much I dislike. There can be a little bit of king making depending on players, but with hidden VP it's minimal.

I'm really fascinated by this design. A great take on worker placement and resources management!

RATING: 7.5
Troyes soars head and shoulders above the also-ran dice allocation games, the likes of Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers -- though perhaps not Macao -- by simple expedient of making it possible to buy others' dice. It sounds insane, but it works: a lot of the time you won't want "your" dice anyway, so it doesn't matter if someone else has rolled better than you. You just buy theirs. Or, if you roll spectacularly badly, you can spend some influence to make your dice spectacularly good instead.

Of course it's not [i]quite[/i] that straightforward; there's good reason to jockey for dice-workers. Of course there's a luck element -- if the stars align and give you good dice at the right time, you can have a truly spectacular turn. (Or the reverse.)

But Troyes has so many ways to mitigate poor rolls that the dice aren't something you have to dread. I'm used to hating evil dice that occasionally, grudgingly give me something I can use. Here, they're not threatening at all, they just contribute to a uncertain tactical landscape. That, I love.

Also, beautiful artwork.

I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I really liked Royal Palace so I wanted to try more by this designer. After the rules were first explained I was a bit overwhelmed by the choices and the board and I really thought it was going to be boring. Also I generally say that I don't like dice. (Several designers have come up with such novel ways to use them in Yspahan, Kingsburg, Macao,Castles of Burgundy and Troyes so I'm really going to have to stop saying that!) Anyway, game play becomes actually very smooth and interesting after only a couple of turns and there is a lot to keep all players engaged. Looking forward to playing again.

Scoring at the end can be somewhat "random" because you don't know which goals are in the game and which aren't (I know you can make a guess, but sometimes you're just misinterpreting the signals of the other players).

Actions. Dice. Cash. Influence. VPs. Medieval.

You need to get clear in your mind how you can obtain cash & influence. I've had a couple of players say in turn one "I can't think of [i]anything[/i] useful to do", and they need to be steered a bit. Predicting which dice will be there for your next turn seems almost impossible, so it might seem chaotic or prove AP-prone. Even after 9 plays, some action cards need to be checked because the icons aren't always particularly helpful.

The glaring flaw I see with Troyes is the randomness and luck. Not in the dice as that is mitigated with the ability to buy other player's dice, but in the action cards that are flipped over. Since the different action cards are face down, it is impossible to predict what the most valuable combo of cards will be. If one player invests heavily in a card that gives bonuses to yellow dice, and it just happens that later on yellow dice are the most powerful cards, they have a huge "first mover" advantage by sheer luck.

The only suggestion to fix this problem would be to play with all action cards face up, just with the ability to only use the cards that would normally be face up (first card for first round). The incoming encounters would still be random, but that is relatively minor compared to some of the game breaking overpowered action cards that can show up on turn 3.

Dear Xavier Georges,

Stop.  Just stop.  Stop adding in tons of rules and burying an otherwise fine game in ludicrous amounts of superfluous rules.  Less is more, dear sir.  Find a way to make something simple like Royal Palace again instead of games like Troyes or Carson City where you bury the essence in a pile of rules.  It's not needed and while you may feel like you're being clever or proud of making a complex and deep game, all your doing is being complex for the sake of complexity.  Again, less is more.

Thanks,

Not a worker placement but a resource assignment.
Clever mechanic where everyone throws their set of dice at the same time. Then on your turn you use your dice and can buy the dice from any opponent who has what you need.But the more you buy the more it costs: exponentially, so no rampant buying.
The greatness of this game is the Butterfly Effect of slightly different starting conditions lead to radically different games.
Resources are spent in several medieval economy themed places and for the first three rounds a new card for use becomes available at each economy spot(defence/ Attackers/ Religous/ Trade- and a Cash Convertors).
 It is how you use your limited money and turn order to occupy these cards that make each game so different from one play to the next.
90mins to play- but it is full on thought so time flies.
Fantastic game one of my all time faves.

Dice rolling/allocation and worker placement hybrid that isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is. Players begin by placing meeples in one of three sections of the city relating to military, religious and civil developments. If the players' meeples are still in those areas at the start of their turns, they get dice corresponding to each of them, and depending on what numbers they roll the dice can be used to perform different actions. These can range from fighting invaders from outside the city, helping to build the cathedral, or acquiring victory points on certain event cards. There seem to be a lot of decisions on offer at any one time in 'Troyes' but overall players are probably best advised just to go for the victory points when they're available, which leads to an overall impression of the game being deceptively shallow. Nevertheless 'Troyes' does have its merits but it probably lags behind other dice allocation games such as 'Kingsburg' and 'Alien Frontiers' somewhat on account of a lack of diversity in the strategic options it provides.

Troyes was easy enough to learn but a pain to teach as all the rules need to be front-loaded. The poor iconography doesn't help in the slightest. Cards are easily misinterpreted if you don't read the descriptions. The game seems to be about finding the one or two decent card combinations and then doing them as much as possible to get points. First impressions suggest that since there's only 4 rounds decisions and actions outside of your control or just bad luck with the dice in a majority of rounds can seemingly cripple a player. The outside threats seem to work fine as do the hidden scoring conditions. As a system the game seems to work but as a game I was left cold, just calculating point differentials whilst trying to screw over the other players. No sense of progression, no thematic connection. I love the art but I don't think this will be staying. 
Hidden VPs seems ridiculous in this sort of game and add to the chit count which is always a bad thing.

This is a fantastic game.  I've played it 4 times, and it's gotten better each time.  Although there's a large amount of randomness with the dice rolling, it really doesn't *feel* all that random most of the time.  The ability to manipulate dice & purchase dice from other players adds some strategy.  It's a very player-interactive game, with multiple pathways to gain points. There are a lot of different mechanics going on in this game, which makes it fairly complex.  They flow quite well once you understand how they work together, but I would not recommend this for a starter game, and even casual gamers familiar with things like Settlers or TTR may find it daunting at first.

RATING: 7.5
Deep game with good replayability right out of the box. It has a number of proven mechanics which mesh well with each other to create a unique experience.

First, there's dice and dice allocation. Roll dice, allocate them to do stuff. Fun, adds a natural tension (as you start chucking those dice). Good design is that there are no 'bad' rolls, only rolls that fit or don't fit with your current strategy. As a big rule of thumb, high rolls are better but you'll need your lows as well.

Second, random hidden bonus cards. Always work well. The catch here is that it is not your personal bonus, but bonuses for everyone that are only revealed at the end of the game. Clever.

Third, economy of three variables: money, influence, and actions. You'll have to manage all three to acquire VPs. When/how you 'eat' into your own engine to start getting these VPs is a big strategic decision. And there are multiple ways to get those VPs: battling events, building a cathedral, claiming or using action spaces. Which one is right for you depends on the actions, the bonus cards in the game and your opponents.

Fourth, claimable action spaces enabling you to do unique stuff. Or nearly, as one other person gets to share the fun but that's it. But they cost you money and influence so when to 'invest' and when to 'hold off' is a big tactical decision.

Fifth, a track (the events) that results in making the board 'tighter' towards the end of the game, making for a natural tension creep. 

Finally, and this might be the best decision: you can use other players rolls, effectively 'stealing' them for money. This results in some very tactical gameplay around using/stealing dice from others for your own good/their detriment. This can feel as 'nice' or 'cutthroat' as you like: simply need more points for an action? Just buy the highest die in that color available to you. Need to bleed out someone so they can't use their action? Just scoop up whatever they have for some measly gold they can't effectively use anymore. Juggling between those priorities will be a big thing and this, coupled with the hidden bonus card mechanic (so you will want to know where someone is aiming for) makes you pay attention to other players' turns. Which alleviates one big draw-back of most euros: multiplayer solitaire. This game gets rid of the 'solitaire' (unless played as a single player game), which is a very good thing.

Rating is tentative, as I have only played this a couple of times, but I expect it to go up in time. If your gaming group is into Euros, doesn't shun dice and likes to figure out a puzzle this might be very well the game you'll be playing now for years to come. 

Very good design, another hit by Xavier Georges (Carson City, Ginkgopolis some other examples).

For me, this game is similar to Kingsburg, except there is many more decisions to be taken and even if someone else takes where you want to go, you still can go there.

This got off to a rocky start due to the rules explanation seeming to be longer than the actual game! Once we were underway, the tightness of the play timetable reminded me of Magnum Sal. All that die rolling reminds me that I need to stop using my Stone Age cup for all games and just but a dice tower already! Update with 4 players: The game is longer (6 rounds vs. 4 rounds with 2 players). Still can suffer from the same level of AP though!

RATING: 6.8
I really like this. It isn't as complicated or as long as it looks.

I'm not a fan of the art or the iconography on the cards, but it works well enough. There is also just enough hidden information (the role cards) and variety in the 3 phase cards to keep this game looking like it have some longevity.

Update: I'm starting to get a little frustrated with the way the cards are revealed; if you set up in turns one and two to generate money and no money->VP card comes up, your strategy is basically ruined and you're scrabbling around trying to change everything halfway through. Perhaps I should set up for a variety of possibilities, but then it feels like a player might get lucky and go all-in on one strategy that might turn out to be viable this time around... Needs more plays to experiment with...

Rating down from 7.6 to 6.8 as this continues to frustrate me.

One play and the owner said the play was atypical. The black dice and gray "player" proliferated, greatly reducing any ability to do something about the situation. If it were a cooperative game, or we had some reward for cooperating a bit, the game wouldn't have been taken over by the zombie player. It was not a pleasant game, but I don't think I understand the game well enough to write it off at this point. However, the luck is strong in this one. [2011]

[2017] A more typical play, I suppose. Still too lucky for my taste.

The very first dice game I admit is superior to my own Kingsburg.
Troyes has a clever way to use dice, merged with smart compensation mechanics, some interaction but not too heavy direct interaction, very little (if not at all) kingmaking and bash the leader. May suffer a little of runaway leader, but usually doesn't.
Great, great, example of smart game design.

Tentative rating. This game fascinates me. I'm just not sure if it will hold its 9 rating after I figure it out. If I ever figure it out... But anyway, until then it fascinates me and deserves a 9. 

It does involve dice rolling and that can be too much luck for my taste in the long run. There are ways to mitigate luck though. If you have money, you can buy dice from other players. If you have prestige points, you can re-roll your own dice or flip them for example making 1 into 6 etc. 

Cards make every game a bit different, hence offer replayability, not luck.

An excellent dice-management game.  It was a tough decision between this and Alien Frontiers.  Overall, Troyes has more interaction between the players, and methods to block opponents.  As well, Troyes allows for re-rolls and other methods to manipulate the die rolls, which does help players who have bad streaks with rolling.

A really fun game, and offers many paths to victory.

Kingsburg introduced me to dice placement, but this adds a ton more depth. Every choice you make is an intense juggling act with a lot to think about. So why don't I like it even more? Well, while being able to purchase other player's dice is interesting, I find it a headache to then be able to plan ahead, as well as with the randomness of the cards. And it is absurdly short.

I dunno why, but Troyes didn't much appeal to me. There's a lot going on, and there's definitely room for some clever play as you get different card powers to boost your strategy. That sort of thing often appeals to me. But Troyes simply felt fiddly, and the random screwage seemed out of place. I'd play again, but Troyes is definitely not a game I'm ever going to love.

Played once with 3 players and once with 2 players. The 3 player learning game took quite a while to learn the rules and then consider all the options available while coming up with a decent strategy. The 2 player game (each of us had played once) took one hour. This is a great game where there are enough mechanisms to overcome unlucky dice rolls. Beautifully produced, everything just works perfectly. The action cards and event cards add the variability needed to make sure that each game plays out differently. Very neat mechanisms, good tactical options make for a great game and this has all of it.

Troyes brings dice to the heavyweight Euro genre with mixed results.  This is a thoughtful, comprehensive design with too much going on.  The card-based diversity is overbroad, and players prone to AP will be stalled by the myriad choices.  The luck of the dice is mitigated in so many ways to preserve strategic gameplay that they almost don't matter. I'd be happy with all of that if the game had a natural rhythm, but this is a very choppy experience.

This must be a post-Essen craze going on. The game is certainly fine, but not outstanding.

Pros:
- The artwork. Depending on how you look at it, it is just awesome. It is by no means modern, but it never tried to be. The illustrations come fasciatingly close to early medieval drawings and by doing so add to the theme.
- The odds of ever playing in the same constellation are close to none. You have 27 cards, 9 per category. And it's only three activity cards per category that make it into the game. Plus you have different events (although there's only eight in total - eight red ones to be precise. And in a 4-player game almost all of the yellow aand white event cards will enter the game) From replayability point of view it reminded me of Agricola
- there's quite a lot to bear in mind when taking your actions and quite a lot of actions you can take. But this leads me to the first con ...  

Cons:
- actually it feels like the most meaningful decision you take is the first action of the round with all or many dice still available. Every action after feels like a rather obvious choice. Even more so in later rounds when lots of activity cards are already claimed and the dice for other activity cards are not around (or not enough to activate the card even once) I heard the phrase "Oh, what a surprise" quite often yesterday. So with your first action being that crucial, there's tons of one thing. Which is AP, AP and again AP! And you cannot really make plans unless you know what your opponent does. 
- Every game has a predefined phase order, but this one comes across even more repetitve. Roll your dice, fight the war, take actions, roll your dice, fight the war, take actions...I know that point is kind of unfair, but for me the whole game lacks excitement. 
- It feels very static. 

In conclusion I still enjoyed playing this. It's certainly not a bad game, but I guess that every Spiel' needs an underdog that can be glorified afterwards.

Took a long time to actually learn just by reading the rulebook, but turns out it's a good game. The variety is nice, and each player having a secret end-game scoring condition that actually scores for every player is really cool.

My main issue is that even though the dice have multiple uses and there are different ways to manipulate them, rolling high will give you an advantage. So if a player has exceptional luck, they'll be more likely to win.

We played this for the first time last night and we totally botched the rules.  
That being said I went home and played this on BGA to get a better handle of the rules.  I will rank this with Power Grid right now, I definately need to learn the cards and build a better strategy as I've been losing badly on BGA but the complexity and depth of this game is great.  Additionally the variety of cards that will come up each game is ever changing.
This will be a staple of game night for the next 4 or 5 weeks as we really learn the finer aspects of the game and work on 'trying' to master it.  
Beautiful mechanics that are not typical of any Euro that we've played.  A strong 'Screw the next player' element is built in, whether intentional or not.  

I plan on writting a review when I have a better grasp of the game.

RATING: 8
Where to begin... I like how the three factions (Religion, Merchants, Soldiers) and their corresponding actions are new each game, which would keep the game fresh.

I don't like that its centered around dice. Too many times I was going last (4er) and all the good dice were stolen by the time I finally got a turn. Maybe this game would be better with just 2 players which would allow you to leverage the dice changing abilities more, but honestly I just don't see myself getting excited for this game any time soon. There are just better games with 2 players (Le Havre, Twilight Struggle) that I would enjoy so much more or 4 players (Caylus, Tzolkin)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I give it an 8 after the first play because I can see so much depth to it. Our first play was a bit more difficult than I thought it would be. After reading the rules, I was sure it would be fairly straight forward--which is another way of saying the rules are VERY well written. I suspect my rating will go up with more plays and the gameplay becomes more fluid. I think this will eventually be in my top 10.

UPDATE: I had such a wonderful experience with Troyes recently that I a had to come make a comment. What I learned is how different one game can be from the next. We played two games. In the first, we had no problems eliminating the event cards--wam bam! They would appear and disappear, not effecting the game much at all. In the second game, it was a different story. Neutrals meeps were pouncing on all city-building positions, and attack cards were all showing double dice and lots of flags to cover up. The game felt like a co-operative fight against the outside events. Every player at the table commented how different the two games were. I think it's refreshing to find a game that offers a legitimate differing experience when so many games offer superficial replayability. What Troyes offers for replayability is NOT superficial.

RATING: 8
I love the complexity of this game and the richness in options available, but there was a sense that there may be too many options that are intermingled. It is very difficult to tie the pieces together in a way that makes sense to form a solid strategy for the game. This may change with additional plays, but at the moment it feels like it's more of a random element than anything else. I very much enjoy playing, but this game is very difficult to teach. On further plays I may change my rating one way or another depending on whether I feel like things start to click or if it just continues to feel chaotic.

Quite possibly the least random dice game ever. If anything the Activity cards create more randomness than the dice. Great tactical game at 3. Gets a bit chaotic at 4. The 2er can be fairly strategic but is more prone to being won or lost by the activity cards that come out.

RATING: 7.5
I really love the look of this game, maybe even more than I like the game itself.

It's a solid Euro and every game will present you with a very unique setup.

I wish the 2 player game was longer than 4 rounds, that feels too short.

While thematically all the actions make very good sense, you will still feel quite detached from the theme.

Some iconography is pretty cryptic sometimes and still doesn't make sense after 15 plays.

I wish there was a score pad for the end of the game because paying out everyone with the one-sided VP chips is a clunky pain in the ass.

RATING: 9
This game is very interesting. I feel like there's a lot of potential for variation in how the game plays out depending on which action cards come out. I like the mechanics of using other people's dice to form sets and paying influence in order to modify your own dice. I don't feel like anything is under-priced. Often-times you'll want to take the best possible action, but it will cost you more than you may be willing to pay and it will make you think twice. I do feel like the game might be effected slightly by turn order. I've only played it twice, however (and both times last in turn order), so that worry might be unfounded.

There's a lot going on in Troyes.

The game goes out of its way to introduce player interaction, which is very welcome in the world of mid-weight Euros. The Character and Action cards offer a ton of variability and the fact that not all of the available actions are known during the first several rounds forces played to alter their strategy - not just tactical decisions - mid-game.

The decision space is fairly tight, but there's nearly always a good move for each die you have in your possession. It's a matter of deciding if you should use those dice NOW, or steal something to help yourself and throw off an opponent first (and hope that your play is still available later in the round).

A game that "feels" very novel - it seems difficult to sum up its mechanics in a simple and concise way.  This is probably a good thing overall, although it makes teaching the game slightly more difficult.  It may also suffer from significant imbalance in player seating order, or so it has appeared to us in the last couple of games.

RATING: 3.5
First Impression: 
It's a euro attempt gone wrong. 

1. Your starting setup can really hurt you and you have 0 information to help you decide better and not enough time to succesfully change strategy once the game starts. And of course that's all because the cards (randomly picked) are unbalanced. (hello archer) 

2. Too much luck for a euro. This game has both dice and randomly drawn cards. Dice results can be used in various ways but still there are good throws, and bad throws. And since you'll throw your dice only 5 times per game, + perhaps a few times more if you pay, or if some other random mechanic kicks in... it's just not enough to balance the luck. Risk is less luck dependent than this game.

All in all the game is dissapointing. Once it's initial freshness wears off, I'm pretty sure it'll find it's way down where it belongs. (edit:I guess I was wrong about that)

6 plays in and the strategic side is slowly coming about.  Being able to pounce on a round 3 action as its revealed seems to be pretty important.  Knowing which ones are available, and which preceding actions feed into the most possible round 3 point scorers is key.  Sometimes you just get lucky with the set up, but learning which early round feed into the late round is what I'm going to focus on plays 6-10.

I started off rating this only at a 7 and that was good with the initial game. It was taught kind of poorly and well honestly some of the event cards that came up made the game difficult. Now that I own it though and have played it a few more times I'm happy having moved it's rating not once to 8 but then again a second time to a 9. I just keep thinking about playing this game again and that's a good thing to me. The event cards and the building cards make such a huge difference in how the game gets played each time. This game is brilliant. 

Now with the expansion I can say that I feel this is even better at 2 players than ever before and that's saying something. What a cool game.

Nice new mechanics and a great twist on worker placement with the addition of dice. It has certain advantages over Caylus ("buildings" are limited each time and common to everyone), but there are some real killer combos that new players will not recognize what is happening until close to the end of the game. Great game that is highly recommended.

Judging by the rulebook and the artwork, I expected this game to be dry and complex. During my first game with two, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The rules fell into place after the first turn, and the gameplay felt sort of relaxed and full of interesting decisions. Sure, it is yet another dice allocation/worker placement game, but one that feels original and fresh due to the common threats that players have to contend with, the ability to purchase dice from other players and the combination of action cards that is different each game. The iconography used on the board and on the cards is consistent and therefore easy to understand. Also, the game is less about strategy and planning ahead, and more about making the best of what is given to you each turn. It feels like it is unlikely to be shut out from victory after a less than optimal turn. And it all works very well with just two players! One of the few gamers' games that my girlfriend really likes. It has the same feel as The Castles Of Burgund, and I love it to the same degree.

I love the dice mechanic. Excellent re-playability due to the different activity-card combinations. Good balance between strategy and tactics. Event combat is interesting: cooperative at times, confrontational at other times. The character cards are good (with some character cards you can hide your intentions until the last round when the others will find it difficult to respond).

A player count of 3 is optimal (ideal balance between strategic and tactical). The 2-player count is very good too. The 4-player count is a bit too tactical for may taste.

I even find that the game's theme works well. A 10 after my 13th play.

fun; can be vicious in that the dice that you are rolling can be swiped by opponents at times, making it harder for you to do what you need to do, but you can swipe theirs - only catch is the cost that needs to paid which can be expensive;  this game can be unforgiving the odd time if the strategy that you are building upon gets bunged up by random card flip effects of event cards which you have no choice but to fight at times - thereby relieving your precious dice pool of those dice that you really need for resources; still a fun challenging game

RATING: 10
I adore this game. It definitely takes new players some time to catch on to the symbols, flow, and strategy in this game, but I think it's so worth learning. Each game is very different due to the card combinations on the board. Aside from Tournay, I've not seen a similar mechanic of dice buying that helps to mitigate poor rolls. It's a very clever design! The only drawbacks are a fairly long play time with 4 players, and a advantage/disadvantage depending on how many times you're the start player in a game.

RATING: 6
Relatively heavy euro worker placement game that uses dice as workers and mitigates luck elements with clever mechanisms that allow use of other player's dice. Typical of a euro, the game presents an engine by which actions can be taken to convert various assets (in Troyes, this is namely money, influence and citizens) into victory points. There's some variation in the cards and secret-identity roles present from game to game which provides variability in game play. 

Although, I find the game incredibly original, gameplay felt relatively fiddly and overlong. Along with the original game play comes the fact that it's somewhat non-intuitive so an actual play round may be needed to teach the game even to seasoned gamers. All this meaning that first plays will likely be much longer than the 90 minutes that are advertised. This is a game that therefore needs a commitment of multiple plays from a group of players - for me however, I'm not certain I wish to commit to it over other heavy worker placement euros I find more compelling, such as Le Havre or Agricola. And when it comes to scratching the dice-worker-placement itch, I'm more compelled to Alien Frontier's straight forward and tense game play.  

I do absolutely love the graphic design and production is top notch.

Bottom line is Troyes is to be played again given the opportunity, but it's no big deal if that opportunity is not immediate.

[i]"Poor. Likely won't play this again although could be convinced."[/i]

Zero theme, it's numbers all the way down. There's no real arc to the game either beyond the addition of more powerful actions, players never really own anything so it's 5 resources cycling around while occasionally producing a VP.

Planning is next to impossible - there's not even a turn's notice of which cards are coming up, you select your initial dice colours with NO information at all, and if you aren't first it's a crapshoot which dice will be available to you anyway. VPs are hidden but trackable, and the hidden character cards apply to everyone with arbitrary cutoffs.

Overall this game includes so many basic design mistakes I must wonder if I'm missing something, because I don't understand its BGG ranking at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The turn order problem in Troyes  is ridiculous. Even if the game "balances" as some on BGG claim (the argument is that the first players lose some dice via fighting which compensates for the benefit of starting twice) the phenomenological experience is deeply and quite negatively impacted. Playing in the third and worse the fourth position is just a lot less fun. Sure, maybe you have the same chance at victory (who knows, but this is what the defenders claim) but getting the dregs of the left over dice reduces your options, and options are what make a game enjoyable. Troyes is a game that made me rethink what I expect when I think about game balance: it can't just be about an equal crack at the most victory points. Balance really needs to include the notion that all the players having an equally compelling and enjoyable experience. This makes Troyes my first game with a different rating based on my own personal turn position per game: If I am first or second in turn order, Troyes is an 8. 3rd or 4th and I'd give it a 4. It really is too bad that the turn order issue is what is, and seems especially bizarre given the evolution of modern game design.

There's a lot to like here.  However, the game is also excessively complicated in some areas - pruning down some of the mechanics would make this game cleaner, easier to learn, and a better experience overall.  (E.g., the character cards each player gets feel extremely tacked on and don't add enough to the game to be worth their inclusion.)

Troyes is probably my favorite game, next to possibly Le Havre.  The art in Troyes is fantastic, easily my favorite art of any game, and the game is very engaging.  My only real complaint is that many of the mechanics are quite abstract compared to the theme of the game.  In other words, very little of what you do in the game actually feels anything like the description of those actions.  Hence I'd label it as an abstract worker placement game, despite the thematic looking artwork.

RATING: 10
Post-essen rating based on almost a full game... But I am already in love. It was my most awaited game there, and it completely lived up to my expectations.

Just re-read the rules, fairly confident it will stay as a ver rich, interactive, innovative game. For a first time for Pearl Gmaes and 2 co-authors, its amazing. For X.Georges, he is really fullfilling Carson city shown me (note that a part for the richness and interactivity, there are few other similarity in the mechanics of the 2 games) . A group of designers to follow most probably, for me it's for sure. Congratulations guys, it is deserved.

Update after 5 plays. It's a 10 in my book. I thought the game was a little too convoluated, but after 3 plays, everything is in place, and it's a 4p, 2h experience of pure gaming... And the game is changing each time, depending on events mostly, but also with cards... Really impressed. Now I need to dig the 2p game, which I also suspect (based on a vassal game) to be truely good.

EDIT: 2player is even better. Wow....

I like euros that use dice in innovative ways like Kingsburg and Macao, so that's why I was initially attracted to this. It's neat to be able to build up a group of different dice in the various colours, yet be able to buy dice from your opponents should you need a different colour or rolled low.

It surprised me a little how well this did at Essen, I wasn't expecting that, as the buzz seemed low beforehand.

The dice management is excellent in this game, the single little flaw in my opinion is the lack of the possibility to combo your "stored" actions. For the first games we did that wrong and building a well tuned engine was possible and a valid strategy but we re-read the rules and saw that it isn't allowed. I know you could houserule it but I am not a fan of that.

I raised my rating to a 9. I think 3 player may be even better as you have less knowledge of the character cards.

For this reason, it will never compare with games like Terra Mystica or Caverna, which make thematic sense and have 'purpose' (terraforming and civ building/creating a farm/mine)...

Good dice-driven worker placement game. "Caylus: The Dice Game". Alien Frontiers is to Troyes as Carson City is to Caylus. Simpler, faster, more interactive, more FUN. Personally, I prefer Alien Frontiers but others will prefer Troyes as the more SERIOUS game. Completely different games and no reason not to get both Troyes and Alien Frontiers (as well as Kingsburg) if you like dice-driven worker placement games.

Not a big fan of dice placement games. Also, this game is MEAN, which I don't mind actually. Even though the rules for this game were muddled on first play and I spent a third of it not clear on what was happening, my first impression is that it's a straightforward worker placement game where your workers are dice and the various areas of the board/end goals give you points. Castles of Burgundy is the same concept but scoring points is more interesting by comparison, and I don't even like that game. The way Troyes differs is that you can't directly screw your opponents (ie buy their dice, kick them out of various regions on the map etc) but still, not enough to make this one interesting or exciting.

Light years better than other "dice management" games such as Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers, or Yspahan. There is just so much going on in a given turn of Troyes- in order to be successful you must not only be mindful of your own options but also those of your opponents; the varied presence of powerful combos only exacerbates this tension. Absolutely fun and meaty game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
To call Troyes a dice game is probably a disservice to the game, since it's really a thinky sort of strategy game that just uses dice as a primary mechanism.  It has a lot less luck than one would expect when hearing that the game uses a lot of dice, and the game has enough of an engine-building characteristic to allow players to work toward a grand move around the end of the game.  There's still a significant enough amount of chaos from the way that other players can buy your dice out from under you (the jury's still out if that's a bad or terrible part of the game), but most of the game can be predicted enough to where you won't be shut out of the game because of it.

The game seems a little dry and forced, but I can't deny that it works pretty well.  It just makes me wonder if, over time, I will ultimately just forget about the game, since it doesn't have the same sort of excitement factor that I enjoy when playing games.  We'll just have to see.

The art is amazing, and the gameplay is incredibly fun. The most interactive euro I know, with plenty of chances to screw up your competitors... at a cost. Amazing use of dice, with very low luck, and lots of tactical decisions every turn. High replayability and even higher with the expansion. Lovely, lovely game. Long live Troyes.

RATING: 7.5
Initially put off by the art and the fact that dice were involved, but after a few tries on BGA (Board Game Arena,) I have a more favourable view towards it. 

Bad dice rolls can be mitigated by careful management of resources such as influence and gold. It is possible to have your strategy to be hosed down by bad rolls but I do not view this any more differently then when someone deliberately blocks your move in other types of games.

I still feel that the 1st player has a distinct advantage but so far it feels that the game has a way of balancing it out, although some might feel this is dependent on the dice rolls.

Some feel that low numbers on dice hamper you but I feel that there are other things you can use the dice for like the placement of meeples on buildings to knock out an opponents piece to strengthen your position in the next round. Also, remember that the higher you roll while is good for you may also result in attracting your opponents and they will buy the dice from you to block you while improving their status. Granted you do get some renumeration but it usually cannot compare with the actions that can be done on the event or activity cards.

The events in the cards and activities feel, to me, quite thematic, but I can understand how other people may feel like its another dry, soulless euro with a medieval theme and cubes. 

The major complaint I have is that I fell that the game length may be a bit short and ends when you are about to chain your decisions together, preventing satisfying combos.

In Troyes, recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France. Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city: religious, military, and civil. Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them — anything for more fame!

One of my all time favourite games! Troyes is just so clever in how everything is folded together. Some may find it purely mechanical but the systems are easy to understand, and once you do, the theme and hilarious humour emerge from the sometimes oh-so-subtle cards and actions. Love it, love it, love it!

Been playing online with buddies now, too, and the game keeps getting better.  Theme's not heavy, but what theme there is fuses nicely with the mechanics.  The many options for the dice workers allows for regular nasty play and as the worker pool dries up, gets nastier still.  Like the speedy pace of the two player game, but the much more constricting three player game is also great fun.  Great game with great depth.

2017-09-23:  [bgcolor=#66FF99][s][color=#66FF99]-[/color][/s][b]8[/b][s][color=#66FF99]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor]  Okay, after a few more plays I've finally sussed the activity cards and very much enjoy this game and bumped up the rating.  Took me a while since there are a number of activity cards many of which have very unintuitive iconography.  The art throughout (box, board, cards) is lovely and what drew me to the game in the first place.  Playing with a work force of dice is a fun challenge with many options; options that differ from game to game.  Hoping for a heavy rotation of this.

2016-10-18:  [bgcolor=#9999FF][s][color=#9999FF]-[/color][/s][b]6[/b][s][color=#9999FF]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor]  Very mixed feelings about this game.  I enjoy creating the workforce, the workforce market, and fighting off the attacks on the city, but do not enjoy working out activity card combos.  I generally enjoy creating combos in other games, but perhaps it is the obscure iconography that turns me off.  Or perhaps because it is the most euroish angle to an otherwise very player interactive game.  Another play or two could alter my opinion either way.

That's it, I've become addicted to Troyes.  Extraordinary, one of a kind game with fantastic artwork and superb dice allocation mechanics. A masterpiece among modern euro games and one of my personal favourites. 

A word of warning though - this is a "gamer's game" and it's definitely not for everyone. New players might be having problems with deciding what to do during their turns - the path to victory is not obvious and finding an effective strategy among all the available choices can be really challenging.

Too many options to be optimized for my tastes.  Roll your dice, and then you use dice to convert flags into money, or money into VP, or change dice colors, or convert money into flags, or flags into VP, and so on and so on and so on.  Also very prone to AP near the end of the game as everything can screech to a grinding halt.

The box cover for some undentified reason has always put me off from seeking information about this game.  But I can genuinely say 'never judge a game by it's cover'! The board looks great, muted colours fitting with the theme. Mind you the theme does not shine through in the game play but it doesn't matter cos it is an excellent game.  Love the use of dice to select/manage your actions. Maybe worth a 10 in my book so may rerate after another play.

this game is farraginous, with lengthy rules, no theme, no involvment.

some rules are such that a single player is over damaged without any apparent fault. there's of course quite a bit of luck but then there is this almost non-sense of dice that you can buy from others, just ruining their placement of workers at the begninning.

Spelers moeten dobbelstenen gooien naar gelang ze posities hebben in de machtsgebouwen. Deze dobbelstenen kunnen ze dan weer gebruiken om acties te doen. De spelers kunnen echter ook goede dobbelstenen kopen bij de tegenstanders en hierdoor hun eigen acties versterken en die van de tegestanders verzwakken.

The path to victory:  As early in the game as possible, identify one of the degenerate card combinations on the board and run in endless victory point circles until the game ends.

In my case, starting on round 2 or 3, I literally repeated the same two or three dice actions over and over again until I won, which was fun for absolutely no one at the table.  Moreover, others did exactly the same thing; it just happened that my broken VP combo was a tiny bit better than theirs, as were the hidden endgame VP goals that I lucked into accomplishing.

I'd sooner cut out my tongue than ask to play this again.

So, it's essentially themeless, which is usually a big negative for me, but for some reason I liked this one pretty well.  I think it's because the dice add in enough uncertainty to keep things interesting.  You have several options, but not so many that it's overwhelming.  Players can affect each other, but not overly much.  The game moved right along and it's only 5 turns long.  It's quite tactical because even though you are in some sense building up for the big scoring opportunities at the end, you don't know what they're going to be until the game is half over.  If I remember right, the score was something like 43-43-41, but I don't remember who was tied for the win.  Maybe that's a bad sign, but I enjoyed the game while it was going on and I'd play it again.

My second most anticipated game prior to Essen 2010 (first was [gameid=68448]). Happy to say it met my expectations. Troyes features clever use of dice, lots of ways to score points and several different victory paths to consider. There's plenty of variability in which cards will appear each game. It also has hidden goal cards, which I've recently realised is one of my favourite game mechanics, but here they affect all players, bringing in an element of bluffing.

Poster child for games that get better with repeated plays. Second play went much smoother than first, down to about 90 minutes for 3-players.

Takes dice allocation and worker placement to another level. Very interesting and a pretty good brain burner. AP might be somewhat of an issue here. Find the building combos and hit them until the VP machine dies. Use of neutral dice also allow some wiggle room for actions.

RATING: 8
It was a lot of fun, but I get the impression that it's a game that's almost always going to be very close... between its hyper-balanced Euro nature and the ability to hurt the leader, the only way the game won't be decided on the last turn is if someone isn't really paying attention to the score and is inadvertently kingmaking by hurting the second-place player instead.

In those sorts of games, it's hard to feel like the rest of the game has any significance; someone has an advantage coming into the last turn, perhaps, but someone different would have had one if the game had ended one turn earlier or later.

Hiding the victory chips is the same "solution" to this employed by Small World, but it's a dodge, not a solution, since it relies on players being lazy and not simply counting the points their opponents are earning. The hidden objectives don't help much, as it seems pretty easy to obtain one's six bonus points, since no two players are ever competing for the same thing.

very low key worker placement...you take actions by dividing dice rolls by a number to get an amount of "uses" of that action (a tinge of Stone Age there)...the only resources are money, workers and influence...took 3 games to get all the rules right!...the decisions are very interesting...at first it seems opaque, but then it opens up to some interesting strategies...love it!

Complex game with high replayability. Plays pretty fast with non-AP players. Some cards are maybe too complex, might take time to learn them.

I'm a fan of Xavier Georges, but this is just not for me. I don't like the hidden goals, and the randomness. Oddly enough I love the look though.

Troyes is my current overall favorite game and I don't see myself replacing it anytime soon. 

Pros:
*Mix of tactical and strategic game play that rewards flexible planning
*Gives you a depth of options that never seem "samey"
*Interactivity between players that feels like it matters without feeling mean or forced

Cons:
*Must be able to do math in your head or feels like homework
*Lack of variety in event cards

Mechanism are interesting but not that innovative. There are lots of decisions and a game is not that random as you could think in a dice game. Still didn't get me

6/8/2014: did first learning play through, watched a few videos too, so I think we're set for the 1st real play through. I think I've got an idea of 'what' I'm trying to do now at least but learning the best way to use the Activity cards which happen to be available will definitely take some time.

The rule book has the Priest card image but the explanation is for the Merchant card, so that kind of threw me off for a bit. lame... doesn't anyone proof anything?

Another medieval worker placement game!

Scoops up all that's good from Alien Frontiers, and then dumps that in the [i]poubelle[/i], leaving you with an oh so slow dice-manipulation game.

Here's what it does have:

Hundred spinning Palissy plates. Check.
Obscure French naming of cards. Check.
Half-arsed icons. Check.
DRY gameplay. Grave dust dry. Gameplay so dry you'd better have a glass of Champagne handy. Check.
Vague theme. Check.
Many befuddling options. Check.
Dull board (not as dull as Conquest of Planet Earth, but pretty dull). Check.

Choosing what to do on your turns becomes angst-ridden, especially as everyone's victory points are kept secret from everyone else - resulting in 2 hours where no one is aware of the score, and no one feels particularly knowledgeable as to the best course of action to enable a win, and that's a large demerit. I can see clearly why the game doesn't have open scoring: analysis paralysis and number crunching, dragging the end game into infinity, but it still doesn't make me respect Troyes in the morning.

The game does have a couple of nice ideas, but they're hidden under a dusty old, moth-eaten medieval tapestry.

In the end, Troyes was not my cup of mead.

This is a Euro Gamer's Euro game for sure.  The artwork is pleasant enough, but the opaqueness of the symbology and abstractness of the goals coupled with hard to read board positions make this feel more like a solo point maximization exercise than I expected (though certainly the dice your opponents use effect your plans regularly thorughout the game).  Really the first game I've played that felt like a collection of mechanics with no thematic feel.  I still really liked the game, but I doubt the "changing dice pips into points" game would see enough play in my group to be worth getting.

Normally I like games with lots of decisions and alternate paths for victory, but it not easy to look at the board and see what your options were.  This caused the game to drag on a bit more than desired as each player had to review all the cards on the board.  Your ability to plan for victory points was also limited since you do not know which cards are in plays.  If the game did not have so much downtime, I'd probably give it an 8.  Maybe it will improve with more plays.  Stay away from AP-prone players.

I didn't think I liked games with dice-rolling but this completely changed my mind. It rocketed to the top of my list after the first play through. I love the interesting decisions to be made each and every turn.

EDIT: Rating increased to my first 10. After almost 20 plays this is still so engaging. The dice manipulation is so clever and I'm still discovering ways to create interesting combos. It's easily a 10 on its own; the expansion simply confirms it.

Excellent, and delightfully unusual.  You know, this is the way to use dice.  This game is more of a brain-burner than you'd guess, because the way you hire people to get you dice, that get rolled, then used or hired out to secure positions of power, combat awful events, or otherwise wrangle for VP.  I wasn't completely sure how forcibly hiring each others' workforces (dice) away from each other would work out; although it does shift play a little toward the tactical end of the spectrum, there is still plenty of strategy to employ.  It can be a little challenging to think your way through the complexities of playing well, which is a wonderful thing.

After 1 Play: I'm definitely going to give this one at least one more try.  I had a few concerns with some of the mechanics in the first game, but I won't have a clearer idea until I play again.

Superb artwork on the cards that fits the theme. Easy to understand rules and good mechanisms. Very balanced. One of the best eurogames I played. It uses dice but there really is almost no luck in it. It does look a little bit dry with its gray board and that has turned people off, but when playing it you discover a solid well crafted game. 
I enjoy the different combo's that come out each game. The black cards that attack the town also make each game slightly different. 
What I miss is a little bit more interaction. You can push away meeples and buy up dice from other players, but still it feels a little bit like multiplayer solitaire. 
There is some AP because you don't know exactly which dice will still be available when it's your turn.

With two players, it worked for me.
With four players, there are a couple problems:
a) downtime - you can not plan your move ahead because it depends on the available dice, and they can change a lot
b) catchup - if you fall behind on dice and/or roll badly, you're lost
Not quite clear to me why so many people seem to like it so much.

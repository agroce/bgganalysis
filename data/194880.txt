1st play: Very simple game to play with the kids with a cute theme and great art.  Played a practice game with the wife and there are some interesting but not very deep choices.  Also, it's very short, which is an asset when playing with kids.

2nd play: Probably really best for younger kids, my 8 year old liked it, the 10 year old was bored.  It's a cute theme and probably ideal for 5-8 year olds.

A light, card drafting, set collecting family style gateway game, Dream Home is an absolute delight.  

Each player collects two on their turn and places them on their personal (house) player board.  Conjoining certain rooms will garner more points, but in doing so you limit other possible rooms and scoring opportunities.  Use the various tool/helper cards to swap rooms, and generally mix-up the normal rules.  

Turns are quick with nice drafting decisions, as is placement of the rooms, roof tiles and decor items,  The artwork throughout is drop dead gorgeous with each card bright, colourful and beautifully illustrated, matching player boards solid components show great attention to detail - even the box insert is shaped like a house.  

A quick, simple, very accessible, family game for 2-4 players that is easily done in 30 minutes.

Dream Home is a quick fun filler for gamers, and, with its simple rules and friendly theme, is a perfect gateway game for kids and non-gamers.

It is a drafting game where cards are pick up from a display. The rules for scoring (a bit hard for new gamers, but I had success in explaining them "on the fly" to my 7 and 5 years old daughters... so they're not so difficult!) make the choices not easy and quite interesting!

Definitely a good game!

Mooie kleurrijke kaarten die ook kinderen aantrekken.
Je legt de kaarten strategisch in je huis, waarbij je probeert aan een aantal verschillende criteria te voldoen.  Uitdagend voor 8-10 jarigen, denk ik.
Geluksfactor?  De volgorde van de kaarten op het bord.
Minus voor kids?  Punten worden pas op het einde gescoord; tussentijds weet je niet of je goed bezig bent.
Onvoldoende om te kopen; zeker voldoende om af en toe te spelen.
Dat zegt ook Himaya :-)

Let op: Inrichtingen kan je enkel nemen als je ze meteen kan afleggen.  Als je dat doet, dan kan je de kamer ook niet meer vergroten.

The art and presentation and idea of this game are nice and interesting. I found the game play to be severely lacking. Especially in a 4 player game, my choices are so miniscule and uninteresting that I was not excited by the experience. Some of the tool cards make it kind of interesting, but not enough for me to want to play it more. Even for non-gamers, I found it almost too dull. The tie-breaker was the best part of the game where players find kids hiding in their rooms. Otherwise, I just wasn't impressed.

More of a "family" game for sure, but I actually found it to be a fun filler.  The art / graphic design is phenomenal, which makes the game super easy to teach, and the game looks inviting enough that people are not gamers will probably even jump in.  Not sure I would play this outside of with my family, but I did have fun with this one.  Seems to also scale pretty well too.  Wish there was more cards though, and more than just the order of the cards changed every found.

Cute. It has 'family game' plastered all over it. It's basically action choosing and set collection with a very playful Disney-like design. You learn it in five minutes and it shouldn't take more than half an hour per play. It will probably get stale pretty fast, but it isn't targeted at serious gamers and that makes me biased I guess. Since it's card-based I can see expansions coming out for it.

In some ways it reminds me of Kanagawa, but without the same depth of play.

Dream Home is a light filler when played with adults, and does a nice job of being playable with both kids and adults.  Regardless of who you play with, this is not a deep or tight game - it's 12 rounds of picking 1 of the available 2 card combinations that are randomly dealt to the board.  Each pair of cards consists of a room card and a booster card, with the exception of the first room card dealt - it comes with the privilege of becoming first player in the next round in lieu of a booster card.  There are only a few scoring considerations, and the rooms are all fairly balanced, so scores will be close.  I expect that how the cards come out will dictate the game in most cases when played competitively - which is a great reason to relax and just build the best house you can with what you get.

Juego muy sencillito y familiar. Durante varias rondas, sale una parrilla de cartas emparejadas en dos filas. Una fila contiene habitaciones, y la otra contiene tejados, personajes, o items de decoración. El turno de un jugador consiste simplemente en escoger una pareja y ubicarla en su casa, siguiendo unas sencillas reglas de construcción.
Las habitaciones dan puntos según las cartas adyacentes. Además, se pueden añadir decoraciones y demás. Al final, además, se puntúa los tejados  y bueno, el final de la partida es una casa muy bonita. LAs cartas son una preciosidad y son TODAS diferentes. Un alarde de diseño e ilustración. Muy sencillo y resultón. Recomendable para no jugones.

Dream Home is a super cute game that lends itself well to play by more casual gamers, or gamers with children. However, I just didn't feel like there was enough here that was all that interesting to me personally. The goals of the game are rather boring, and the card drafting mechanism isn't very interesting.

I really do think it's a good game for the target audience (families) tough, and it would be something I'd definitely give as a gift.

Hard to believe, but we played this 3 times in a little over an hour. What a great filler game that I bet my wife would be willing to play as well. It's light card drafting and set collection with only a few simple rules that make sense so it's really easy to pick up and play. You will use all of the cards in the game which I know will turn off some, but I don't think that will hinder my enjoyment as the houses do look different and you can laugh about your different setups each time. The tiebreaker is also fun, count the number of kids in your house. Great filler game, highly recommend!

This is an immensely cute little family game. I enjoy playing it with adults and the theme is fun and gameplay can be modified in ways to accommodate even younger players. I have been able to play loosely with my four year old son. It has kind of a "point salad" type of scoring system that is good preparation before introducing a 7 wonders type of game later on. Even though I described it as a gateway or younger kid game, it definitely has enough heft to play well with even slightly more experienced groups. I love the player boards, I love the artwork, and the fun of building a house with fun rooms. We've had fun with the kids laughing about our cool house with game rooms, libraries, and no bathroom or kitchen, etc. Also, I love love the tie-breaker searching through the rooms to find kids in the house, while rarely used it is very clever.

Fun and very fast and accessible family game. Wonderful artwork, and every single card having unique artwork is a very nice touch. Drafting pairs of cards as opposed to one at a time is an interesting twist, and the discard rule for lower player counts keeps the tension up. While I do wonder how replayability will hold up over time I will say this game has become a staple family game in my collection.

Quick, pleasant drafting game. The spatial considerations and paired-item draft really make the game; otherwise it'd be far too calculable. The art is nicely entertaining, with nice details.

RATING: 7
Components: Superb artwork, differentiating even the rooms of a similar theme, with all sorts of fun details. Solid cardboard decor tokens.

Experience: I'm surprised at the low age requirement on this game, as the helper cards are wordy and tricky; and the scoring is a traditional Euro-style point salad, which is tough for a kid to prepare for on the first playing.

I enjoy this game on its own merits, not just in the context of playing with kids. I like the choices of how to prioritize obtaining rooms, and leaving space for expanding existing rooms. I like the Room + Roof/Helper pairings to make those decisions even harder. I like looking around the table to anticipate how my opponent's will value the different pairings.

Game is problematic in that if the lower level cards don't surface until later in the game, or if only one player gets one, the other players can be forced to waste that space.

Base game has really low replay value and not much depth. I was lured by the expansion promises that it will cure the repetitiveness, but it left me disapointed. The new cards are for 5/6 players games (my group is max 4), the solo mode is dull, the only "+" are the mini-expansions that are included - "Family and Friends" and "Construction Plans" - they add a little depth and tactical thinking to the game.  it still too low for my and my friends taste, even as a filler,and it hasn't hit the table since first game. Good game to play with kids and to introduce people to board games, but nothing more. The rating is for base game and "Sunny street 156 expansion" combined.

If you imagine Sushi-Go and put it on a grid...  that's basically Dream Home.   Here, you are drafting paired-up combos of cards, and there is a light spatial element.   The presentation is good, and the theme is appealing.  It plays quickly, but I don't see more than handful of plays in this box.

This game is exactly what I wanted when it was purchased. A quick, easy, and fun family style game. There are some decision that can be made for deeper gameplay. Art (interesting and fun) and components are well done. However I HATE when the main cards of a game are the mini cards. I understand why they are used though. My houses can have a game room, library, and hot tub sign me up. The best thing about this game is that almost everyday since my daughter got it 2 weeks ago she asks about playing it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After 1 Play: Looks nice, easy to teach, easy to learn, has some spacial elements...but it feels like its just missing something to make it special. Still happy to play it.

After 5 Plays: The game gives you enough time to complete the things you need to complete, which means the game is pretty tight and can come down to a few misplays or being beat to a certain room. It's still not an extremely deep game, but after 5 plays I still like playing it and have fun trying different combos. I kind of wish the room placement wasn't so limiting though.

After 10 Plays: PENDING

While it's a very nice family game with a fitting theme, it's way to light for me. All you do is taking 2 cards you may need or not and put them into your house. If you put them in the right spots, you gain more points and that's it (+ a few action cards).

This is a real family game that delights our kids simply for its artwork - after we were done, they kept building their dream homes (and, unavoidably, fighting for the best rooms). With the exception of some of the special cards, this is quick to explain and straight-forward enough (you can explain the special cards as they appear).

This game is best when played with people who enjoy talking about their homes at the end of the game. Before we score any of the homes, we have each player describe their home as if they are a real estate agent attempting to sell a potential buyer. This adds a lot to the experience and provides an opportunity for everyone to have some fun even if they don't end up winning.

Nagyon kellemes kis családi játék pofonegyszerű alapmechanikával. A szabályok alapján súrolja a gyerekjáték kategória tetejét, de azért kell annyi dologra figyelni, és egy kicsit számolgatni, hogy szórakoztató legyen a felnőttek számára is. A grafikák nagyon hangulatosak, gyakorlatilag minden szobakártyát érdemes kicsit jobban szemügyre venni, találunk mindenhol valami érdekességet. Szóval szép is, jó is, nem mondom, hogy gyakran vágynék rá, de fájni biztosan nem fáj, sőt, inkább tetszik.

Cute game for kids likely too light for most adults unless played as a filler. Does present a number of good decisions though and that combined with amazing artwork and a theme our 8 year old son loves makes it a keeper.  I despise memory elements too but have to laugh a little at anyone complaining about this one.  All you have to remember with the roof cards is a single color that you took first and are going for.  Maybe a second color if you want to be crafty. If you can't remember that much how do you play games with more than two rules?
Two different decks of cards are laid out in rows and you have to pick the right column that gives you both an advantageous room card along with a decent misc card which can be 1 of 4 different main types. Rarely are the two you most want in the same column so proper tension ensues.  Tools and helpers help change up the game as does bonus points for achieving certain objectives with roofing and home effectiveness.  Spatially a number of rules about what can go where and above what combined with when certain adjacent things score more give plenty of depth for families.  Well done overall.  Highly recommended for families.

Review after 1 Play - played 4P game with wife and two of our boys (9 and 4) and had a great time. The card drafting of a column of two cards is interesting. The theme of building a house with different rooms in it is perfect for young kids.  They want to keep playing so I will too. Didn't like how the first player to draft cards could be first player the entire game if they just focused on the rooms and not the resource cards. 

Review after 5 Plays - TBD

Very nice, family friendly card drafting game.  There are two types of cards, room cards and another card type.  You lay these out and draft sets of two cards.  There is one space that gives one card and start player.  You then layout your cards on your home.  There are three stories and the different rooms have bonuses when placed next to other rooms.  

Light simple game but very fun.  Scales ok, but not great at lower player counts since the first player can have a big advantage

I'd rate it higher, but I've played 6 games and I'm not sure how much replayability it will have.  I'm guessing by 20 games I'll be tired of it (of course, there's an expansion coming out next month, but still).  

Still though.  It's really fun.  I recommend it.

This is an excellent light-weight game of building up your dream home. The turns are really simple, you have the choice of a set of room cards that are paired up with something, either the start player marker, a tool card, helper card or roof card. You choose one of the available pair and add the room to your house. Tools and helpers give you one-time abilities or scoring options at the end of the game. At the end of the game you add the roof and tally up your points.

I haven't had the chance to play it with the family yet, but I'm certain it's going to be a hit.

Pleasant game of flushing out your house, placing rooms and decorative additions.  Each turn you choose a row and get one or two cards which you have to immediately use to fill your home.  Putting specific rooms net to each other scores extra points, as does certain arrangements.  Easily explained, a few special action cards.  Very tactical.  My son won our first game!

RATING: 10
This is an absolutely great family game. Most probably the best game for kids (4-10) I've ever played. What makes it great for kids: everything is open on the table which allows for strategy discussions on the fly without ruining the game, no things to be kept secret, no kid is left alone to decide. On the other hand, it is still enjoyable and not boring for adults. We took it on holidays with a 5-year-old, a not-yet-5, and an 8-year-old. The younger guys, after playing a couple of times teaming up with an adult, are now perfectly capable to play on their own. The graphics are lovely ("ha, look at this mess in your bedroom!"), the mechanics well thought. Kids are not even interested to count the points in the end, they are so happy with the dream homes they built ("ok, maybe you have more points, but I have a double kitchen with an ice-cream maker").

A great open-drafting game!
The Sims Gateway Game in a box.

Works really well with the family. 

To make it more family friendly it would be good to be able to replace the Utility Cards with text on it with a couple of simpler ones to make it even more light to play.
And on the same note it would be great to replace the other cards with more abilities to make the game more complex when playing with less new gamers.

And that artwork... Amazing! One of the best looking games out there!

Dream Home is a light and enjoyable gateway game that is likely to appeal to non-gamers due to its easy to grasp play and recognisable theme. 

The players are required to build rooms in their home and must do so by taking cards from a central marketplace. The trick here is that they must take the 1-2 cards in a single column so they come as a pair. The bottom row always features rooms whilst the top row features decorations, tools roof cards and characters such as interior decorators and the like. 

What drives the decision making is the scoring and points can be earned in several ways. Rooms are the key scoring mechanism and building larger rooms earns more points, provided the same room types are placed adjacent to one another. Throw in some building placement rules and you start to get the idea of what is on offer here. 

Overall I quite enjoyed this game and rate it a 7, which for me is the average game that is good to play but not all the time. The thing holding it back for me at present is that all of the cards are seen with every game and the same room cards will be seen regularly. Whilst the game will play different each time, I'm not sure if it will start to feel samey after 3-4 plays. 

That said I could enjoy this once or twice a month for the foreseeable future. I suspect this will stay as a 7 rating for me.

A simple family game, with a captivating and enjoyable graphics. The only thing I did not appreciate the mechanics of roofs. If you do not recognize the colors well, and \ or have problems with memory (like me), you can be a disadvantage in some games!

Very simple drafting game that works far better at a higher player count. If the cards draw right you can kind of right 'first choice' to victory, but it is not easy. Will be keeping this game mostly because my wife likes it. It may have replaced Ticket to Ride as her favourite game. It has replaced Sushi Go as her favourite drafting game!

I bought this primarily because my family loves them some HGTV (I love it too, who am I kidding). Anyway, this kinda appeals to their inner home decorator/floor plan designer.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]
This is an excellent next level game for my daughter Lilly. She is almost 7 and is not as keen on playing the ""kid's" games anymore so I've been looking for games that will introduce more advanced gaming concepts to her while also having a theme she would like if possible. At first I thought Dream Home would be too much for her, but really the only help she needed was reading the helper/tool cards, she picked up all the other concepts of the game just fine. 

Dream Home is a drafting and card placement game. The rules are easy to learn and teach and the game plays quick enough that I think a table of gamers would also enjoy this one. You are drafting two cards each turn so there is some decision making there and then you need to think about how to place the rooms in your home to maximize points and follow certain rules. Nothing about the game is complex, but there are enough decisions to make that the game play remains engaging for the duration. 

I'd highly recommend this for families and gamers that really enjoy those sub 45 minute games. The drafting is quite fun in this game and there are a lot of cards you can draft that will give you more control of the draft or room placement later on. Dream Home is a winner, I'm very happy I introduced this one to my family.[/i]

A fairly bland, luck-laced, set collecting game. The feature piece is that the draft is made up of pairs of cards - one half being a room for your house (and these come in the standard forms, earning more points by being placed in your house/tableau in the places you normally find those rooms), the other half being a roof, an action card, or a bonus point card. This pairing makes the choosing slightly harder as it's rare that the perfect pair you want comes along, and that it'll still there by the time it's your turn. Sometimes you get lucky, mostly you don't, and that's the nature of the game. Taking the best on offer and hoping for the best in future. Much like looking for a real house really.

Light family game. I like the art a lot but it's too light for my taste. It feels, in a two player game, that you take more time flipping new cards, than actually building your house.

Try Jan/17 - nice quick game, easy to learn.  I wish it had some slight variation to the room/tool mix from game to game by having a few extra cards, but that's just a nitpick.  Very nice components & functional summary card reminder (which lots of game fail to have).

美術強的沒話說，圖片裡還可以玩大家來找碴(小孩)XD，找小孩居然是突破平手的條件聽了就有趣起來。簡單的機制完美呈現家庭遊戲該有的規則長度，功能卡的講解反而佔比較多時間但基本上都還容易理解，選卡時大家可以一起觀看場上的卡片不會產生等待時間太久的情形讓遊戲可以順暢進行。
要說缺點的話就是對策略玩家可能覺得耐玩度稍嫌不足，因為一開始能放的卡片位置有限，而且基本上這遊戲沒有鼓勵專走某一門的路線，所以每場大多是要朝面面俱到去完成導致遊戲體驗都會相似

This is a good kids game for those who have a sense of what they want their dream home to look like later in life. Interesting combinations can be created with bonus cards, the game does feel a little bit anticlimatical at the end, and it does come round quite quick with four players. Definitely one that could improve with the right expansion. Best score so far 48.light but fun, looks very pretty, could do with people.We Discovered that the first player token does not punish or penalize a player who repeatedly uses this option on all other turns which are allowed.

Disclaimer: rated as a kids game.
We're having so much fun with this! Very simple eurogame about furnishing your new home. Gameplay is straightforward (pick a column of two cards: a room and a roof/tool/worker; place the room in an empty spot of your house [following few simple rules] and use the tool/worker with some special ability [now or in future]). So what makes it so great?

It's beautiful and extremely thematic. Kids love to play it with no regard for points, just trying to build "the best" house (whatever that means) while adults still have something to think about. It's not another completely random kids game that makes you yawn after 5 minutes and I think the biggest challenge of making good kids/family games is to make a game that's not overwhelming for the young ones, but has something to offer for the adults. Here, it has been achieved.

Cute and simple. Would rate higher if replay value was better and came in a more compact box. As it stands, you see every card in the game on every play, so most of the interesting decisions come from the cards other players choose and pushing your luck on the order you build the different levels of your house. If this was the size of Sushi Go (basically pocket sized) then I could justify bringing this to game night more often.

There is a little strategy to be found in this game, but it's completely let down by the luck element. You can have all the planning strategy done correctly, but if cards won't come your way, in the right order, then your house becomes a mess. There are a few things vitally important in this game:
1. Going first/early in the turn.
2. Building basement rooms early.
In a 4 player game, it's quite possible/probable that you don't have a basement room build by turn 7. In this case, any room you draw on turn 7 (that isn't a basement room) is just binned. This continues for the final turns - your only option is to take a basement room - opening up a construction space above that. Your turns become pretty much chosen for you. 
Going first is so important. Ignore the roof bonus and aim for either the first player token, or for actions that allow you to act before the 1st player. 
It's just so luck driven, that it's not worth playing - except maybe with young children.

Meseszép, meseszerű grafika, ami egyértelműen hátán viszi az egészet, de mellette a draftmechanika is abszolút jól működik. Ahogy szűkül a tér a házban úgy állít egyre nehezebb választások elé a játék.
Gyors, könnyed, rövid, kezdők számára könnyen emészthető, egyszerű játékmenet. Az egész egy grafikai mestermű, ahogy az azonos jellegű kártyák illeszkednek, hogy az összes kártyán eszméletlen fun utalások találhatóak. Nagyon jól kitalált egy darab, ami a világot nem váltja meg (nem is akarja), de könnyed szórakozást ígér. Pont azt nyújtja, amit elsőre is feltételezne róla az ember.

A drafting MPS where you build your tableau with some spatial planning required. Kinda like Kingdomino, only the narrative is much more engaging - you're building rooms in your house. Otherwise it's set collecting (no engine building! Yay!) with some details to keep in mind. 

The good: [i]illustrations really make this an evocative experience. [/i]
The bad: [i]well, it's MPS, but, but... has a story! (or a picture, look, it's engaging)[/i]
The ugly: [i]every room you build is 1 to 3 points. Expect tie scores and probably low replayability. (Kindgomino is kinda dull themewise, but at least offers more tactical variations). [/i]

I liked my few plays of it, but if I'd think about winning too much I'd probably realise the ceiling is pretty low (yeah, it's all in building the best roof you can. Roof gives most varied scores, hence here is where the game is won or lost).

A fairly straightforward game of open drafting and endearing illustrations. There are two main twists to this game – the first being that cards are paired up in columns, and the second being that there is a strong spatial element in how rooms are placed. The different combinations make drafting choices a bit more difficult and varied.

That said, this was a pleasant, but not captivating experience. There are a lot of quick, drafting games out there and I don't think this really stands out from the crowd.

tl;dr: light but fun

This is a very light, family friendly game, but it manages to squeeze in some nice choices. Do you go for that one card you really need now or wait for it in the hopes of scoring more, running the risk of not getting it?
I suppose there are a couple of different approaches to playing this game, but I don't expect this to have a huge replay value.
Still, quite enjoyable.

Pretty good set collection game with a spatial element. A similar feel to Quadropolis or Between Two Cities where the cards score more points if you get them into the right position.

I would probably rate higher but there are a couple of cards I'm not sure about, one of which seems overpowered and one seems underpowered. The helper card that lets you take from the discard pile at the end of the game is just really strong, and can guarantee at least a few points. The Jackhammer card, on the other hand, seems almost useless. You get first pick of any card on a turn, but then you skip your normal turn. You won't use this if you're early in turn order, and if you're late in turn order then it means you can't become the first player and you won't get a resource card on that round. Normally you could just remove these, but in this game you use the entire deck every game so that's not an option.

Other than those two cards, I don't have any real problems with the game. It plays quickly and it's simple enough to teach in a few minutes.

Fine little game. Sometimes a bit too random and too "locked" where to place rooms.. 
Roof tiles a bit too important, and to some degree a bit too much "you should do this if you want to win", instead of really trying to build different homes - it's a bit too "this is how a house should be" for me. 
I defintely like the game, and enjoy playing it - but I also have a feeling it could be even better with a bit more options to think "out of the box"

Cute, light game which is fun with kids.  Artwork is adorable and makes it fun to create your "home".

Pleasant surprise, I knew it would be light, but decisions can be surprisingly tough and you have to change your strategy often, and on the fly.

It's a very simple game of set collection, definitely too simple for adult and gamers. 
The replay value is so low and you will get bored with it easily. But I can see why this game has its charm, the artworks are amazingly beautiful and perfect for children, which also have a bit of decision making element that really fit to introduce in early age.

The game is very basic, but it is really well implemented and fun to play. Moreover, it is pretty short so that it makes up for a good filler.

This is a great looking game and the theme is there, but in the end the game is just a bit too light for my taste.

Solid 7 family material.  Non-threatening, non-offensive, mamby-pamby material you can enjoy with the kids.

Gateway card game drafting rooms with improvements to pattern build your home from the ground up.  I do like draft mechanics that pair random room and improvement cards to work out the best value combination.

Simple decisions and a lot of randomness (could be lowered a bit with special "helpers/workers") but the game is very nicely painted and it flows easily. Perfect for lazy Sunday with the whole family. 30m of play time and at the end of every game we enjoy watching not only ours but also other players' houses. I recommend it for families with kids under 10-12 if the random factor doesn't bother you.

Perfect family game with nice theme, good mechanisms and design.
Luck is clearly important but it's fun anyway. Not for players who want to plan strategy.

OK game, but a bit difficult to get any high score with it given the randomness. Theme makes the kids want to play it, but the game feels constrained and you don't get to do much of what you want to do. A bit complicated in terms of scoring at least for my kids. I prefer Kingdomino over this.

Very nice production but too light for me. The kids enjoyed it, without using the tool card abilities, but I feel there are better drafting games (like Sushi Go) out there for them.

I'll admit that we mostly play this because of it's whimsical artwork and it's a game our whole family can participate in (from 4-40).  We have found it very good for teaching math and set collection strategy to our kids, while not being too heavy or long.  And it's always fun to look at the cards while playing.

EN: definitely not a game for adults, or at least not for long. As a family game (especially with younger children, say 6-8) it's absolutely great, with high appeal and allowing to build child's own house even if skill doesn't allow for serious play yet. Our children are mesmerized :) .

PL: Zdecydowanie nie jest to gra dla dorosłych (a w każdym razie nie na długo) Jednak dla dzieci (zwłaszcza młodszych 6-8) sprawdza się doskonale! Zachwycone budują swoje domy, nawet jeśli nie zawsze są w stanie "poważnie" grać.

A fun, light, short little game with a great theme. Easy to print and play, too! If SPACE HULK is ALIENS the board game, then this is PREDATOR. The biggest difference between this and Space Hulk being this game is over in less than 15 minutes, and the jungle board is constantly changing around the marines. There's also no overwatch ability, as you can never actually see the Lurkers until you are right on top of them (they are always hiding in the foliage).

These are just a couple "house rules" I use with game, to make it a bit more enjoyable for us.

-New jungle hexes are revealed immediately after a scout gains line of sight to an open end (instead of after all scout actions). This makes the game go along at a faster pace and gives the scouts a bit of help.

-If a close combat on the dropship hex results in a tie, the Lurkers are routed instead of the scouts (giving the scouts a chance to win even if they lose their sergeant and heavy weapons dude). Having your sergeant and hvy weapons scout die while other scouts are still alive is a pretty anticlimactic way to lose.

This is a fun little game. It's no Space Hulk, but it's definitely worth playing.

Vietnam game squad rescue dressed up with a sci-fi theme (that works). Great short 2 player filler, shame it is not more widely known.

Only change I play (to give the Marines a shot at victory) is lurkers can't spawn on the drop ship [we play drop ship has flamers and other weapons and just keeps the area clear of nasties]

Feels quite a lot like Space Hulk (of course the WH40K background helps a bit)

RATING: 7
A "light" game that is easy to learn.
Plays really well but the game is weighted in the lurker players favour.
I have done some modifications to the rules and implemented some new strategic elements and rules just to even the odds out abit more.

Playing with Unmodified rules and without addons my playtesting says that lurker player wins about 80-85% of the times.
After my modifications its alot more cutthroat game with the lurker player winning about 55-60% of the times.

My next addon is a 3-4 player expansion, looking forward to playtest this baby.

Now I have a copy with all the components...Thanks to MY employer and our wonderful color printer...& Hulkskulker! I now have a copy of this most excellent game. Wow decisions to make and real tense-I played against my boy and his friend (13years old) they were the marines. The discussions and the talk that went into their tactics-the arguments the banes they gave their men-they were almost like real people in that jungle..hell this is a brilliant game! i can see solo play and expansions into other eras...World War 11 Normandy, commandoes, Where Eagles Dare type movies-escape from castles, from a 1950's type town overrun with Aliens or Zombies styled around the Lost Patrol mechanics-this is a great game! (marines JUST made it to the Drop Ship...I'm talking JUST...)

Out of the box the game needs some work. It functions but there's a difference between a pitched game that is challenging for one side and a pitched game that just kicks one side in the donglies. With a few tweaks though it should shine.

A tough game for the Marines to win as they must battle their way through a gauntlet of Lurkers waiting in ambush. Plays very well solitaire. Has some intense game play as your outnumbered squad valiantly fights off the swarming hoard of Lurkers rushing their position (much like Space Hulk). Much angst as you see your men die one by one. Still, those surviving each battle must continue fighting their way to the dropship. It&#039;s their only hope. Great game!

The game comes down to that one roll on the Drop Ship tile. Usually 1-2 Marines left and a stack of 6 Lurkers. In that regard the games a bit flawed, but oh how I do love the aspect of the ever-changing jungle.

The game is actually pretty fun until the very end.  At that point, the Lurker can simply goal-tend the escape hex, and make it virtually impossible for the Marines to win.  There may be ways to get around this rule, but as written the game is broken in my book.

I really miss the old days of GW. The days when they made awesome light weight AT games, and this is one of the classics when they did make them. Lost Patrol deserves its reputation as a fun game. Simple game play with intense dice rolling add up to a great package in my mind. And it still has all of the charm of the 90s graphic design.

[Played 10 times]
Simple rules, quick gameplay, abundant luck (dice rolls), some tactic.
Modular board and dice raise the replay value. The action feels repetitive and the game is likely unbalanced towards the aliens, but it is short enough to be nice to play despite these defects.
Overall it is a good "filler" (light, quick) in its category.

Own 2nd edition. Components are fine from a model standpoint though old designs and not unique.

New edition rules are lazy and ill-conceived with absolute no balance attempting to mash up old rules with new figures. The game is essentially unwinnable and not fun as it stands.

However this has a lot of potential with variable tile laying and decent theme and can be house ruled to make playable i.e. lowering genestealer turns or power and changing shooting rules. Creating your own game though isn't really the point.
 
I would simply download old rules which are available online to play an actual though also very difficult is at least possible to win as the scouts and is just better.

Mixing the old and new rules seems the best way forward

RATING: 6
This very light strategy game pits the space marine scouts vs the environment.  I've play the game twice, once with each boy (8 and 6), and both boys were able to pick up the rules quickly and are already asking for another game.  I'd get it out on the table again.  Thinking about educational aspects, the rules and strategy are so simple, there are not many areas for teaching something like math, but there is some logical thinking involved.

RATING: 9.9
Plays very well solitaire! This was replaced space hulk as my favorite solo miniature game. Just the right amount of exploration, ambushes, and dice rolling!

Fast and tense... With new miniatures and some variety with a campaign system this would be a great way of introducing players to the 40k universe. So many other mini wargame produces are creating games that support vs, coop, and solo play... I hope GW some day learns from these other companies example.

RATING: 6
This game (along with Gobbo's Banquet) was supposed to be the first in an ongoing series of self-contained mini-boardgames from GW. They obviously decided large wargames that need constant money dripping into them was more profitable instead because the rest of the series never came...

A simple but entertaining little tile based game, Lost Patrol can be suprisingly tense and strategic when played by a couple of good gamers. However dice will ultimately decide the victor and the game leans towards Lurker victory. One of it's major strengths is that it plays in under 30 minutes making it a bite-size bit of fun for two players.

Not the most amazing of games, but its rarity makes me unable to part with it!

I don't know about this one.  The rules, as written, are brutal and not fun.  It's hard to believe this was the intended gameplay...and yet there's something about it that keeps me coming back (and inspires folks to spend the time and effort to test tweaks to the rules to somehow try to make it more playable).  

I like the simple adjustment lowering the Genestealer action points from 3 to 2 each turn.  Still brutally hard but not ridiculously so.  Ten minute play time also helps replayability and adds a "just one more" element to the proceedings.

I really enjoyed this, but then I am the sort who likes to play, rather than compete, with my friends.  An interesting problem which represents very good design; taut and compulsive but simple.  I find myself wanting to play again (on either side) just to see if the scouts can get through.

Spent much worse evenings anyway...

I really like this game, even though it's tough for the marines to win (or impossible some people think). The growing and disappearing jungle concept is very cool.

I have a homemade version. Nice laminated hexes and lurker counters mounted on foam core. I use Ultra Marine figures for the team.

Of course I'd gladly trade it if I could get an original copy. :)

Homemade version.  Took me about 20-30  hours to complete-mostly assembling and painting Catachan figures specifically for this game. This was the first game I made from scratch from plans available on BGG. Did this because could not get my hands on an actual production copy.  I had a lot of fun making it.

The fact that I made my copy contributed positive to my scoring.  Probably a 7, realistically.

OWN: 2nd EDITION (Release: 18th June 2016), which now includes figures instead of 'lurker' tokens, plus some rules changes (mostly to allow use of stealer figures?)

A very simple & random game, but the way the jungle grows & changes as the tiles are placed & removed is unique enough to keep this interesting as a quick filler (about 10 mins). As I was advised by a fellow BGG-er, scratch any thoughts or comparisons to Space Hulk out of your mind. This is very basic moving & dice-rolling. But it still has something that keeps you wanting to try again, to get closer to the dropship than you did last time!

Playing the 2nd Edition by the RAW you quickly realise it is far too brutal on the Scouts. I don't believe it is very likely that anyone would have the patience or time to play the game enough to get a Scout "win". Perhaps somewhere in the world, there will be that one in a billion game where the Scouts roll enough 6's in a row to make it out of there alive.

However, the 1st Edition was nowhere near as brutal - despite still being very difficult on the Scouts. I believe that many of the changes in 2nd Edition (mostly for spawning & moving the aliens) are simply to accommodate using plastic figures instead of stacks of counters for the lurkers. Since you can't fit as many of them on the tiles, they have changed the rules to never allow aliens & scouts to "cohabit"! Instead Scouts shoot at range, and Genestealers assault from an adjacent tile. But the changes have made it too easy for the Genestealer player to assault at full strength before the Scouts can react, leading to easy kills, and the Scout player feeling like they don't have much control over proceedings.

I suggest using one of the variants discussed here:-
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1598860/difficulty-tweaks-collated-2nd-edition-2016

There are enough suggestions in that thread to allow you to tweak the game's difficulty to your liking. Our current favourite is "Genestealer player only has 2 actions per turn".

Good fun for 30 minutes.  Not deep but some thought is required, though the luck of the dice will ultimately hold sway.  Perfect to play with 7  year old kids: much easier than Heroscape for example.  As the scout player you really feel the anguish as your men are slowly picked off; the lurker just feels... well fertilised with blood and bone.  Easy to print and play from the files here on the Geek.

RATING: 6.5
A unique and very simple little game from GW from right before the time they became evil overlords of chaosy customer hating frauds.

It's like Spacehulk light. 5 Marine scouts explore the jungle trying to find the crashed escape pod, except the jungels alive, and odds are those marine are gonna die.

With two very competive strategy minded indiviguals, the correct models for this (Which you provide yourself) this can actually become a hugely engrossing and amazing interesting game to play..

Far deeper and more complex than most people give it credit for, yet simple enough to enjoy with any opponent.

This game is easy to play with some interesting tactical choices in movement and splitting forces. By grouping your marines, you can add combat bonuses to better withstand ambushes. On the other hand, if you send your marines out on their own, you increase the odds of finding the drop ship sooner. The constantly changing jungle and ambushing lurkers hunting the marine squad gives this game a theme similar to the original "Predator" movie. Lost Patrol is to Predator what Space Hulk is to Aliens.

A great little GW game, with a 5-man Space Marine Scout squad working its way through the undergrowth on a hostile planet, fending off murderous 'Lurkers' that ambush them along the way.  A short and relatively simple game, using a modular board built by laying tiles, that feels very like Space Hulk Lite.  Very difficult to win, but great fun.  Works very well solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
More miniatures to assemble from Games Workshop, though these are relatively easy.
The game itself is brutal if you're the marines, boring if you're the genestealers.

Printed the rules and tiles from the files here at BGG; already had Scout models (printed the tiles in two sizes, one for 28MM GW scouts and one for my stand-in 15mm sci-fi figs.
Gameplay does resemble Space Hulk, which I also own, though not as much depth here. But it plays faster than Hulk, and takes up much less space. And with the 15mm scale, it is very portable and great for lunch breaks, as I just found out.

This is a fantastic game. Amazing in its simplicity and incredible if you have any interest at all in Warhammer.  As a hex-tile freak and a Warhammer fan, I knew I had to get this game as soon as I read about it.  It took a few months but I finally got a copy on Ebay.  I added some bling-bling right away (see photos) and I must admit I have fallen in love with this dandy little game.

Fun if you like "last stand" type games. Simple, fun game mechanics, but is realistically impossible for scouts to win. Okay, they might win one out of fifty games, but that's more games than I will likely play. Extremely unbalanced.

I have Space Hulk and Genestealer -- I want to see what parts I need to play this. Maybe I can make my own...

In this 2-player game you choose either scout-marines or the 'lurkers'. Scouts are represented in familiar WH40K miniatures when 'lurkers' are just cardboard paws.

Board is created with a pile of hexagon tiles (which forms as the scouts continue travelling through the dense jungle). Your destination is to reach the dropship before the 'lurkers' take out your entire team. As the team explores further the jungle divides into many sections and some of your team-mates might even get lost (never to be found again).

I like the game, but have to say that the only way it seems the marines can win is luck. I may be wrong, hence why I still want to play. I've played 10 times now and just can't work it out. My 8 year old loved it and it's got me thinking about house rules. 

I also like the fact its a quick play (15mins) and is easy to set up.

Still evolving strategies.  The marines must expend scouts to burn through the hidden tile stack.  The lurkers need to corral the marines into tanglevine and otherwise limit their mobility.

[b]FANTASTIC SCI-FI FILLER - WITH MILD RESERVATIONS.[/b]

This rare gem has brilliant run-and-gun gameplay; you'll have to fight tooth and nail to get to the dropship, that's for sure.
Light and very enjoyable, you could end up battling against a friend for hours if you swapped sides to see who got the furthest through the lurker-infested jungle.

The game has simple rules that make perfect sense within the Aliens/Predator theme. Each turn tough decisions must be made: run headlong into the unknown; ready weapons for a stand-up fight; split the group up to cover more ground; stick together to provide covering fire; or a combination of the above.

In each game that I have played, the lurkers have mercilessly picked the scouts off one-by-one, in great Predator tradition. The scouts have NEVER won - using the original rules. They came bloody close, believe you me, but they still died alone in the steaming jungle.
Dismiss those that tell you this game is too hard; they haven't played Dungeonquest...

Lost Patrol also plays solo extremely well.
If you can find this beauty, do so. And make sure you play with painted miniatures.

For this game to be taken seriously, though, you will have to alter the rules regarding the end game. It's just not good enough as it stands for the game to rest always on one dice roll needing to be a 6 on a D6.

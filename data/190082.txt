Gioco davvero Ok!La versione semplificata di Whitechapel.Scorre a mio avviso meglio riducendo di molto i tempi morti dovuti dalla scelta di chi uccidere e quando del primo episodio.E' davvero caccia all'uomo.E vi assicuro che per jack è molto piu complicato perchè il tabellone e sensibilmente ridotto ed al suo interno aree piu ristrette per piazzare i segnalini di partenza.Insomma...Fiato sul collo!Consigliato!!!:-)

I've only played it three times, but it feels much too easy to win as Jack. It's a wonderful game, and I really enjoy it. But it doesn't feel balanced to us, and whoever is controlling the investigators tends to have a lot less fun. 

Will update as we continue to play.

As a previous fan of Letters from Whitechapel but always felt like that game was just too long for what it was, I was happy to see this game come out. This uses the same movement system as it's bigger cousin but still has the same general theme. This one plays in about an hour but still has a lot of tension playing as Jack.

RATING: 7
This a solid hidden movement game. Easy to learn, plays fast. It would've gotten a higher rating if not for the fact that it's immensely hard to win as Jack, especially if playing with experienced detectives.

RATING: 7
It was fine. It seems like it is very hard to be Jack. I was not a super big fan of how small the board was. At times it was hard to see/read. Ultimately the objective is pretty similar to Specter Ops/Scotland Yard. And with the new expansion coming out I think Specter Ops is clearly the better game. I will still play Letters from Whitechapel but when I want a quicker tighter experience I will likely grab for Specter Ops or Escape From the Aliens in Outer Space.

Letters from Whitechapel is a 10 for me.
This is a much shorter, distilled version of it. It has almost all the elements as LfW but on a smaller board, and is over in 1 to 1.5 hours. But it comes at the expense of the full intensity of the original longer version. 
If I had to between the two, it would be LfW. But there is a place for this if one wants a quick n dirty intermediate game that scratches the cat n mouse itch. However, it is at the expense of the loss of tension of LfW.

Key takeaways from Whitehall Mystery, compared to Letters from Whitechapel:
Letters is still the deeper game. It plays like a slow burn, with Jack having an easy time of it in round one, but sweating to reach to his hideout if he makes it to round 4. Whitehall is less cerebral and more frantic almost from the first move, as Jack must reach an objective point in each quadrant of the board. This means the investigators eliminate 25 percent of the board after each murder, and the pacing is faster as a result.
Playing as investigators I didn't notice much difference between the game experiences, but as Jack it feels more difficult in Whitehall due to choke points on the map and having carriages and lanterns removed from the game after use. The Whitehall board is smaller but has almost as many spaces for movement.
Both are brilliant, and Whitehall is different enough from Letters, that if you like Letters, you'll likely want to own both

RATING: 9
Wow! Cuts all the problems with Whitechapel but keeps, maybe even improves on, its depth and plays in an hour with time for deep thought. Tense from the beginning, sustained throughout. Frankly, can't see myself bothering with Whitechapel again. What's wrong with it? The plastics peelers; it's a matter of taste of course, but I prefer the wooden markers in Whitechapel.

Really enjoyed, game has clear rulebook and is quite easy to learn, during the gameplay i was really excited since sometimes i was  standing next to investigators and they haven't arrested me. To me it's better than Letters from Whitechapel because the game is shorter and Jack does not have to go back to his cover.

MSRP $39.95 is too high for this, FFG and Asmodee‘s “price floor” business model  of no more then 20 percent off, and they seem to set that MSRP  artificially, it will keep this too high in price for what it is. Google “price floor”. A board, card board shield, 3 plastic figures, bunch of cheap disc, 8 cards? 

Here is the cheapest of FFG and Asmodee. 

There are 3 optional  rules. 

For one option rule you needs a blue disc for every 5 of the included discs they give you, these blue disc are from the base game of Letters from Whitechapel, another option rule you need  2 figures from the expansion of Letters from WhiteChapel, or you can just substitute something, like salt and pepper shakers, sarcasm. 

This is how petty and childishly FFG is and Asmodee. Seriously, those blue disc have to be less then 10 cent, total, what is the cost of two cheap unpainted plastic figures?

But they want $40 bucks? This is what happens when you add in another company to the mix, FFG is now under Asmodee and both want a lion’s share of profit.

I have no interest in Asmodee‘s tax to support local businesses, around here out of 6-7 so called game shops that just means that supports that card crap they sell, and board games are a token business or nonexistent, as the card games support their real business, comic books or sports cards. Nor do I think their games are special, that they should command a higher MSRP. What Asmodee has done has added in a high fee for their involvement in FFGs. 

This is a $35.00 MSRP game at best with a street price of $20-$25. There is nothing in this box to demand $40.00. There are better games out there for that price.

Wow. I don't know exactly why, but this feels way better than its bigger brother, Letters from Whitechapel. It's significantly faster, tighter, and is actually fun at max player count. After my game as Jack, I was stressed out and said I didn't want to buy the game, but thinking back on it, now I kinda do.

Our first hidden movement style game. Have played twice now. The very first game was a bit of a bust because we ended it in 3 turns (ack didnt really know what he was doing... ) but we had another go and it was a ton of fun. Lots of strategizing. We really got into it. Will definitely play again. Super quick to setup and dive into.

Extremely pleasing purchase. Improves on everything that I didn't like about letters from Whitechapel and streamlines the package, shortens, even the box is smaller. 

The set up is now nil, with little difference between the 'acts', the rules are simplified so that you could take a year between plays with little to no rule look ups, the board is shrunk, without obvious loss of depth or clarity. 

Negatives, I miss the wooden pawns of the original. The game is now shorter and maybe slightly less deep, the player count is reduced to four max, however I wouldn't be reaching for Letters if I was looking for a six player game. Between this and FOD, I think I have this genre sorted.

When comparing this to Letters from Whitechapel, it makes for a difficult choice.  They are very similar games, and I would strongly wager that you don't need both.  It is shorter than Whitechapel, encompasses slightly less, but the feel is the same as it ranks at the top of the secret movement genre.

I know the community thinks this is best with 2 but when one of those 2 is Husband, the games go really quick. The man is an investigative bloodhound! I must get at least one other person (two would be even better) who is stubbornly independent to play with Husband, then they may not be willing to go with his strategy and I may succeed in getting to round two.

Seemed to me that the balance was tipped quite favorably toward the Ripper. Even when the investigators were making excellent deductions, their arrest guesses never had better than 1 in 4 odds. That said, if you are into hidden movement games Whitehall Mystery is likely to scratch the itch.

12-12-2017 - This is what a light version of a game should end up looking like.  Love the feeling of the chase this game brings that is nearly indistinguishable from the regular Whitechapel game.  ...But that's all it brings.  Whitechapel remains the superior game, but for the thrill of the hunt (or escape if you're Jack), this one really hits it on the nose.  Loved it, hope to own it soon.  8

Basically Letters from Whitechapel, but having a smaller board and not requiring the murderer to return to a hideout. While I do miss the aspect of trying to pinpoint a hideout, I also like that Whitehall takes he fairly simple but strong logical deduction aspects of Whitechapel and dramatically shortens the game.

First impression after one 3p game.  I enjoy cat/mouse deduction games like Scotland Yard and Letters from Whitechapel.  I found Whitehall Mystery to be the best of this kind of games so far.  The map is interesting, the cat and mouse chase is on early and almost unrelenting, the game is shorter and feels more intense than Letters from Whitechapel and more focused than Scotland Yard.  The rules overhead is minimal and elegant. 
 The asymmetrical powers of the detectives are a nice touch.  When given the choice and with a player count of 3-4 I would choose or suggest this over Letters from Whitechapel or Scotland Yard.  Feels as though the designers of Letters from Whitechapel took their experience and feedback from players and improved an already very solid game design.

My wife adores this game. It is a fantastic cat and mouse game. As the detective you just think you are getting on top of Jack and he can disappear in an instant. As Jack you can feel the detectives breathing down your neck and that causes a lot of tension. I think it works best with 2 players.

-Having to announce you're going to search for clues for every single adjacent location
-One mistake from the Jack player and you're going to have a bad time

UDATE: Only played with 2, probably a lot better when you can hear people discussing with 3 or 4, which I will try to do in the future.

Very exciting game! The Jack player will be all like "oh God, they've got a track, and any moment they could find me" while the others are like "where the hell could he have gone?!" and it's just awesome to find a clue.

However, you really can't have the Jack player make even a single little mistake. If he does, it will be extremely frustrating for the other players, more so than any other game I've ever played. I see myself as a person who can easily overlook mistakes, but if you're going on a wrong lead for an entire round, even I found myself angry. And I can't help but have this constantly in my head. "Did I really miss a path or did the Jack player make a mistake?" It's too bad, because otherwise this is a great, pretty straightforward game.

Also, the first few rounds have none of the before mentioned exciting moments, so it starts out pretty meh. Another, slightly annoying thing is that you have to stop looking for clues once you found one. I understand this is for balancing reasons, but this leads to the fact you have to one for one ask "Have you been there? How about there? Have you been there?" for every adjacent location with every policemen.

A twist on the classic Letters from Whitechapel. A different map that is smaller and has an additional terrain. Jack also has a different objective in this game. This game was made for smaller player counts and definitely more beginner friendly.

Letters from Whitechapel's little brother, with streamlined faster play,  lower player count, and smaller board (but similar number of spaces). The main change from LfW is that the "Jack" player must visit 4 pre-selected locations, one in each quadrant of the board, rather than returning to the same hideout multiple times.

Mostly stand-alone, though does allow minor incorporation of elements from both LfW and it's Dear Boss expansion.

I expect it to be played more frequently than LfW due to the shorter playtime & being easier to teach. Since it's simpler to introduce to new people & more compact (smaller box), this could actually act as a nice "travel" edition. 

After disappointment with the over-priced content of Dear Boss, this might just be the series' redemption. Hopefully it has similar longevity/replayability to LfW. Time will tell.

YES! I am a sucker for [thing=59959][/thing], so I had to buy this just because. This is an awesome game. It is basically the same game play with a twist. You have to have 4 locations and start in one and make it to the other 3 without being caught. This game is super hard and I have been really loving it. Easily a keeper for me. It does play in half the time of the other game. Super hard to win as Jack in this game as well.

This is a marked improvement on Letters from Whitechapel, a good game in its own right. The zoning of the board and the board size reduction prevents a clever Jack the Ripper from routinely escaping from befuddled investigators. Play balance is very good. At two or three crucial junctures of the game the investigators have to speculate on the killer's actions and thinking. Without a good intuitive guess, the killer escapes. It also sanitizes and abstracts, in an effective effort to make it more family friendly, the murder of the 'Wretched' in LfW.

Excited to play this more. It did not capture me the same way Whitechapel does, but the more streamlined, less fiddly ruleset definitely adds up for much of it.

I am a huge fan of Letters from Whitechapel.  I rated it a 10.  This game is not as interesting.  In LfW the investigators have an ongoing objective - to narrow down Jack's hideout.  Having that missing component in Whitehall really reduces the enjoyment factor for me when playing the detectives.  Still it's an okay game.  LfW is the superior one though.

UPDATE: Changed rating from 7 to 8.  Played 4 games now and Jack has escaped twice.  In LfW Jack escapes less than 10% of the time.  This is growing on me.  LfW is still the supreme game, but this is not far behind!

Fun hidden movement game. Plays slickly although with the wrong players I suppose it might drag. The theme is morbid but you don't really have to pay attention to that (although I wouldn't play the game with some sensitive people). One ding is that I was slightly bending the board back to make sure it sat flat and it snapped. Ah well, probably my fault for being a little too forceful.  (I've never played Whitechapel so I have no comparison, but I hear this one is more to the bone, less chrome.)

Whitehall does many things better than his bigger brother. It is faster, which the biggest the biggest issue with Letters. It drops the unexciting interludes between the nights and it used the entire map. Your only reason to prefer Letters is the difference between having to visit 4 different locations in the four quadrants instead of having to come back to the same hiding place. That alone makes both games relevant as they are both solid concepts. I am certain that Whitehall will see more playtime only due to game duration.

This is my first Hidden Movement game and really enjoyed my first play 2P as Investigator. It was really tense for both of us, but I think it’s a lot more for Jack player.

The map is really tight, so Investigators can be right upon Jack trail from almost the  start.

It really evokes the feeling of a chase.

Currently still in the honeymoon phase, but enjoyed playing the game as Jack. Has a much more focused feel compared to Letters, and seems to be a distillation of the hidden movement mechanic. Very tense throughout, with each movement by Jack needing to count.

RATING: 5
An interesting design with a strong sense that this could actually be a fun game.  However, the central  "one-two-three reveal" card mechanic just didn't seem to produce sufficient fun, perhaps because the player prediction analysis centered around trying to predict which of ten numbered cards each player will play, a player prediction analysis that felt too wide open, inexplicably feeling almost random at times for the first half of the game.  

By the second half of the game, this problem was ameliorated somewhat, presumably because enough cards had been expended, but this did not seem to compensate sufficiently for the negative experiences of the first half of the game (Oh, I should have played my 5 card instead of my 6!? I should have guessed that?  Curiously annoying!), and ties being resolved in a clunky fashion (very annoying).

I really like the length of the game versus the complexity (enough complexity to warrant my time, but easily playable at lunch).  I think it is funny that USA was not one of the nationalities in the game. (really?  Norwegian "celebrities"? heh.)  Some of the buildings offer tempting capabilities, but I think they can be a trap to waste too much money often.  There is definitely some defensive play in this game, which can be unfortunate if left to a losing player to make (to keep a winner from winning even more...)  In the end it doesn't get higher rating from me because it is largely a guessing game as to which price card your opponents will reveal.

A fairly light bidding game with a theme that isn't used very often!  Players bid on improvements to their hotels, and also engage in price wars to attract groups of tourists to their hotels, thus making them money.  Some tourists will pay you extra for specific features or have other special rules that will alter their length of stay or how much they'll pay you for a room.  Pretty neat, and a good entry into the super-filler category!

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

This is INCREDIBLY difficult to rate after just one play. The rules were worded a little confusingly and there's just so much going on here that I didn't even have my head wrapped around the game until like halfway in.

There's a lot to consider both every round and long-term. Like I said it's a bit overwhelming the first time but it's also what makes the game as good as it is.

I dig the theme even though it really doesn't feel that themeatic. Why do all the guests of the same nationality leave and arrive at the same time?

There's nothing I particularly dislike, I just feel like I only played half a game since it took me that long to really understand it. Hence the six. Likely to rise with more plays, and definitely something I'd recommend to fans of auction games.

RATING: 6
Interesting bidding system. Players have a hand of cards which have two different numbers for two simultaneous auctions: items to buy, tourists to accommodate. For items to buy, you win with a high bid; for tourists to accommodate, you win with a low bid. In both cases, the player who is winning the bid might not even want it at that price. Kinda interesting like that. Once a card has been used to either buy an item and/or accommodate one or more tourists, the card is discarded. Late in the game the game play is highly constrained by what cards everyone still has left. There is thus a huge benefit if you can keep track of what cards others have played, and thus still have (everyone starts with the same set of cards). I personally am not good at that, and don't enjoy trying, and when played with similar people, it's fun. I would not enjoy playing with people who are willing and able to track what cards people still have available.

RATING: 5
I'm not sure how I feel about this game. It is a bit tricky to explain as it seems more situational than processional, and this is reflected in the ‘fun’ one experiences when it is played for the first time. The core idea is to make money from lodging tourists of one of four nationalities in your hotel, which starts out with but 6 rooms. Every round new tourists come to your ‘island’; only when a previously selected nationality arrives again do the already visiting inhabitants of that nation leave. Players bid with a limited set of nearly single-use cards for extensions to their hotel as well as room price; but the values for these two items are chosen so that winning an extension will almost certainly not get you a visitor and vice versa. The bid is blind and simultaneous, which can lead to a few nice and not too-unpleasant lockouts.

Players get money from lodging the new-arrived tourists, and get extra for lodging special tourists. However, you don't know which tourists arrive until the round they arrive in becomes active, and it is [i]that[/i] element which sours me a little on what otherwise would be a simple and otherwise friendly game. You cannot guess the number of tourists appearing on the island, but since you also cannot get rid of them easily, the game seems to become very ad hoc. It would appear to be a conscious design choice; on the other hand, the way the tourists appear makes forward planning quite difficult as it is.

All in all a game which seems to be content with what it is, and drags a bit near the end. Not something I need to play anytime soon again, although I'd join in with some grumbling if asked.

RATING: 7.5
A mix of familiar game mechanisms combine in an interesting way with this game of travelers in paradise.  It's hardly revolutionary, but still, it's enjoyable.

Each round visitors come to the island from one of four countries.  You can bid to improve your hotel, or try to low-ball your room price to get more guests.  Those dual bid cards only get used once, so clever bidding is essential.  You also have to keep an eye on those guests, because you know ahead of time when they will leave.  Is it worth filling up your hotel with guests that will stay a long time?  Not in this game, because here they only pay once, not for every night they stay.

This takes awhile to get a grip on the strategies, but players soon get the hang of it.  The components are perfectly nice, and the playtime is just about right.  I'd suggest snatching this up if you see it for a decent price.

This game has an interesting bidding mechanism in that higher you bid on hotel improvements, higher your hotel rate is. So although you may win the bid to build that penthouse, no one may stay at your hotel that turn because your room rate is too high. If you bid too low, you may not make enough of a profit to win the game.

Hotel Samoa is a pretty good blind bidding game that gives the same feel as For Sale, but with more decisions. The theme of running an island hotel is great (why don't we see more games with a hotel-management theme), and while not everything fits the theme (e.g. guests pay the same price whether they stay 1 night or 6 nights), it does a good job of giving the same kind of stress a manager might feel trying to attract as many guests as possible and shoehorn them into one's establishment.  It's a family-type game that plays in about an hour, and my wife and kids enjoy it quite a bit.

A family-compatible blind bidding game where players try to attract groups of tourist to their holiday resorts. Players with the lowest bids get to select their guests first while higher bids earn more money provided there are any customers left by that time.

The game is part hand management because you can normally use each bid only once and part double-guessing because you want to be as expensive as possible while avoiding unprofitable vancancies.

The later rounds when bidding options are becoming limited are especially important and it's there that the drawbacks of the blind bidding scheme become most apparent. Tiny differences in the accomodation prices can make a huge difference in net results.

Hotel Samoa is a 3 to 6 player game.  The goal of the game is to take away as much money as you can from tourists.  Each turn, citizens from a country leave your hotel and new arrive.  Each player chooses a card that indicate the cost for building and the cost that visitor will pay for a room in your hotel.  Then, all players reveal their card and the player with the highest building cost can build something.  The player who offer the lowest price for his rooms can accommodate tourist.  Tourists have different power, rich pay double, star make the tourist in adjacent room pay double, pool lover pay more for each pool, lover can be 2 in the same room.  The game last 12 turn and the winner is the player with the most money.

Interesting ideas, but the game is basically a series of double auctions using cards. You bid for the right to build an upgrade to your hotel and to attract tourists. The tourists actually pay you the value of your bid, but the players with the lowest bids take them first. The problem is that the mechanic used is blind bidding (and with 12 rounds, other auction methods would make the game too long). Even though there are some tactical decisions, the overall sense is of lack of control and extreme randomness. A small error in outguessing your opponents in a single bid can have a huge impact on the outcome.

Not a bad 45 minute game! I was pleasantly surprised that the simple bidding mechanic, which is similar to Tikki Topple and Niagra, translates into great fun. Goal is to get the most money at the end, by charging guests for a limited number of rooms. Each round players secretly select a bidding card (1 of 11, each with successively increasing bids for hotel renovations and room rates) and simultaneously revealing them. Highest renovation bid gets the option to purchase a renovation tile (one is revealed for 9 of the 12 turns), while the lowest room rate bid gets the option to put up rooms for a varying number of guests. Renovations include luxury rooms or swimming pools which rack up extra money, but could also include the ability to retrieve two previously used bid cards, or kick out two current guests.

A random number of guests are arriving from a different country on each turn. However the wrinkle is this: they pay only once (whatever room rate bid you put up), but stay until the next batch of guests arrive from that country on another turn. Arrivals may be one turn apart, or up to four turns, where you make no money on filled in rooms in the meanwhile. There are only six rooms, and only one guest can occupy a room, so it is a juggling act in maximizing room occupancy, upgrading your hotel for better cash flow, and timing for guests that leave (there is also a bid card that evicts two guests, if you want them to leave earlier to open up some rooms).

The guests are varied in type, affecting how much they pay you. The "rich" guest will pay double your room rate. The "swimmer" will give you additional fees for every swimming pool you have. The "movie star" pays the regular room rate, but neighboring rooms have their rates doubled. The "lover" can share a room with another "lover", even from another country! (An interesting rule is that both lovers leave when one lover is leaving due to new arrivals from his/her country.) And then there are the "normal" guests that pay the regular room rate, unless they're put up in a luxury room, in which case the rate is doubled.

There are several neat mechanics intertwined to make for fast, fun play. It is almost as comical as an episode of "Fawlty Towers"!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2016)

I have seen Hotel Samoa in many sales, including Tanga´s, so I was expecting a very bad game, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Hotel Samoa´s rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 6 minutes. Playtime is around 1 hour and, as players play their cards simultaneously, playtime isn’t affected very much by higher player counts. Best with 4 players.

The game components and art are ok. The theme is there and you do feel it through the game. It isn’t a particularly exciting theme, but it isn’t bad for me either.

The game decisions aren’t heavy, but they aren’t obvious either. In each turn you have to gauge if you want (and have the space) to get new tourist and/or if you want to expand your hotel and then choose the correct auction card. Anticipating your opponents and analyzing when the tourist will arrive/leave is very important and fun to do.

Bottom line, Hotel Samoa is a good family game that can accommodate up to 6 players and plays, relatively, fast.  It is very light for my current tastes (thus my rating) so I won’t buy it, but I could play again if requested, however, I won’t seek out additional plays.

Hotel Samoa has a predecessor called Bungalow Boss which is only available online at www.mastermoves.eu. It's the purest implementation of yield management in a game that I've seen so far. I enjoy Bungalow Boss a lot and was thinking that this system should be transformed to a real boardgame. Well, here it is. This time multiplayer and with some more common twists added that make Hotel Samoa less abstract and more suitable to a bigger market. Nonetheless, the appeal to the BGG crowd will be limited as the central mechanism is blind bidding. For me, HS is another prove that blind bidding is far from random and unfairly maligned as a mechanism. At 45 minutes it's an uncomplicated admittedly not to deep but also not meaningless choice to finish off a game night. It could have stayed closer to the original yield management concept though. The bells and whistles added don't add more challenge, just flavour. Probably better at the lower end of the player count.

It's not boring enough for me to want to get rid of it, so we'll see how it fares over the long term.

It feels like this game really needs an expansion to give it the depth it deserves. There's an interesting foundation here, but it needs more. Bidding is at least balanced in such a way that one person won't just get to do all the things while everyone else falls behind.

Rather average family game. Bidding is the key game mechanism. Maybe a bit too long for what it offers.

RATING: 6.5
This is a quick to explain filler. The ending was a bit odd because of the number of usable cards you have (10) and there are 12 rounds.

I'm not sure if one tile is overpowered because of that (the one that allows you to take two cards on your hand)

This won't be a favourite of mine but the blind bidding and ties work  and it moves quick.

I usually do not personally prefer blind bidding games.  Some are okay and this one too just seems okay, to me.  The gist really feels like how you set yourself up for the end game of the final round or two.  The sixth round is also important.  But, it does play quickly once you get the hang of it.

Was taught a fairly significant rule wrong so don't think I should rate, but I think I still got some of the feel of the game enough to comment. This has the old school euro feel of simple rules with a lot of interaction, but then abstracted theme. There is a lot of trying to outguess your opponent, and different things having different values  at different tines gor different people creating some interesting dynamivs. However, it also seems to be really swingy. Playing a card one to high can mean the difference between filling up your hotel a ton gor a round where they only stay for 2 nights, or going empty handed, which can easily be like a quarter of the score of the game.

Funny bidding game. Tourist from different countries visit your hotels. The idea is to host as many tourists as possible in your hotel, and put them in your rooms so your profit is as high a possible.
Fun theme, but game mechanics are (too) simple. 
Good enough to have fun with it a few times.

Flabbergasted by the low ratings. It's a fun auction and hand management game. The theme is very nice as is the art. It plays quick with little down time. It's not very complex but there is enough happening that there is ample strategy involved. Picked it up for $15 and it was absolutely worth it.  With the pricing it commonly goes for now it is maybe the best value out there.  If you like auction/bidding games, especially simultaneous bidding this is a real winner.  My wife and I will play it many more times. Might become my go to game with non-gamer friends.  Cool interaction with the bidding and plays quickly with no down time.

Super-filler. Covers 3-6 players.  Nice bit of hand management using a single card to bid on upgrades for your hotel while at the same time setting the room price for housed tourists.

Played once with 4, had a good time and there were some grumbling about wishing they done something different once they saw the cards that were used in bidding (which usually means they kinda liked having been dupped).

Nice family game.

A not-so-exciting auction game of expanding your hotel and having guests stay there. Has some elements of For Sale, and while the theme is one that really intrigues me, this game does everything but.

RATING: 4
Bid blindly to improve your hotel (pay money) and attract tourists (earn money). The core mechanic could have been interesting: balance your improvements so that you get a return on your investment, attract the tourists that return the most money given how long they will stay and so on. However, the blind bidding where you have no information to work with turns the entire affair into a luck feast. It would still have been OK for a filler but Hotel Samoa is too long for what it is.

RATING: 6.5
A theoretically fast-moving auction game. The simultaneous selection mechanism should mean that the game scales at O(1) as the number of players increases, except that it takes so damn long for grown adults (including myself) to accurately calculate the money earned from guests each turn. And to figure out how best to lay out 6 circles on a board of 6 squares. Ends up an AP fest. Also knocking off some points is the seating advantage -- happening to be in the prime tiebreaker seat for guest accommodations on a particularly juicy round confers advantages that don't have to do with skill. Finally, the game ends up being way too mathy and not enough fun.

Gioco semplice ma non banale, le aste per aggiudicarsi i clienti e le migliorie sono un po' troppo fortunose (specie se giocato in 6), ho la sensazione che la vittoria venga un po' assegnata a caso e con il passare dei turni il gioco pare ripetitivo. Tra i pregi la semplicità della spiegazione e l'adattabilità anche a giocatori occasionali. Opera prima di questo autore finlandese, gioco da provare.

Une bonne surprise que ce jeu là : quelques mécanismes originaux (départs et arrivées des touristes), un tour de jeu rapide, un certain humour (ah, ces touristes japonais !), un hôtel qu'on est fier d'améliorer et de remplir (et surtout de vider pour faire de la place aux nouveaux arrivants)...

Sans rentrer dans le détail de règles (disponibles en ligne), ce jeu mérite d'être découvert pour son côté je-réfléchis-un-peu-mais-dans-la-bonne-humeur, pour des parties rapides (optimum à 4 joueurs), sans prétention, peut-être un poil répétitives mais toujours plaisantes.

Supply and demand system with great theme integration and solid player interaction. Simultaneous card play to secretly bid for hotel improvement and tourist acquisition. Plenty of factors to consider each round, including types of tourists, lengths of stay, cash management, and other players' positions. Lots of tactics but little strategy, due to high luck in tourist draws and the fact that all but 2 people often do nothing in each round, meaning you dont get enough "turns" to invest in a strategy.

I found the game to be nothing earth-shattering, but you did have some fun decisions to make. I played it 2 player with 2 boards so the choice to trump my own second business was a choice that doesn't happen in a 3-6 player game. Overall, I liked the theme, and it played just like it was supposed to if running a hotel in samoa was what you wanted to do...except bidding for the building crew...not sure how big a business building crews are in samoa, and if they have a bidding war, but that is another story...or game.

It was not dry as I thought it might be. The choice of cards affecting both parts of the game, in an opposite sort of way was a good mechanism to keep tension going throughout the 1 hour time-frame. It was better than some of the other games coming out of Essen 2010.

Gameplay: Choose a card that has 2 numbers on it, one for building tiles, the other for guest payment. Take the highest building number on a card for the player to go first, then the next and so on until building tiles are all taken or passed on. Then take groups of tourists and the amount the pay is the second number on the card. Usually the numbers are at odds with each other. If you are going to be the first to build, odds are the second number is not going to get you into the running of taking in guests, unless others players can't fit them in their hotels. There are bonuses on a few guests that matter where they are placed, along with some bonuses for having built tiles beforehand. The tourists leaving and coming is a very easy mechanism, but perfect for more choices to be added - how long will the guest stay and clog up my chances of more money, if it is a celebrity the longer it stays the better usually. Just a lot of fun decisions, not a lot of deep-meat here, but enjoyable just the same. Schacht's California is what it reminds me of, but the cleverness of the money in California did not lead up to a non-dry game, whereas this game doesn't delve into much on the clever end of things, but produces a good hour-long game...and dare I say very wife-friendly, or non-gamer friendly.

I believe the 4 player game would be the best, or maybe 3 players. 2 players with 2 boards was just perfect because I always had something to do in a turn whether or not I was shut out on one hotel. Maybe 3 players with 2 each might be ideal??

2plays: Wow, this game is really good. It totally exceeded my expectations. It's a very sharp little Euro with elegant rules, smooth gameplay, and great strategic and tactical choices. There is some randomness in what building tiles come each round, and how many tourists show up. One just has to adapt to it, but it's not unlike in any other game. Strategy comes into play because you know when all of your tourists are going to depart, but there are also ways to rid of em before their flight. There's plenty to think about with the types of tourists/and their abilities, the building tiles, and the bidding. In the bidding, you are actually prospecting prices for building and booking, so there's a fine little balance in how much you want to spend for each thing. But you can always pass and get your bid card back, and save it for later. The game plays perfectly fine with two with the 3 player rules, so I recommend it with just two players. There's some discussion about it in some threads, and there's also a dummy variant. All im all, a solid game that's highly thematic, fun, easy to play, has excellent components, and the gameplay is great. Currently going for $12 on Amazon, get it!

A family friendly auction game with some nifty ideas surrounding card management, bidding timing and looking for the right opportunities when they present themselves. Sure, it'll get old quickly if you play it often enough, but for an occasional outing it plays with six players and comes in at well under an hour. If you like outthinking your opponents (trying to guess what their plans are), and easy rules then this has some appeal.

RATING: 7.5
A bidding game with set collection. My favorite aspect of [b]Hotel Samoa[/b] is that it scales surprisingly well - with six players it doesn't add much time at all. Why? Actions are very often simultaneous so adding players is negligible. Only complaint is that the game doesn't come with enough coins - not even close! Use poker chips.

If you want a euro-ish game that supports up to six, this is a good and inexpensive option.

Everything works well enough here, but nobody seemed to have fun playing Hotel Samoa. Players especially felt frustratingly constrained by their decreasing number of options as the game progressed and many bid cards had been discarded.

However, our game group found it at times restrictive and dull but never the light and fun game I think it was intended to be.

Each round new tourists of various nationalities will arrive at the island, and new upgrades in the form of build tiles will be available to buy for your hotel. Players will simultaneously choose one of their price cards to play, which indicates both your bid for building a hotel upgrade, and the price you set on your hotel rooms. The tourists will of course seek out the cheapest hotels first, so you must carefully plan when to demand sky high prices, and when to drop prices low in order to attract the tourists right under your opponents' noses. All the tourists have different personalities and abilities - so be sure to get the ones that benefit you the most. And of course you can enhance your hotel by building extra rooms, a swimming pool or perhaps a luxury suite? 
In the end it's the cash that counts.

RATING: 6
Another solid but uninspiring game in the blind bid, auction genre. Players have a fixed set of bidding cards reminiscent of El Grande. From that hand, players must decide when to play bid cards which allow them to either build improvements or woo tourists into their hotel. High bids win the auction for building improvements while low bids enable players to attract visitors. Thematically, this makes absolute sense. Tourists will seek out deals and bargains and hotels that offer low bids will tend to attract customers. However, a single bid card usually contains both bid values, so winning the build action selection may not net you any tourists and vice-versa. Very El Grande-esque. Winning the game hinges on playing the right card at the right time to oust other players and net the most number of dollars.

Game last 12 rounds which I feel is a tad long and it is unclear to me the strategy necessary to win this game. Blind bids coupled with simultaneous action selection always makes it tough to plan long term. Folks with good memories will be able to count cards previously played by others. 

A decent game without any major flaws. However I highly doubt I will be eager to pull this one out on the table often.

Good game. Light, but has interesting decisions.

I probably would rate it a 5 or 6 if I would have paid the full $40 for it, but since I was able to get it from Amazon for less than $10, it's graded on a curve.  I hate blind bidding games as a general rule, but enjoyed this one quite a bit.  It was a pleasant surprise and is different from other games that we have.

A lot more cutthroat than I thought it would be and definitely improved it's rank in my eyes.

I ended up liking Hotel Samoa a lot more than I expected, but that statement comes with a hefty condition. Nothing in the game is particularly new or different, but the specific way in which it plays gives it a subtle quirk. The game is very easy to play but it may not seem interesting to many players. I really like the theme, and the game has some great thematic elements like specific customers that enact different effects and opportunities to players. For me, this affords a lot of meta-narrative which I will always push when I find it. With the right people, there can be a lot of mirth on offer.

It plays quickly, even with five and I can't imagine it going too much longer with six as the bidding system only affords a certain number of actions regardless of player count. As a teaching tool, it emphasises planning, timing and bidding.

Not sure why this one doesn't get slightly higher ratings.  Pretty easy, yes, but I like it.

overproduced. Very random with 6 players, maybe better with less.

I would love to get all of these annoying guests out of my hotel so that I can get a good night's sleep.  I may even poison their hotcakes, if it comes down to that.

And guests, look!  A swimming pool!  If you hurry, there are free hotcakes at the bottom!

Lots of blind bidding. I really seemed to understand it at first glance. You can bid high to be able to add to your hotel or bid low to grab all the customers. Some customers stay a little while and others a long time. Finding the balance is the challenge.

Fairly light.  Fairly interesting.  Interesting tension between play opportunity and play benefit in the bidding mechanism.  Rather random but not negatively so in my opinion.  Fun theme

Played the second time with 6 - I think it would be wayyy better with 4 or less. Looks like a flop with my group.

everything works, but after one play with a full 6 players, I'd say it's maybe better with less players and the bidding is a bit foggy, everyone understood how to play but the game seemed to lack a wee bit of sense and "a-ha/fun!" moments, still like it for what it is though

Very straight forward game. But whenever we play this we always enjoy it. not very complex, playable in 40 mins.

The doctor is back. I can't remember the last time I had such positive feelings for a game... in fact, this may be the first deck builder that I can actually say I love. The rules could have been written better but that's a grip I can live with, what with them being only a few pages long.

RATING: 7.5
Good enough and certainly easy to teach. There is the feeling of adventure as you strive to overcome various obstacles with your thematic cards - pushing through trees and bush, paddling over rapids, paying off natives (?). It's fun for sure and very speedy. Each game will feel only slightly different as you essentially build a deck to meet the obstacles ahead. It usually comes down to a turn or two differences in the end - which is thrilling. I like it.

Looks good and I think it would be a good compromise game between strategy, deck building and without too much take that.

RATING: 6
This is a very easy-to-teach and easy-to-play racing game. Modular board increase replayability.

You can learn the game within 5min and setup the game easily too. Per game is about 30min plus minus (won't be 60min in any case).

The reason of getting it 6 is because the game went broken after one play - there is a dominant strategy where you just need to buy 1x transmitter to get 5 golds, then to buy a 5 step bamboos and 3 steps water bamboo, and spend all the rest for 6 step bamboo one-time use card and you can reach the goal faster than anyone else.

The secret is to keep the pool lesser rubbish card (my advice - do not buy whatever card whenever you can, only buy those key card). I rather spend those card moving or do nothing just to cycle my deck faster. 

Nevertheless, it's a fun game that I would play again but not when I have option for others (too boring as dominant strategy won me my 1st two games on a huge lead)

this seemed mystifyingly easy until we started playing, almost like paris connection in that regard. There are definitely interesting decisions to be made, and the way in which the card offer refills makes deciding when to buy cards a non-trivial decision in itself.

RATING: 7
The deckbuilding element of El Dorado has the nice idea of limiting the choice of card types available at any one time, but allowing players to choose what will replace a depleted type. There is a good range of card types, enabling movement across specific terrain, some one-use specials and some providing a chunk of money with which to buy more cards.   The modular boards offer some variety but don't change the game profoundly.   The game plays quickly and it presents a fair few decisions about your route and your deck.

The short rules set and streamlined play make this very accessible to non-gamers.  The card artwork has a nice thirties pulp fiction look and production quality is good.

Great game. Deck builder fans will not be amazed, but I am trully tired of games, whose goal is to gain points.
Here you have to reach El Dorado first. 
You have to know when to stop deckbuilding and start running.
A definite nine for me, because there is huge replayability due to the variable map configuration.

RATING: 6
This is a very nice deck builder race across the terrain hexes to try to finish first game.  It plays quickly with, I suppose, the excitement of the game being in the suspense of the race, shopping and building a nice deck of cards, and getting, yes!, just the draw you need, at just the right time.  

This excitement is, of course, readily deflated by those turns when you draw precisely the cards you do NOT need, and are thus, it seems, are faced with buying a card you do NOT want.  (At this point, a true gamer, I guess, blames himself for building a bad deck.)   Then again, that is nature of playing deck builders (and dice rollers):  you love the luck, and the suffering in between, presumably sweetens the happiness of that one REALLY good draw, and of course, the winning draw!

In the final analysis, this is assuredly a well designed, gateway level deck builder, with a race element.  Tip of the hat to Knizia, a GREAT game designer.  As such, I can understand why this game was nominated for the Spiel, and as I see it, when compared to Kingdomino (which did win the prize), El Dorado should have won the Spiel.  Nevertheless, for my tastes, i simply have little interest in playing this again.  It's not my style of game, so I have to give it a 6.

Well-done game. El Dorado plays quick and provides lots of variation between plays. Further, a different board set-up changes the valuation of the cards during the game. The deck-building provides some strategic depth as there are numerous ways to build and then thin your deck. Plus, the decision on whether to buy a card or move your piece further on the board makes for engaging turns.

Knizia's deck-builder with a board and it does not disappoint. It plays really well. Despite the fact that I'd heard it is a light game, it still felt lighter than I expected. I like the element where the player who buys the last card of a type chooses the next type to come down. It's classic Kniziain that it keeps an interesting idea (deck-building) simple but also getting something new out of it.

The actions and objective in this game are very simple to understand, which makes diving into this game easy. Its depth of play is icing on the cake. Figuring out the best way to play the market and what paths it opens up to you is a lot of fun. Especially at four players where scarcity becomes an issue to consider. Really, really enjoyed this game. Willing to play back to back sessions also, as the game is breezy and feels perfectly timed for its weight, depth, and appeal.

RATING: 5
As a whole, El Dorado is not a bad game: the problem is, it isn’t a good one either.

It’s just the usual Knizia, a simple game based on a few basic mechanisms everyone can grasp quickly and then repeat over and over: it’s a deck builder, but a very limited deck builder; then it’s a race game, but with limited interaction with the other players; and it’s definitely an optimization engine too, but with very limited opportunities to optimize your deck.

I’ve played it a few times already, always trying different strategies, but each time it felt bland, dry, unappealing: it feels just like more of the same, a blend of the same trite and overused mechanisms we’ve been flooded by for years, with no real meat or substance to it.

As said, it’s not a bad game overall but it’s not one I look forward to playing again either.

The game works, and does seem to have a bunch of different ways to play, but I do wish their were more cards that changed up more per game.  Curious to try the 2 player game, where you have 2 pawns, but the 3 player game also worked well.  Fun game, but nothing about it had me screaming "Wow".  If this had come out 5 years ago, I think it would get more attention for sure.

"Reiner Knizia deck-building racing game". As a long-time hobbyist, I see that description and I want to rush out to try it. How would Knizia interpret deck-building? I've played deck-building racing games, like Salmon Run, and been underwhelmed -- would this be better?

Yes, it is better. The game has a great tension to it, like any great racing game should, and the deck-building aspect works well. All the cards are useful (though, obviously, some are situational) and I like how you can look at the board and plan ahead. Hanging onto cards for later rounds, not usually something you can do in a deck-builder, is surprisingly important when combined with the barriers -- players will use the barrier as a reason to sit and churn cards, getting the right combination for use after the barrier. When someone finally knocks it down, then it's a rush forward!

I feel like multiple games, even with the different board layouts, might feel same-y. But only played it twice so hard to say, Two and four players, both enjoyable. I think I'd enjoy it most with four.

November 2017 - another deck builder with interesting board play.  This game is simple enough to pick up and play but there is some depth and enough different for this to hit the table.  It moves quickly and the board is variable.  I really enjoyed this one and look forward to playing again.

Ein Deckbuilder und ein Wettlaufspiel - und dabei mit relativ wenigen, aber schlau erdachten Regeln ausgestattet, sodass das Spiel auch Einsteigern schnell erklärt ist. Obwohl wenige Regeln, hat das Spiel seine taktischen Finessen und Tücken, macht auch in weniger erfahrenen Spielgruppen Spaß. Schön auch, dass der variable Spielaufbau unterschiedliche Schwierigkeitsgrade zulässt. Für die erfahrene Expertenspielgruppe ist die Komplexität und Spieltiefe dennoch zur gering - das ist aber auch nicht die Zielgruppe. Gelegenheitsspieler finden hier aber einen super Einstieg ins Deckbuilding. Und für alle gilt: das Spiel macht Spaß.

A race through the jungle over three types of land (jungle, water, desert). You start with a deck of cards of the same type. During the game you play the cards from your hand to move over matching land tiles. Desert cards can be used as money to buy better cards. At the end of the round you replenish your hand up to 4 cards and repeat until someone reaches the temple.

Simple tactics combined with simple deck manipulation makes a nice short game that also kids can play. Nothing deep, but lighthearted fun.

After four plays; Upped the score a notch. I still have doubts about the longevity of the game, but despite being light and luck-bound, I'm enjoying the interaction on the map more than my first play.

Deck building race game with an emphasis on race rather than deck building.  Inter-game variety comes from the changing course, not what cards are available.  Different courses requires players to build their decks differently (and possibly thin them at different points in the game).  

I thought it was really neat and it's the only game that Amanda insisted on playing 4 times in a row during our first time playing.

I've been looking forward to The Quest for El Dorado for some time and it finally made it into stock at my FLGS. Upon first play I had some pretty mixed feelings about the game. Gameplay itself was fun, but I think the low msrp and odd component choices really bring this game down. I would have preferred paying a higher msrp and getting both full sized cards and more cards. The relatively limited number of cards in the game is going to effect replayability in the long run. Still an interesting take on a deck builder, but I think Clank! still does it better.

RATING: 7
Despite the derivative design (typical for Knizia these days), the game has a few interesting ideas. I like how you are forced to upgrade to cross the 2 or 3-value paths, and think the card market mechanic (one player chooses which card is available for everyone to buy) is neat. Unfortunately, the game is still just a generic deckbuilding race game, which already exist in spades. We'll see how long this holds our interest.

A neat mish-mash of deck-building and racing. The trade-ff is interesting... if you spend too much time improving your deck and not moving, you'll get too far behind, unable to catch up. If you don't improve your deck enough, you might get out to an early lead, but then get passed by those who created an efficient deck.

Overall, I had a good time playing, but it also didn't leave me eager to play again. A game I'd still be happy to play if someone else suggested it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The boards really dictate what cards are good and what aren't on this go around. One also can't underestimate the power of a whittled deck with card drawing. One can easily jump from one of the board to the next very rapidly. It is surprisingly interesting juggling movement and engine, as opposed to VPs and engine. There's also some timing questions as purchasing the last card of a stack (which might be very important if it is a strong card that you want) allows the next person to play to purchase any card still in the game (which might be a card they need or might be an even stronger card than the one you purchased).

However, as with almost all deckbuilders, I suspect this one will shine even brighter once the first expansion is released.

I'm a lot less interested in racing games than I used to be, but having the race be so dependent on blocking and the addition of the deckbuilding component make this fun for me.

An entry level deck builder game that seems perfect for families. You play your cards to move along the board and buy some more powerful cards. The best part of this game seems to be the modular board, which will make each race very different. However, for me this falls short of Clank! because the decisions are just a little too easy and straightforward. I get why this was nominated for SdJ since it is light and good for families, but since I mostly play with gamers those few extra decisions in Clank! make all the difference for me in terms of which game I would rather play.

Just had my first play-through and I had a great time playing. The game is really super fun. Every turn your decisions matter (how to get the best out of this turn), but it's also not devastating to miss an opportunity. So it won't melt your brain, but you are constantly engaged. I played against my daughter of 10. She loved it too. She won with one turn difference! So in the end it was a very close finish after all! I found the 2 player variant nothing but sheer brilliant.

This is a very deserving SdJ nominee. The game is simpler than Clank! which it shares the deck construction and race elements and is much more approachable for a wider audience. The rules are dirt simple to explain and the game hums along at a very quick pace leaving you with a "one more game" feeling. Four plays in and like so many of Knizia's previous games, I suspect there is a significant amount of depth beneath the surface.

Knizia nous revient avec ce nouveau jeu de deckbuilding pour aller chercher les fameuses citées de l'El Dorado. Je m'attendais à un jeu plutôt gamers. Pas du tout, c'est un jeu à ranger dans la catégorie des colons de Catane : un jeu pour initier les nouveaux joueurs au jeu de société moderne. Des règles plutôt simples, un matériel de jeu qui fait le job (quoi que un peu austère). Un premier pas dans le deckbuilding avant de se lancer dans du un peu plus complexe

Played this recently with four players. It's an interesting mix of a race to the finish line with a deck builder. Cards in your hand provide movement points to get through the terrain. Some terrain requires more points than others so buying more powerful cards or picking other routes are a must. If you're not quick to buy cards, you can stall out and be drawing a whole lot of stuff from your hand that isn't useful for the current area of the map. Trimming down the deck is tough though, since only a few places or cards will let you trim down your deck. In all, it's light and feels like it might get stale after a few plays. The design is prime for expansions in terms of new maps and cards. Not worth owning but willing to play every so often.

A nice, clean, rules-lite game that combines deck-building and map movement. It’s a fun puzzle to figure out how to get through the maps and is surprisingly interactive.  I find the game quite engaging. But it loses a full point of the ratings for the bad decision of having small cards for a deck building game. If you have a game that is going to ask the players to shuffle repeatedly, make the cards big enough to do so comfortably. If that basic usability issue weren’t a concern, this game would easily be a 9. The expansion will be an instabuy!

El Dorado is a deck building race game where you want to be the first person find the lost city of El Dorado.  There is a fair amount of luck in the game, but not an excessive amount for the simplicity of rules.

This is one of my favorite Knizia designs of all time.  It's a tight streamlined game of traditional Knizia fashion but with a theme that seems integrated from the start instead of pasted on afterwards.  This was one of my favorite of the Spiel des Jahres 2017 nominees (along with Magic Maze) - and I played all 9 nominees.  

--- EDIT
Went up to a 9 from an 8.  PLayed it with my 7 year old son and he liked it a lot too.  It's simple enough to grasp, but still fairly deep in strategy.  I'm really liking it right now.

Players are racing through a jungle wilderness, trying to be the first to El Dorado.  Neat, light race game, using deck building mechanics to make progress.  The beautiful modular game board can be assembled in thousands of different ways, creating race courses that range from simple, to challenging.  Terrain consists of jungle, water or villages, which require a matching suit of cards to move into, or hills (impassable), caves (for goodies if using a variant), boulders (cost any card) or base camps (trash any cards used to enter).  Very easy to pick up and learn, especially if you have played deck builders.  This one treats them differently - as your deck mutates rather than gets stronger.  Picture yourself hot and sweaty in the jungle, gazing at a large river ahead, and thinking "I need a boat very soon..."  Very interesting, and of course, works very well.

Edit: After 3 games in an evening, rating bumped to 9.  The "difficult" maps are a nice mental puzzle.  Excellent game.

Edit: After 20 games, it still feels fresh.  We’ve experimented with build your own maps, and picked up a second copy for “mega” races (and a spare deck of cards).  My 8 year old son has started playing it with no problems at all.   The SdJ nomination is well deserved.

I liked Orleans as it felt like a deck builder without the cards which I bemoaned about repeatedly shuffling in other games. This game has taught me that it's not the cards that bothered me, as they don't bother me here. In fact I like the deck building on offer here; perhaps it's the race and the absence of it being about my personal tableau and being all about the board, a shared space. The interaction isn't particularly high here, which is a slight knock, but I have really enjoyed my plays so far, and am looking forward to playing again and to seeing if this system get expanded or borrowed for a similar game.

RATING: 7
Combines deck building with a race game.   And that's pretty much all there is to it.   Other games have done this (e.g. Salmon Run), so there isn't really anything new here at all.   The presentation and components are decent.   The constrained nature of the market is odd.   Is that good for the game?  Necessary?    That will turn off some people, but maybe the game needs it to avoid degenerate strategies.    It moves quickly, but can feel a bit dry and boring.   In other plays, I've felt the opposite where it was tense and exciting.   I think the cave tiles add some needed spice and excitement beyond the tension of the race.

I was concerned it may have the problem other deck builders have: a feeling of playing your own private game. Several things reduced, but not did completely remove, that feeling: 1) The map helps you visualize player positions; it's much more intuitive than hidden-but-trackable victory points. 2) Blocking on the map was a welcome interaction. 3) Choosing whether to open up a new card in the market added interesting interactive decisions. 4) The deck is simple enough (and the same every game, thankfully) that you can remember which cards other people purchased.

The first race was a photo finish for two of the three players, so it had a satisfying climax.

It's the right length and complexity for my tastes. I'm looking forward to playing more and finding more levels of interaction.

Quest is a deck-building game on its face, but its modular board, and race element help distinguish it from the multitude of Dominion-esque titles. Stranger still is Quests lack of card variability. Every card is used in every game, which is incredibly rare in any deck-building game. The game could certainly use at least some card variability, but the various board setups and interesting market population mechanic create enough diversity to warrant several plays. All told,Quest is game worthy of its SdJ nod.

El Dorado is my favourite of this year's crop of SdJ nominees but I'm not surprised it didn't win. The game is a fairly typical rehashing of various elements that we've seen in other games before, with players racing across different terrain types (most recently, Lemminge) using a custom-built deck (Dominion et al) of movement cards.
Simple rules, short playtime, charmingly old-school, with a few small twists to make it fit for the 21st century. It's not exactly Knizia's return to the gamers' gems of old (it's lacking both depth and that special something extra) but El Dorado is very good choice for what I'd call the advanced family level.

Knizia Autor, Vohwinkel Artwork, ein TIKAL Tempelgoldgesicht mitten und haltlos auf die Schachtel gepflanscht, altbackener Titel - alles an EL DORADO schreit nach 90er. Knizia, der Rechenheft-Familienspielautor, beschäftigt inzwischen ein Brainpool-artiges Team, um den typischen Knizia zu bauen. Das Ergebnis fährt auch in EL DORADO mit der Zeitmaschine zwei Dekaden zurück, im Falle von "Wettlauf" (eigentlich ein typisches HiG-Wort) als Wettrennspiel via inzwischen vielfach kopierter Soft-Deckbau-Mechanik. Moderne trifft auf Muffigkeit. EL DORADO spielt sich fluffig (00er), flott (80er) und ohne Anstrengung unterhaltsam runter, so dass man es gleich nochmal spielen möchte. Und es schreit nach Erweiterung: Landschaften, Karten, alles geschmeidig modular und bei Markterfolg auf Kassenbon gebaut. Ravensburger und das  Weihnachtsgeschäft waren schon immer Knizias Lieblingsquellen. Die alten Indiana Jones Filme mit dem jungen Harrison Ford könnte man zum Spiel auch mal wieder gucken.

Deck-building meets a race game.  It's a lighter game but it works really well.  I  like the small adjustments to normal deck-building which add more decisions.  Both the ability to hold a card over to the next draw and the market mechanism where empty slots are filled by the next buyer who brings off-market cards into the market.

This is a high 7 potentially an 8 for me. I could see this going up if the people I play with get a little more comfortable with the cards and knowing the different strategies so we can kind of metagame each other and feel the excitement about meaningful moves or buys at the same time, or if an expansion makes some big changes. 

Otherwise, this is a good, straightforward deckbuilder with a seamless racing integration. It's like you get to play Flamme Rouge with less mathy and more varied decisions that somehow don't add any complication (to be fair, if I was teaching parents or something I'd prob pick Flamme because there is less reading in that game and I think the more reading there is in a game (in this case, on the individual cards), the harder it is for non gamers to feel comfortable, no matter how simple the gameplay actually is).

I like the fact that there are multiple viable deck designs and that you feel anticipation/stress before your draw as you see what you get. I like how turns fly because you draw your hand at the end of your turn and can plan your next moves while other people go. I like how those plans can be ruined by people blocking (a really elegant solution to player interaction in a deckbuilder). And I like how quick this game goes - even teaching very slow people, we got it out and finished in about an hour. I'd expect this to be 40 mins at 4p when teaching my normal crowd. 

I'm looking forward to playing again and trying out some new deck strategies.

RATING: 8.5
Gave this as a gift to my 8 y.o. daughter. After three plays on three different maps, we really like it. The game allows for some significant strategizing about route, what to buy and what to trash; but playing out your hand each turn is mostly quick and easy, so the game moves along at a good clip. It has something of the feel of Ticket to Ride in this way. 

I like a lot of the design choices: Different maps favor different decks, and the deck you want changes as you move through the map as well. The limited market mechanism makes sure that cards are available at different times (or not at all) in each game, so there's more variety to the deckbuilding than the small number of cards might initially suggest; it also means that you continue to build your deck through the game as new cards become available, rather than racing to set up your engine and then running it for points. Having only three of each card available creates pressure to grab the cards you want quickly, but also ensures that market slots open fairly often to pull new cards in. Limiting buys to one per turn really makes you consider which card will benefit you most. I really like the option of keeping unplayed cards in your hand for a subsequent turn; it nicely allows you to mitigate luck of the draw at the price of drawing through your deck more slowly. 

So far various approaches to the deckbuilding seem viable. My daughter has done well mostly by moving steadily ahead, buying judiciously, and trashing almost nothing. I've tried tuning my deck more and trashing many cards, but the time it takes do this (especially with only one buy per turn and the limited selection of cards in the market at any time) means that I've spent most of the games trying to catch up to her.

Today (7/30/17) I played this year's 3 nominations for the SdJ.  This one shines.  Easy, streamlined, and a ton of fun.  Build your deck--just enough.  Get ahead--and block the others to slow them down--but don't neglect your deck.  The tension between buying cards and racing forward is there.  Use all the boards!  And use the mines!   Another Knizia gem.

Super solid and focused deckbuilding game. It's a race to the end of the map, using your cards to traverse different terrain and obstacles.
It's really interesting to see that most deckbuilding games offer a big range of possible combinations the players can explore, but here the focus is in efficiency, hand management and market manipulation. Some stacks are available for purchase but others only are possible to buy when one of those stacks runs out.

RATING: 10
This game is fantastic! I love the theme and the mechanics. I really feel like I'm on an adventure while I'm playing it. The modular board is great and can be adjusted for difficulty or game length.  Non-gamers can easily pick up how to play this and I feel like this could be one I could get about anyone to play. I like this far better than "Clank!" I have one very minor issue, I would have liked standard size cards instead of the little cards (although the little cards take up less table space, I understand why they did it).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Deckbuilding has quickly become a very popular mechanic these days, and this one fits easily into a neat game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  Combining this with a race element produces a seamless experience, as games like Dominion often feature a race element even if it's not specifically stated as such.  In this way, the Quest for El Dorado is similar to Clank! but it fits as a nicer entryway into the hobby than Clank! does for families.

Nice combination of deck building and race game from Knizia. He doesn't fall in the trap of the random card pool, of course, and even adds his touch: six of the eighteen types of cards are available at the start, but as the stacks are depleted, they are replaced by others chosen by the players.

The game is dynamic and flows well, with quick turns. I just felt that my first play ended too soon, with too few opportunities to use the best cards, but we used the suggested first-time layout. I expect that the modular board with double-sided tiles will add plenty of replayability. This will never be among the doctor's best-regarded designs, but it's a good and solid family game.

I'm always a sucker for deckbuilding.  And the race really gives something to chew into.  I enjoy the tough decision of how much to invest in your deck vs just haul ass.

Be the quickest one to optimize your deck and finish strong. That's every deck-building game I've encountered. The Quest for El Dorado takes this premise and literally demonstrates it. Players build a track and have to be the first to move their figures from the beginning to the end. The hex-based track is a mix of land types: jungle, water, villages, mountains, bare rock (?), and camp sites. You start with a deck of cards that can be used to get you over specific land types or can be used to buy a card into your deck from the card market. There are exactly two interesting aspects of this game. The first, you can use one card to go over multiple hexes but you can't use multiple cards to go over one expensive hex. This is what makes buying better cards a necessity as the game goes on. The second interesting aspect is the market. When one card is sold out of the primary market line, a player can purchase a card from the larger market display and add the rest of that card type to the market line. This gives players some control over which cards become available for purchase and which do not.

Those two aspects make the game work, but they don't really save what is essentially a bit of a dull, deck-building trudge across the map. I do think that this game serves as a good, simple deck-building intro for those who might find Dominion and Clank! a bit too complex, but that's nobody here, right? This is a family game through and through, which makes it an appropriate Spiel nominee, I suppose. It doesn't add anything to my play table, however.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game is surprisingly light. It plays quickly and the rules are easily taught and understood. It is an excellent choice for introducing younger or neophyte players to deck building.  I wish that the cards were full-size, but perhaps sacrifices were made in the interest of keeping the price point low.  If you are interested in something fast and fun that still involves some decision-making, The Quest for El Dorado will satisfy.

Update: After several plays Quest is still fresh. The modular board contributes a lot of variability and player count has a significant impact on strategic and tactical considerations. A terrific choice for gamers and families alike.

Knizia must have decided to take some lessons from fellow designers for a change. Perhaps we'll see more contemporary work from him in the future. 

The Quest for El Dorado is a deck building race game. Players need to spend cards with specific icons to move over matching terrain. You need to consider the routes ahead when building your deck. A little luck when drawing doesn't hurt either. This is a fine example of Knizia's ability to distill mechanisms down to their core and present the player with interesting decisions while keeping the rule set simple. 

The game is on the light side and I fear it may be a bit repetitive if played too frequently. However, the only substantial drawback for me is that it's a first across the finish race game. Race games have the unfortunate problem of having some players fall out of contention for the win. Even if the game is enjoyably tense for the leaders it is often not so for at least one person at the table. Those who fall behind are essentially eliminated before the game ends, which is not fun for them.

Despite the race element I still really enjoyed the game. The way the deck building and board are used together is unique and interesting. I would happily play this when it's suggested, but don't have much interest in getting it to the table myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Knizia delivers a successful mix of deckbuilding and race game. The racing part is taken from Bleasdale’s Lemminge, the deckbuilding is pretty standard except for the possibility for players to select the next available type of cards once a stack is depleted. The deckbuilding seems well-balanced with functions of cards ranging from terrain-specific movement or deck-thinning to special one-use cards discarded after utilization. Variety is provided by the available mix of cards and the modular board.

I really like this game. While jaded gamers complain about El Dorado lacking in challenge, being too luck-heavy or a starting player advantage, I can’t see any of those issues. El Dorado is easy to get into but it’s not lackluster. While luck is present, a wrong deck-build is far more decisive.

"Overall, The Quest for El Dorado is super fun! As mentioned, I really like the sense of progression you get through the game as you move towards the finish line. The racing component is super, as you're never totally sure what your opponents are going to do or how they're going to block you, so it's pleasantly intense the entire time. Plus, the varied tiles and configurations don't really reward experienced players that much (even though experienced players may be more familiar with the cards), as there are many different "good" routes (although there are a few places where bottlenecks can emerge). While it's more complex than Kingdomino / Magic Maze, in my opinion, I still think it's a really fun experience that's worth a play, especially if you like deckbuilders and / or racing games!"

Az a helyzet, hogy nincs mi ne tetsszen ebben a játékban... mégis... ügy érzem, hogy rendkívül kevés a hozzáadott érték. A legeslegegyszerűbb deckbuilding alapok mellé bejön a versenypálya, ami leginkább a lemminges játékra emlékeztet, ahol ugyanúgy különböző területtípusokon kell magunkat átverekednünk. Egyetlen mondhatni új elem a vásárlós sorkorlát, azaz pénztől függetlenül mindig legfeljebb hat kártya közül választhatunk.

Papíron minden szép és jó, de összességében elég kevés. Persze szuper kis családi játék, első deckbuildingnek is kiváló, de nem hiszem, hogy aki már több pakliépítős játékkal játszott sok izgalmat fedezne fel benne. Ezerszer inkább a Clank!, ha már deckbuilding/mászkálós kombó...

Race & deck-building game. Doesn't feel Reiner Knizias' game (which it is). Nice ideas and the gameflow is excellent - you'll play El Dorado in 30 minutes. This is family game and works best with that kind of situations. For the gamers El Dorado might be a bit too lightweight. Allthough this is a deck-building game, there is quite amount of luck too.

RATING: 8
First impression(s) rating after one play all by myself and one 2-player play. An advice to BGGers: do not start with the board set-up suggested for a learning play; you are already more experienced than that - using that set-up the deck-building element won't be as strong as it can be in more interesting set-ups (see Cogliostro's comment: "Deck-building is not dominant").

It combines a pretty basic Dominion-like deck building (with only slight changes to the 'standard' rules) with a race game where you move from hex to hex and you need to play cards of the given color (type) to move on the spaces. As such, at first look it's a rather strange game in Reiner Knizia's bibliography, with one of the most popular mechanisms of the past decade. 

Looking for Knizia treats, soon you find some tweaks in the popular mechanism (I like the way how other card types may become available, and - just like in a few Dominion descendants - having the choice to keep unused cards or not is a nice strategic addition) but also moving some of the decisions and action possibilities to the board (spaces for thrashing cards and in the advanced version, spaces where different action tiles become available). Also you'll find some interesting timing and strategic/tactical decisions as, after all, it's a race game. I also liked some small rule details that do add to the game, like non-coin cards being worth 0.5 coin when you want to use them for buying or the obstacles on the maps that are there against a pontential runaway leader problem. Also I found some treats like in Prosperity: a perfect hand depends not only on the set-up of the boards but also on where you are on the way at the moment and what kind of cards you'll need in the nex few turns. As a result, it's not the (not bad) variety of cards but the variety of the set-ups what makes each game different.

I need to further explore the game to see what and how much it has to offer; right now I can say it's a really nice family game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Pretty simple and straightforward deckbuilder that is a racing game. One needs to fine the balance between building a deck versus using cards to move in the race. Nice to have something a bit different from the Doctor for once.

Ein Deckbuilder Wettrennen Spiel.
Im Laufe des Spiels baut jeder sein Deck nach Dominion Art zusammen. Man kann pro Runde 1 Karte kaufen und spielt Handkarten aus um von Feld zu Feld zu laufen. Grüne für Jungle-Felder, gelbe für Wüste etc. Dabei gibt es schwierige Pfade bei denen man hohe Kartenwerte braucht und lange Pfade mit 1er Werten.
Wer als erster das Ziel erreicht gewinnt.
Ich hatte mein Deck ganz schön ausgedünnt und kam damit auch gut zurecht. Mir sind allerdings 3 mal im Spiel die Leute vor die Nase gelaufen und sind in der nächsten Runde auch nicht wieder weiter gegangen.
Dass man Leute so blockieren kann hat mir gar nicht gefallen, auch wenn es als Strategie einsetzbar und auch so gewollt ist... Nicht mein Ding.
Aber war ganz nett, man hat viele Optionen zum Ausdünnen, viele verschiedene Wege zum laufen. Viele Karten zu kaufen und und und...

Lately, I find myself gravitating toward lighter, fast-paced, family-friendly games. This game fits the bill in each category. To boot, the rules are concise. Teaching the game took 5 - 10 minutes. There were almost no follow up questions. The map is gorgeous. Its colors are quite vibrant. The modular map and caves variant allows for high replayability.

It's a race game, it's a Knizia, it's deckbuilding. All of that doesn't excite me much at forehand and this game couldn't surprise me. It's very simple and quick: draw cards, play cards to move forward on the raceboard or buy more cards, then refill your hand. Not very interesting.

I played Great Western Trail in 2017 and realized I like deck builders. A lot. However I barrowed GWT and brought it home and my wife wasn’t too keen. Then found out about Knizia’s take on deck building and I knew it would be a winner! My wife actually got this for me as an anniversary gift and we played the crap out of it! So fun! Although, I will confess I used Rahdo’s unofficial varient of trimming back some of the extra market cards. It makes it so each game has the same 6 core market cards but switches up the “advanced cards” each game. This makes each player have to see what’s available on the market and build their deck accordingly. Also, it begs for an expansion!

Surprise hit of the season. Easy to learn, easy to explain, but still with meaningful decisions.

Excellent Knizia race game using deckbuilding, where players struggle to decide whether to slow down and thin their deck, giving them a boost for later, or racing for the finish line with everything they've got, but potentially getting dealt some weak hands throughout. Lots of variation with modular maps. Would love to see some expansion cards, and maybe mapboards.

Knizia does some interesting things with the deckbuilding mechanic--not my favourite of his games but it's solid and way better than Clank, the other major deckbuilder to emerge recently. I find it remarkably hard to remember that you can't sum smaller cards to take a big action, but I'm sure I'd get used to it with repeat plays.

Solid little racing game. The only reason I don't rate it higher, and why I didn't hang onto it, is because I fear the game could get stale very quickly. Between all cards potentially being in every game and the map layouts having very little variability, I'm just not sure if El Dorado is going to go the distance. Fantastic game though, and perhaps Knizia's best in years.

RATING: 7.5
In this deck building race game by Reiner Knizia, players are explorers racing through the jungle to get to El Dorado.  You play cards to advance through different terrain (river, forest, mountain) and you can also play cards to buy cards from a common pool. 
Some terrain require more cards to get through, and there are spots on the board to permanently throw away cards. The first person to cross each hex has to pay a penalty to get the barrier, which acts as a tiebreaker at the end of the game. 

It's a fast paced and fun game. You can try to opimize your movement, but you could get blocked. You can also try to buy the right cards for your deck. There are a few things going on. I enjoyed a couple of plays of this, and want to play this more. Rating may go up with more plays.

RATING: 9
PROs: The combination of deck building and racing is so much fun! I like the ability to hang on to cards from round to round rather than discarding all cards like most deck builders. I love the different race course combinations that you can make with the tiles!

CONs: I haven't found any yet. I love this game!

RATING: 6.1
Clearly a thoughtful design and a smart integration of deck-building and race game mechanisms. At the same time, this is decidedly aimed more at the casual/family gamer than the experienced gamer. Only the most difficult of board setups (with the optional caves included) will require much forward planning or enable truly clever play, and while it's great that the game scales for multiple audiences it never becomes as deeply strategic as something like 2013's Lewis & Clark. This isn't a knock against the game, which plays smoothly, but those expecting the wild card combos of something like Dominion won't find them here.

This is the type of Knizia game I love. Simple rules and game play adapting familiar mechanisms but using them in an interesting way. The game provides for interesting decisions and approaches from game to game and the variable maps require players to adjust which cards to buy, in spite of having a fixed number of choices every game.

RATING: 8
Distills the deck builder to a bare minimum, and adds a simple movement/race game. At first I felt this was too simple, but halfway through realized it was just really fun. Moves along VERY quickly since options are usually pretty limited, yet there are enough of them there every turn to keep it interesting. The card purchasing mechanic (using "unlocked" rows) is clever and effective.

As light as this is, it's a pretty fun basic deck-builder. Unfortunately, I think it's a bit limited and may not stand up to a lot of replays unless there's a way to figure out how to make some of the higher-valued cards worth purchasing. Maybe a small expansion with a few extra obstacles and allowing a few extra choices would spice it up. Too bad the characters don't have a unique "power," that seems pretty standard in these types of games.

Initial rating: 9. 

After 7 or 8 plays: 9.5. It is such a delightful meaty filler. We have tried almost all available maps, including the 'extreme' variants, 2 player only, and it's always very tight. There is luck, for sure, but the game feels very balanced. The only thing we home ruled, and we never home rule anything, is that we removed 1 cartographer card from the game. One player can still buy two over the course of the game, if they desire, but not three. 
Looking forward to the expansion. It feels like there is a lot that can be added to spice up the formula. Thank you, Mr. Knizia!

[b]Wettlauf nach El Dorado[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]El Dorado combines deck building and a race game in a very family friendly package. The art direction has a 1920/30's illustration aesthetic and features a famous fedora as the first player marker. The simplicity of both the rules and card abilities belie a very interactive, tactical game. There are many choices to be made during the game, which cards to introduce to the market, where to move and possibly block your opponents, how to build your deck, deciding how to approach building your deck [i](lot's of card draws versus thinning your deck)[/i] all of which impact your opponents and how they'll play. 

There are a lot of map tiles and each map layout will have a big impact on how you approach the game. You can also tailor the difficulty, and to a degree, length of game play based on the chosen layout. The added cave variant introduces another decision point in the game and opens up even more strategies to pursue, it's a simple and excellent addition to the game.

I'm really a fan of deck building + games, in this case El Dorado offers a similar vibe to Clank! as far as the race element. However; the games play quite differently and I'm happy to have both in my collection. As far as the Spiel goes I think I would still choose Kingdomino because it is such a brilliantly simple game. El Dorado is probably one step up in terms of difficulty, but still a family weight game that I' highly recommend.[/i]

Finally a deck building game I actually like.  I like the fact that there are not a vast number of different cards to add to your deck and I also like that there are only 3 copies of each card.  This prevents a static approach to the game.  The different maps you can build also encourage flexible approaches to play.  Dr. K is alive and kicking!

RATING: 7
Wettlauf nach El Dorado is a light deck-building race game. Players are trying to move their pawn across a modular hex board with various terrain types and get to the end space before other players. To enter any hex, players must play one or more cards with the matching symbols. One of the symbols, coins, not only corresponds to a terrain but also lets you buy more cards to put in your deck (all other cards count as half a coin). In this way, players can acquire cards with more terrain symbols or a variety of symbols--though some of these advanced cards are trashed after use. There are also a few cards that provide special abilities. This game was very easy to learn and played very smoothly. While its light weight limits my interest, this seems like a perfect game to introduce to new gamers.

Reiner Knizia's take on deckbuilding. You're trying to race along a randomly setup path to find the lost city of El Dorado (The city of gold). The problem is your starting deck will only get you so far, so you need to build and readjust it as you go along.

The cards are rather simple, but the interesting part with the game is how the market works. Only 3 of each card and there are always 6 sets of cards out. When a player buys the last card of a set, the next player to purchase one may choose a new set to bring into the market. It allows for a dynamic and different market each game. You'll never burn through all the different sets, so each game is different. Not to mention the setup can lead to very interesting choke points on the map.

While the game is a touch light for me, it's quick and it has the "just one more game" kind of feel to it. Everyone is usually within 1-2 turns from finishing on the map, so the games are always close. Looking forward to the expansions that follow and hopefully it brings it from being light in weight to a more medium light feel.

RATING: 7
This game is a deckbuilder where more or less each card allows you to either buy a new card from the display, or play the card for movement points to be used on the central board's matching terrain. It's a straight up race to get to the finish line. We played with the advanced rules which added a few minorly interesting elements, such as each hex as one cave space where if you stop next to it, you get a bonus ability tile. It's a little bit of a mean game, because you can't move through other players pieces so you can get some fail turns due to people standing in your way, which is rough when you have a perfect hand of cards to move you ahead. The game is light, pretty quick, and it's got some replayability to it since the cards are often different, and the board can change every session. The overall experience of the game is enjoyable but I wouldn't say there's a lot of magic to it. I would play this again if someone really wanted to, but I don't know that I'd suggest it myself. So much of the strategy of the game is deciding when to spend a card for movement and when to invest in your engine. If that decision choice is enough for you and you are hurting for more simple deck building or more racing games, then this is a good option for you. If not, it's skippable.

I was intrigued by early reports of Knizia's deckbuilder and had the chance to play at LoBsterCon. I enjoyed the way the deckbuilding feeds into the board-play and the market mechanism is a nice compromise between 'you can buy anything' and random availability. I had ordered a cheap copy from amazon.de which got cancelled and will keep an eye out for the English version, but it doesn't solve the issue I often have with deckbuilders of your own turn being a lot more fun and involving than anyone else's.

Fun family-weight deck-building race game.  Rating based on one play, so *grain of salt* with that.  I like that it isn’t as random as the Ascension style market, but not as static as the Dominion style market.  It combines the two deck-building styles in a clever way.  There seems to be a good bit of replayablility with the various board combinations, but an expansion with some new cards would be nice for extra variety.  All that said, the push-your luck race in Clank! is more fun, as deck-builders with boards go. It’s been a while since Dr. Knizia has released a new, interesting design.  Hopefully there’s more good ones to come.

This game is fine with the easy maps. I like the deck building mechanic on a race game. The game really got better for me with the harder maps though. It might not be the best for players that are big into playing games over and over and over again. The replay ability might be hurt by the lack of options of cards to buy. Hopefully an expansion can add to that to change up what cards are in each game. It's not a problem with the map options though, especially if you start creating your own. The graphics on the map could have been cooler, but its simplicity and large icon make game play easy. I can see why this was up for game of the year.

I hate small cards especially in a deck builder but I bought the game anyway.  The first time we played we played 2 games in a row (2 player) and had a fun time.  I am a bit concerned about replay value though.  Only time will tell.  For now it's a keeper.

UPDATE: replay value is fine.  I upped my rating.  I actually think this is more fun than Clank.  Small cards are not really a problem.  Would have preferred bigger cards but the game is fun so who cares!

Not Knizia's best, but surely his best showing in a while. It's a deck-building exercise that brings the race-like feel of deck-building to life. Like nearly all Knizia titles, the ruleset is lean, the gamespace is variable and at least here, semi-open-ended. Unlike many deck builders, this title ramps up quickly. You get to the action tooth-sweet given numerous opportunities to thin your deck, and a malleable market which prods you with a fine question to chew on from time to time: weigh the opportunity cost for taking a permanent loss card for quick gain, or a permanent use card for consistent value over time.

In truth it is pleasant to play, and does become more interesting at higher player count where resources become scare quicker, and spaces are more hotly contested. I like this titlte, quite a bit, and would be hestitant to say it expansions are -mandatory-, but I would also be interested in what other mechanisms could contribute to the experieince.

(+) Very lean ruleset that leads to a somewhat open-ended decision space. The winning endgoal is not your traditional VP-fetching exercise. Like many Knizia's, a careful balancing act is required to ensure your own victory.
(+) Interchangeable tile setups add some variety. Increasing the trek difficulty provides a fun challenge in deck-building efficiency. 
(+) Ramps up to the action very quickly and becomes more engaging to play at 3 and 4 player count.

(-) 2-player game is much weaker. Given that you have two meeples to move, the onus is not as strong on the player controlling them to balance between forward progress and resource building. 
(-) Can, ultimately, wane in depth over time, but there are rife opportunities for clever cardplaying sequences that may never lose their novelty.
(-) Limited player interaction.

2p was quite disappointing.  With 2 figures, you are essentially traveling twice as far.  Thus trashing and tuning your deck at the first pit stop (red x space) and then proceeding is clearly optimal.  There is not balance between investment and progress that I suspect will emerge with 1 figure per player.

I worry a bit that the market mechanic where the first purchase of a card makes it available for everyone (and blocks other cards) encourages uniform decks between players.  Once someone got a good card, it's time for everyone else to jump on it too, so there doesn't feel like a lot of differentiation or opportunity to pull ahead.

I didn't try caves -- they might help to differentiate player or they might just be too random.

Deals elegantly with some issues I have with deckbuilding games in general. The racing aspect gives your buying action a tactical direction, not just the usual run for the most expensive cards.

RATING: 7
Awesome, quick to teach, fast playing deck builder the whole family has been enjoying tremendously. You have to read the terrain more than in Trains and it's highly variable with all the different board combinations. The deck building is very simple and without a huge amount of noticeable shuffling. Draw up to four cards, move, buy and optionally keep anything you don't use. If you've played a deck builder like Dominion or Trains before then 90% of the rules are just going over the obvious and you can be playing about five minutes after taking the shrink off the box.

Good timing and although the interaction is low on the easy setups it ramps up as the board difficulty increases and creates bottlenecks, but not overly so. A bit more multiplayer solitaire than Trains. That said, games are incredibly close and usually come down to someone being blocked or using the tiebreaker. We enjoy it because it's quick and simple, but with some nice little choices. Thin out your deck? Invest in water movement while making the others go the long way round? Grab a native for the tricky passes and keep the card between turns? There's various ways to approach the problem and a lot of "Get out of my way!" comments flying around. Fun.

Thurn und Taxis weight game of planning routes and managing cards. Gets the stamp of approval for a 45 minute light game around here.

Bought new from Game Universe.  Played first two games of this.  Very simple deck builder trying to traverse a variety of landscapes to reach the end. Slightly different from other deck builders as you only have 4 cards in your base hand and the pool to buy from is limited until expansion comes out.  The variety of the game board is infinite and there are opportunities to block your opponents movement at bottleneck points on the board.  Overall a fun game and easy to teach and play with family or competitive gamers.

The basic chassis is well-worn -- deckbuilding holds few surprises and it is essentially a pathfinding optimization race game. However, limiting purchases to one card, severely limiting the number of copies of each card, giving some control to how cards enter the market, and not allowing cards to combine to pay costs all subtly alter the landscape to make this a surprising nailbiter. Even so, our seven-year old could not only play but won our first game with a well-timed Giant Machete. What more can you ask for?

nice racing game that does the 'deck-building with a board' concept as well or better than other similar games I've tried; however the dearth of cards, the emphasis on generic movement cards, and 3x limit really puts the damper on this; I could see an expansion which at minimum doubles the card options and increases supply piles to allow for at least one more card than the number of players (4x in a 3p game for example) giving this game the boost it needs to compete with other deck builders

This is a nice deck-builder-plus-board-game combo. In this case, the board game part is a race over varying terrain, with the deck providing movement over different types (and some special action cards, of course). Card play is like Rococo: start with a base deck, work your way through it before reshuffling. You have a hand of 5 but only play 3 each turn, so you can do a bit of planning over turns. When you acquire new cards, add them to your hand. Cards allow you to move over specific terrain, draw more cards, buy other cards, etc.

The game plays very quickly, and there is a lot of variability in the way the course is built (although all cards are used in every game). I'd play it again, but it's a bit too light for my tastes.

First impression was extremely positive.  It's almost certainly my new favorite deckbuilder with a board.  The modular boards are interesting and fun to navigate, and the game moves extremely quickly.  It would instantly vault toward the top end of family games for me.  Only real worry is that while the card tableau mechanic is brilliant, all the cards being in the game every time might lead to the deckbuilding getting stale.  My hope is either that the modular boards resolve this or that an expansion is on the way.

RATING: 7.5
[Ravensburger 2017 English edition]  {Adventure; deck-building, racing; scalable} The Quest for El Dorado is an adorable racing game.  Kinzia made a great game again!

This game is very interactive (depends on map setup).  Players have to compete for position and market cards.  Players need to find valuable cards so that they can progress well as the race continues.  A typical game is around 30-45 minutes, a suitable duration for family games.

It is easy to teach the game.  My elder has no difficulty in understanding the game flow.  It's a little complicated to explain the market and function cards.  The map setup needs a little bit of time, too.

The design of function cards is really good and balance.  The icons are effective.

The game is nicely produced.  The cards may be small, though.  I believe the terrain type can be better, too.  Why not denser forest for "3 knife" space, etc.

Highly recommended for families with children!

It's a pity that this game loses to Kingdomino in the award; nevertheless, both games are excellent family games.

tl;dr: surprisingly fun

I'm not going to lie: it's been years since I played a new game by the Dr that I found worth the time. His output has mostly felt extremely derivative and watered down. This game though was surprisingly engaging I found. It uses deck building to drive a racing game with some small, fun twists. It's by no means a grand, deep design, but it is efficient (as one would expect from a Reiner game) without losing it's soul.
There is, of course, a good amount of luck with the cards and once you have a good deck going, you just can cruise towards the finish line, but I suppose that's part of the appeal. The trick is to know when to stop building your deck and start sprinting.

El Dorado is a solid race game that uses deckbuilding.  While similar to Automobiles in that regard, I found the decisions and racing itself to be more interesting in El Dorado.  The board also looks really nice and was fun to race across.

The game uses a unique take on deck building where there are always 6 cards available to buy. The stacks are relatively small and once a stack is emptied it can be replaced by a new stack of cards from the reserve.  I really liked this mechanic, although I felt like the game needs expansions to add more variety.

My one quibble is that the game uses mini cards instead of standard cards, so they are a bit small.  It worked OK though since the cards are pretty straightforward and didn't require much text.

First play—having fallen out of the hip loop of what’s new, I had kind of forgotten how good Reiner Knizia can be at designing games.  This is a really tight, very accessible family game that sits just a notch above Ticket to Ride in terms of entry.  

I can see why it made several short lists for game of the year, as well as into the SDJ list.  It can either be played light or with a fair amount of tactics and cutthroat gameplay.

RATING: 9
First play impression: this game is exactly what I thought it would be, and it is awesome.

I thought Lewis and Clark was a decent game but just too thinky and too long for the experience it offered. This game basically streamlines the entire thing and makes it play in about an hour or so. It also has similarities to Clank (deckbuilding, and play cards to move around the board).

This game really fine-tunes the deckbuilding experience to all of the optimal settings. If you get a bad hand, you can use any cards as money to buy new cards. At the end of your turn you can discard any cards or hold onto as many as you want. You can only ever buy one card per turn. All of this means that, for such a simple deckbuilding system, you have quite a bit of control.

I will say that I'm a little concerned about long-term replayability. There is plenty of variety within the game (the board are all double-sided and you can make tons of different paths for any game, and there are optional cave tiles that will change up the game) but the cards are always the same. I'm a little concerned that people will just use the same overall strategies game after game.

But that worry is just theoretical for now. Real world experience shows that the game is just fun.

Update: After playing some more I've noticed that somebody can fall behind or get really far ahead. I've even seen someone get really far ahead, collect all of the obstacles (which are meant to keep someone from getting too far ahead) and still win by a wide margin. On the other end, if someone makes a mistake or two then they can fall far enough behind to where they are basically eliminated. Will need to play more to see if this is a problem of the game or the players. For now, I still enjoy playing the game a lot and it plays fast enough that no one is too upset with the runaway/fall behind possibilities.

Update: moving this up to a 9. It's just such an elegant and fun system. Also, the game seems more "fair" on the medium-hard board setups. I've had a really close four-player game on one of the medium maps where all players were in contention up to the end. Really good game, will play it pretty much any time.

Racing + Deck building. Deck building is such good mechanic and I love a game that uses a tried-and-true mechanic in an interesting way. Being able to see the lands ahead and adjust your deck accordingly is simply fun. And even though it doesn't have that exploratory nature that seems necessary for a game about expedition (a la Tikal) the fact that you're not exactly sure what cards you'll have keeps you on your toes. Really good.

My one complaint is that the cards are so tiny. How am I supposed to shuffle?!

Side note, the red X spaces on the board are totally ritualistic killing sites. Pretty dark for an otherwise clean game, right?

Wife and I love Deck-Building games and is the main reason we picked this up. It combines the basic DB mechanic with a race-to-the-finish board game. Start with a base deck, buy new cards and move your piece through the jungle to El Dorado. 

Lots of fun with a ton of replay value due to the many combinations of ways to build the player board. Scaled well with 2, 3, and 4 players without feeling like it dragged on each turn. Highly recommend!

First impression: Knizia is a perennial favorite of mine, but his recent rash of rethreads has disappointed his ardent followers, myself included to a certain extent. That said, his amazing output in the past two decades will keep me occupied for a lifetime. Quest for El Dorado (QfED) in my mind has reversed this trend. It is by far the freshest and most innovative Knizia design in years. To be sure, deck building is neither new nor groundbreaking, and Knizia has never fully embraced this game mechanism. In QfED, he has successfully married deck building with a race game. Like his previous designs where the winner is NOT the player with the most victory points, in QfED,  whoever reaches El Dorado first will win the game.  I love that QfED retains many signature Knizian mechanics.

In comparing with Dominion, the granddaddy of deck building, Knizia integrated a few twists with huge consequences for game play. First is the ability to hold on to any unplayed cards for subsequent rounds. This seemingly small modification alone opens up a new avenue for strategic play: should I hold on to a valuable card for play in the next round when my adventurer advances or should I just play it and move on? It is a huge risk to hold on to cards because it is never clear if your adventurer will advance along far enough to actually utilize the holdover card. What a delightful torture. The pace in the game is quite exciting and the rhythm of the race is perfect. There are always multiple avenues to advance on the randomized board and the shift from deck building to adventurer movement is not always clear. All these variable make the game wonderful.

I thought that Orongo, Knizia's previous big box design from Ravensburger is a very-well developed and fun game, component issues aside. The game play is brisk, the closed economic system is unique and generates enough tension, particularly late in the game. In essence, it was a perfect Knizian design. QfED coming in the heels of Orongo makes me wonder if Knizia's creative juices are flowing again and that we might yet see a new act from our esteemed Doctor.

I'm not really seeing what Spiel is seeing in this game. With the cave variant there's a bit more depth, but I find it to be a more vanilla version of Clank! It's not a bad game by any stretch, but I expect it is one that I will rarely be craving to play over other deck building with map games that feature more depth (Clank, Tyrants of the Underdark, etc).

Dominion cast as a race game by a master designer. The only unintuitive bit of teaching it is the "when moving, units are never additive, when buying, they are", but otherwise it's so smooth and simple. It's also very addicting, trying to eke out advantages and win the race and/or the tiebreakers (which are necessary and elegant). A fair bit of luck, of course, where (much like Dominion) getting your better cards when you need them (usually as soon as possible) creates a positive feedback loop.

I'm still learning some subtleties, but I'm pretty sure that deck-thinning on easy and medium boards cannot be leveraged to much advantage in 3p or 4p games (it can in 2p, due to the doubled length). Still interesting choices, but that's not ideal. On hard courses, it's all good, though of course the corollary is that in 2p on hard courses, deck-thinning is necessary, which is again less than ideal. Not sure how much any of that bothers me, but I think it's worth knowing.

A real winner, one that wasn't even on my radar. A family game, to be sure, not some huge sprawling complex heavy euro, but of those there are plenty. This hits a nice, pure (though light) note.

I'm not normally a deck-builder fan but I really love this game. 
The map and race elements distinguish it. Closest thing in my collection to this is Super Motherload and I think this surpasses that (and definitely surpasses if playing in a family environment).
Tips: 
- don't bother playing the beginner map.
- for normal games skip straight to Medium or Difficult maps. 
- use the Cave Tile Variant (as recommended/intended by Dr Knizia)

Knizia really shows he is still relevant with this "just the right amount of chunky for what it is" deck builder chucked into a "get to the end" game.

Very fun game that combines deck-building and racing seamlessly. I'd like to give a 2P game a try as I think the gameplay would be even more interesting. Planning to pick this up once the English version gets released.

Quick, fun. Sort of a mashup of [thing=229][/thing] and really lean deckbuilding.

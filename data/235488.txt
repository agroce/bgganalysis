Leuke filler, met uiteraard geluk (de dobbelstenen), maar best wel wat spanning ook.
Je kan het geluk enigszins mitigeren door wat tegels te kopen in het begin.
Maar watch out, je moet op tijd beginnen steentjes te verzamelen, want in feite is dit een echte race.

Very good dice game based on the Istanbul Board game. Gives youbthe vibe of the oard game, but is shorter and easier. Instead of moving to different tiles you use the rolled dice to make combinations and gather suplies. Xith these suplies you buy the gems . When yu have 5 gems the game ends, and after anyone has taken the same turns, the points are counted. If you don't own the original game and are looking for a fun light short game, this is a must buy.

Taking an already established game and making a dice version seems like a low down trick. However I was advised that this holds up and at £15 was very tempted by the price. I really enjoy this game. I like the decisions you have to make. I like that an unusual roll can quickly change your tactics. I like that their is a wealth of options available to you, and directions in which you can move. It feels like a real scrap for those rubies. I also like that the cards vary wildly in usefulness. The fact that you could get next to nothing or you could get a ruby makes them an interesting prospect. I did feel a few of the mosque tiles were not that useful, and the crystals weren't exactly a tempting prospect to stock up on. With that said, it still feels like a tight game, and one that I've really enjoyed. Really great with two players as well, which is a massive plus in my opinion. Well worth it for the price.

RATING: 7
Dice game inspired by Istanbul which can potentially play in half the time.
It is a race game of collecting Rubies. On your turn, roll the dice and take two actions. Actions are performed by matching up combinations of dice (described on player aid). Commonly you will be turning two of the same colored good into a goods token (ie: 2 blue dice can get you 1 blue token). Then in the future, these good tokens can be used as additional symbols on a dice roll (ie: 4 blues are needed to buy the first blue-colored ruby; the blues can be any combo of blue from dice rolled and/or blue tokens).

Early on it SEEMs like you really want to focus on buying mosque tiles, which grants a variety of special abilities EVERY TURN. These abilities include being able to take an additional action, rolling more dice, getting free goods when collecting money from dice, etc. It SEEMS like the weaker actions [early on] is collecting money and drawing cards. While the cards can be helpful, they must be used immediately and many cards are "give the active player a big benefit [ie: a wild token] and all other players a small benefit [ie: a green good token]".

In a 4-player game this is pretty exponential--you give yourself one good and you've given 3 other people free stuff. (which they can then use to buy up the mosque tile you wanted, etc) So I'm very wary of drawing cards early in the game.

Thankfully the game is short and it ramps up a bit, so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

One of the better dice game implementation out there. For sure there is a little luck involved in a dice game but the mosque tiles let you create an engine of sorts to help with some bad rolls. I've used both strategies of building a slow and good engine vs just pushing for a quick ruby grab and both strategies are valid. Really enjoyed this one.

RATING: 8
If you are into fast-paced dice games, this is a good one. It’s fun to puzzle out the best way to collect and spend your resources and there are many options to consider. If you are looking for a game that distills Istanbul to its essence, you may be disappointed here.  Its nice to revisit the aesthetics and components of the original game, but this offering doesn’t quite capture the magic of its predecessor. That said, Istanbul: The Dice Game is a fine addition to family game night fare and is likely to be enjoyed by players with more esoteric tastes as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Catches the flair of the boardgame while being an interesting game on its own. Foremost, it keeps the feature which made Istanbul a keeper for me - the strategic choice of going for rubies immediately or building up an engine first. While the quick ruby strategy has an advantage in the boardgame, the engine approach seems stronger in the dice game if done appropriately and not too excessive.

One of the rare cases where a derivative of a popular boardgame is more than a marketing trick and a worthy alternative to playing the inspiration.

RATING: 7
When you play a "The Dice Game"- or "The Card Game"-version of another game, a question which inevitably pops up is: Does it feel like the original? In this case the answer is... No. You want to get rubies and you can get them by paying different goods or money and via some other means. That's what Istanbul and Istanbul: The Dice Game have in common. And that's about it. Istanbul is all about finding the right routes to efficiently get those resources you need for acquiring those rubies. In Istanbul: The Dice Game you pick up is a dice-based engine building game. It doesn't have much to do with the original game. But does it matter? Not really. The theme isn't particularly strong anyway and as a small engine builder which ramps up and plays quickly it's quite fun.

RATING: 4
For a dice game the box is too big. Played it, it requires a dice tray, it's okay-ish as a game, very point salad and family friendly. Plays only with 4, and the tray moves all over the table. 
Box should be made smaller, just a little bag of components and a center board, that's it. 
The yahtzee style rolling for stuff works okay, the cheat sheets are confusing however and the art on the dice is very different from that of the chits you grab from the pile. We ran out of green tiles, and somewhere in the rules was written that everyone has to return green tiles to the pile, and then grab in player order what one would receive. Thematically strange. Normally expected was gone=gone.

Ridiculously expensive for the cheap plastic that you get. Reasonable price would be around $10, not the 21+ right now.

12-12-2017 - Played this at BGG (last game of the con!).  It was all meh.  I really like the original Istanbul, I thought this one took the meat out.  Nations Dice I think is the gold standard for dumbed down dice games, the feel is largely still there.  I didn't get that with this one.  I'd probably pull out the regular Istanbul before the dice game every time.  6.

Endlich mal eine andere Würfel-Umsetzung als einfach nur Kniffel-Mechanismus!
Wer an der Reihe ist wirft 5 Würfel und muss dann mit dem Ergebnis etwas anfangen. Nach einer Tabelle erhält man Waren, Jokerwaren, Geld und manchmal auch Sonderplättchen. Mit den Waren und Jokern kann man später seine Würfe verbessern und dadurch an Rubine kommen, die Siegpunkte sind. Wenn man mit seinem Wurf nichts anfangen kann, erhält man als Trost weisse Steine, die in späteren Zügen ausgegeben werden können um beliebig viele Würfel neu zu werfen.
Es ist eine gute Würfelumsetzung, für mich allerdings zu langweilig. Würfel werfen und "gespielt werden". Ja, ganz so isses nicht, aber es ist nicht mein Spiel.

Removes the spatial puzzle of the original, focusing instead on the race aspect, waged on multiple fronts. The bazaar tiles seemingly have increased importance here, allowing players to build an engine as they play, yet more than one or two don't seem to be necessary to succeed. Decidedly different in feel than its big brother, yet a surprising amount has made the transition to the dice format.  Overall, better than Dorn's other major Essen 2017 release, Montana.

Az Istanbul leegyszerűsített verziója azoknak, akik egy könnyedebb szórakozásra vágynak, mint a "nagytestvér", vagy csak egyszerűen kevesebb idejük van. Jóval kevesebb lehetőség a rubin szerzésre és jóval inkább szerencse függő, mint az alapjáték.

RATING: 7
To my surprise I liked this game a lot. I don't generally like dice games and I didn't like Istanbul proper, but this really turned out to be a pleasant surprise. In this game, you roll the dice, then you can spend the dice to do different things based on the combinations you got. One combination lets you bank a token, which shows one of the die faces. This lets you stack die results for bigger turns later. Another combination gets you a technology tile, which gives you powerful new abilities. These also combo with each other satisfyingly, although there is a strong degree of flipluck involved and not all tiles appear to be equally uswful. Lastly, you can use the dice in different patterns to pick up rubies from the board, which just like in Istanbul proper, get more expensive as they get picked up. I had something interesting to do each turn, there is a cute card effect mechanism that sometimes has beneficial effects for your opponents that kept me engaged in opponent's turns. I hope to get more plays of this in the future.

I played a single game and it was okay-ish.

Apart from me preferring longer, more complex games: I actually know multiple shorter games than this one, that I'd rather play when limited to a shorter time slot.

This is a very nice simplification of the base game. Here, you’re rolling dice to try to come up with combinations which get you stuff: gem tokens, money, a market tile (which gives you some power, e.g., extra die, extra money), and possibly a gem! Like the base game, gems generally get harder to acquire (more money needed, more gems) as people get them. And it all plays very quickly.

Maybe I like this more than the original? I don’t love the base game, and this gave a similar feel in less time, with dice!

tl;dr: enjoyable dice game

One of the main mechanisms that makes [thing=148949][/thing] great and as popular as it is, is the way you have to move over the different locations and manage your disks. This dice version retains almost all elements of the game except that one. You roll the dice and get resources and money and what not that you can eventually convert into gems, like in the original. You can also build some tiles that give you permanent or one-of benefits, like in the original.
This game certainly is not as deep as the board game, but it is quite enjoyable and works well and for once we get a dice game version that is not a roll-and-write. A welcome change, even if you like those games.

Good game but with the expansion great, the map is giant but the teritories can be too tight for more units. War gamers will like it and i would encourage you to buy it with the expansion which improve enjoyment by laaarge.

RATING: 3.5
If you like a Risk game with a bit more, you might like it. Even so, rotten game with less than 4 people in my opinion. And now there are much better options to get the same vibe that play smoother and smarter. It has nothing novel to offer and simply serves up a very lengthy dice fest. Not my cup of tea. In fact, I'd much rather play Risk which knows some design restraint.

After a few games, this is really turning out to be what I had hoped for: intensive but still light WW2 simulation. I enjoy playing it!

The game itself deserves an 8, without the expansion perhaps 7...?

RATING: 6
+ Expansion. Lovely bits (but 5 value units could have been a bit bigger). Game changes dramatically with expansion, making rules hard to learn as they change. One comment from my group is that of randomly picking a conquered territory - surely if a territory was drawn as 3 oil it should stay 3 oil ??

Lousy plastic minis and ugly map makes it difficult to field this game.

Simply the best "empire-game" and WWII-game on a strategic scale, yet. Smooth, intuitive rules, great mini-games. Play with expansion to add versity, and threaded turns to bring down downtime to a minimum. You don´t won´t to play any other conquer the world-game after playing this. Downsides are perhaps that the game can be a bit chaotic due to card play and it is possible to expand quickly, but it is intended as a fun game, not a history lesson. Eagle Games best yet!

RATING: 5
I would have rated this game higher, but the rules are just too underdeveloped to allow for it.  You'll have to play with a few house rules to get what your looking for out of the game.  And the title, "Attack!" is a misnomer, it should be called  "Diplomatic Blitz!" And one more thing, you need the expansion.

It's RISK, but with odd rules.  Light war games don't have a lot of appeal to me; they drag out longer than they should for little return in your investment of time.  Apparently this gets better with the expansion, but I prefer my games to be good out-of-the-box.

This is like Risk, but pretentious.  In particular, the first half of the game is taken up with "influence" challenges on neutral countries, which essentially boils down to rolling dice and getting stuff.  This is not fun.  Also, the vestigial naval system is utter nonsense and they shouldn't have bothered.  

Just play Risk, you know you wanna.

Rating for the Basic Game of Attack only. This game really improves upon both RISK and A&A allies: Open set-up; straightforward and innovative combat system; high-quality components; and strong WWII atmosphere. Quite possibly the best game Eagle has yet made. Only a few subjective nits from me: 1) The lavish map (with expansion) would be an excellent replacement for the WAR! Age of Imperialism map. 2) They should have made different sculpts for the value-5 pieces. They are too close in scale and otherwise look  exactly like the value-1 pieces. 3) Be careful about adding players. Analysis paralysis can really grip players who have three actions to perform. Especially if players engage in wheeling and dealing the whole time.

As I was never a big fan of Axis and Allies, but play with a group which is, this game is similar enough to attract them to play it, but different enough to keep my attention. It contains some genuinely new and unique mechanics to the A&A style game. The expansion improves upon the whole and provides a range of optional/advanced rules to suit just about any taste.

The latest edition is not an improvement, and we are having difficulty raising interest in the game of late...

You must use the house rule that each player in turn gets to do their first action, then each gets to do their second etc. A player can pass on an action but if they do an action later the cost 'includes' the passed turn. This cuts downtime massively and adds whole new level to the game.

RATING: 9
What an excellent game.  Takes the basics from Axis and Allies and Risk that I enjoy and improve on them greatly with a great dice attack dynamic and simple economic system.  Also, the diplomatic cards add an edge of unexpected events and the turn modifiers and how many actions you can take are also very well done.  This is definetely my new favorite take over the world strategy game.  This should absolutely not be missed.  The only problems I see are that luck is still a definite factor that may put some people off, but tends to equalize the different levels of strategic experience.

It could have been great, but Eagle took the lousy way out, forcing you to buy two games to get the desired experience.

I thought this game was pretty boring and uninteresting.  There was so much down time between turns that I could have played another game at the same time.  I actually &quot;played&quot; 3 times in 4 hours.  After four hours we quit in favor of a different game.  Pretty much a more complicated Risk, but far less interesting than Risk due to time between turns.  I nearly fell asleep!  You&#039;d probably have to pay me to play this one again.

So many good ideas, so many that just don't work.  I love the ground combat, I love the expansion's political system, and it's all quite fun to play but some parts just seem sort of half-a$$ed.  The naval combat in particular(if it even happens) is lame and poorly represented.  The game can't seem to decide if it wants to be Risk or Axis and Allies when it really should choose one or the other.  All in all, worth a couple of plays as a "light" monster game.  Expansion is essential!

Game is like a more complex version of Risk. It can be fun, but has 2 big problems. 1) Large battles can really bog down w/reinforcements. 2) Naval combat is horrible. It relies on a mechanic totally different from the rest of the game (cards instead of dice) and typically makes it impossible to attack across the Atlantic. They should have just left it out and made the map Europe only.

A simple wargame set in 1935.  There is no history here, players claim some territory, deploy neat plastic troops and set out to conquer the world.  Combat system rewards combined arms battles.  Neat production system where sets of economy cards are more valuable, encouraging trade and alliances between players.  Small nit to pick - the size different between "1" and "5" value pieces are impossible to tell from a distance.  Glue some chips to the "5" pieces to make them stand out.  Great, playable package.  I really like the World War II "poster art" presentation.

I didn't like it. Too much downtime, too much time expired before the players actually started to interact. The naval supremacy rules are ludicrous, as are the "random lineup"style naval battles. I'm not looking for realism in a game like this, but even so, the system just feels random and silly. Everyone says it plays much better with the expansion. I'm sure they're right, but I wasn't impressed enough with the basic game to have any interest in the expansion.

Maybe my rating is unfair due to my expectations. When all is said and done, I like Risk better.

If you play Attack!, play with the expansion (a must). Very nice bits. Attack! is another Risk type game (lots of dice rolling).

We made up some house rules to make Attack! more fluid and interesting to play. Due to the rule changes, I enjoyed the 2nd game played a whole lot more than the my first game. Eagle Games rules sucks.

Got from a good friend with other games in a group deal. Took a quick look at the rules. It looks interesting.

Another game might change the game's rating.

TRADED.

I really enjoy this game. But I am a sucker for big, sprawling games with lots of things to do and keep track of. My rating is based on Attack! with the expansion. The politics enhances this game and I'd never bother playing it without the expansion.

RATING: 1
Only game I've ever rated 1/10.  Wow.  Arbitrary results, not intuitive, weak mechanics, and a disappointing feel.  Not only that, the game actually punishes you when you try to attack!  That's what earns it a 1.  A game called Attack! should not flatly discourage said activity.

It's probably a joke, the designer is sitting somewhere saying "Attack!" and then sadistically laughing at the thought of players somewhere around the world trying to make sense of this mess.  Which would be appropriate, because it's laughable how terrible a game this is.

It's not a bad wargame, I particular like the attack mechanics and attack dies for infantry, artillery hits, etc, but overall it's not streamlined enough, the province resource system just doesn't make sense (each territory has random resources - they should have just hardcoded on the map the resources in my opinion or used randomly distributed tokens) and there are better wargames out there.

RATING: 6
We tried a three player game using the expansion rules, but only the western map. I had a lot of trouble figuring out which countries were adjacent. For example, France and England. There was no travel line between them, so can I only attack with planes? We figured that was stupid, so we kind of fudged over most of the water rules. I think it needs more play. Also, the big units (that represent 5 instead of one) are not that much bigger and we never used them. We just crowded Germany up with guys, then couldn't figure out if that tank was in France or Germany. But, complaints aside, the game was a lot of fun. Be careful if it's your turn to start, because you won't go again for 4 turns, which is painful. A fun game over all, but hard to play when a more perfect game like A GAME OF THRONES is sitting right there on my shelf.

A Risk-style game with some slight improvements. A much simpler game board and rules (they seem long because of the detailed examples), gives a quick, light game of, well, attack! We played it as a 2 player game, which resolved into the Americas vs Europe/Africa. I failed in 2 attempts to invade Nigeria, but resisted a Naval battle. It seemed very balanced with 2, and we decided to try it with 4 players. We liked the cards, and the simple strategy, and the unit costs seemed well balanced. All in all, a success if you like that sort of game.

My wife and I played the basic game once and it didn't go well.  I didn't know the rules as well as I thought I did, plus we played with the optional rule that each of your four starting provinces must be on a different continent.  This rule is intended to encourage player interaction, but the primary result was that we both got eaten alive while invading neutral territories.  

I wouldn't mind trying this again, but with the [thing=6751]Expansion,[/thing] which I also own.  I really don't want to play the basic game again, which is enough to earn the dreaded 3, I think.

I suppose I could be argued into playing this game again, if my only choices were to play it or be pushed off a building. It's a typical Eagle Games product: the components look great but there is no game there. All I remember about playing was that with 6 players the game was so slow someone seriously proposed that we play a side game until our turn came up again, perhaps Advanced Third Reich? There may be a great game in there somewhere but it would require a major re-write and someone willing to play-test it, which obviously was not something Eagle Games thought to do.

RATING: 8
"Risk on steroids". More complicated than Risk but much simpler than those "serious wargames". Doesn't even TRY to be realistic. Excellent component quality. There is much randomness involved but the actual battles are fun with interesting strategic possibilities. Be warned - you need rather BIG table for the map to fit on. (and buying the expansion doubles the needed space so you probably have to play it on the floor)

I play Attack! using the original (not deluxe) expansion.  This is a surprisingly fun light-to-moderate weight WW2 inspired wargame, but with an interesting non-standard faction setup.  Ever wondered what it would be like to be the fascist (Nazi) player headquartered in the U.S.?  Now you can.  Graphic design is nicely done and components are good.  I particularly like the political/economic/technology card driven mechanics, making this a deeper experience than Axis & Allies.  This game gets a bad wrap for being only half a game with the core box only, which is fair I guess, but it's a much more reputable game combined with the expansion.

RATING: 6
First play is a 7 I like how the more you do in a turn the more it costs.  Good strategy and I like the combat system.  I don't like how far troops can move in one turn, but that could be fixed with house rules.

This is for both the basic and expansion I haven't played just the original and probably wouldn't want to.

Complicating "Risk" does not make it any better. Nice miniatures, although the bigger versions are not bigger enough. Problematic map: some regions are too small and it's difficult to determine if some are adjacent; there is also a ridiculous, unreal "Amazon" region that reduces Brazil to a small country. Long downtime. No real theme, it could be any epoch.

A good game - has the flavour of Risk but with added twists. No retreating for one - if you loose an area you loose all that was in there!

RATING: 4
The basic game is similar to "Risk" with an advanced combat system, greater variety of units, and a wider choice of possible actions.  The advanced game, which forces players to decide which actions one will make via the use of Oil Reserve Certificates (1st action costs 1 Oil, 2nd costs 2 Oil for a total of 3, etc.) is better, IMHO.

The ground and naval combat systems are also interesting and are quickly resolved.  The naval combat is somewhat unrealistic and gives the defender an advantage he should not have (limiting the number of ships which can engage in combat).

There are some loopholes in the system, namely the unsinkable lone Battleship.

The worst aspect of the game is the "down time" between player turns.  In a 5-player game, we have seen up to one hour go by before a player gets to do his turn!?!  The "Action Card" approach proposed by a player on BGG is, IMO, a very good suggestion which could alleviate this problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Update, many years later: It's crap. I played it again, and there's just no need for it to exist. The dice/combat system is decent, and the presentation holds its appeal, but that's just not enough to make it worthwhile. When I get the itch for something like this, I'll play Nexus Ops or Small World or even Battle Cry.

=======
I'm holding off on rating this one, but my first play was pretty abysmal. We didn't even finish after about 4 hours of play. This is partly due to some rules oddness (why would anyone ever attack a neutral instead of diplomatic blitzing?) and partly due to it not being a good match for certain players in my group. Still, there's some fun stuff in there and the components sure are pretty.

Very fun game with a WWII feel to it. Battles are resolved quickly. Players are rewarded for using combined arms operations and careful commitment of reserves. The rules are sound, although they could be organized a little better (I miss the old AH rule formats). I have only played the game with the expansion as the basic game is too simple for our group. The only negative aspect of the gameplay, is the randomness of the ecomonic card drawing mechanism (players can run into a problem if they come up short on oil cards).

Attack! is my oldest unplayed game. I bought it on 2013 and I never played it. My philosophy is to never sell unplayed games, but I will make an exception here. I have changed a lot since 2013, I no longer enjoy Ameritrash games so my desire to play Attack! is very low. 

Another factor was that the miniatures came with a sprue and I hate that. Taking them out of the sprue is a hassle for me.

Very simple wargame. Only 4 basic units and a pretty elegant combat system. There's an economic system that based on set collection, and a control of the seas mechanism which I don't like so much. But overall, a light fun game thats somewhat on par with M44.

Despite the small board, a lot of space is required for this game because the battles take place off-board. Also, the Diplomatic Blitz action seems to be extremely random, with no way to control the outcome.

Played this with the expansion and 6 players. What an exercise in absolute tedium that was! Probably one of the happiest moments in my life when the game finally ended. I don't appreciate games in which you have to wait for almost an hour (!) before you can play again! (and then someone plays a card that only allows you one action during your turn - and you're starting player, which means you'll have to wait another one and a half hours before it's your turn again? I don't think so!)

Eagle Games has scored again!  I have been boardgaming for years and cut my teeth on games like Risk and Axis &amp; Allies.  Eagle Games set out to create a fun, fast, playable conqueror the world type of game and they succeeded admirably. The basic game is easy to learn, can be played in a few short hours, and changes every time it&#039;s played.  A lot of people are compairing this game to Risk and I think it does Attack! a disservice.  Risk I find to be boring and monotonous.  Axis &amp; Allies (and it&#039;s variants) are fun but become predictable after a few playings. Attack does not seen to fall into either of these pitfalls.  Yes, there are more complicated or more historically accurate games available, but if you just want to have a short, fun game of conqueror the world with a few friends, Attack! is your game.  If you wish for a deeper experience, check out the Attack! Expansion with enhanced naval options and new rules.  I definitely recommend this game to players looking for a new twist on the old war game standbys.

This is one of the first games I played when I started getting into gaming in 2008.  I remember liking the mechanic of using oil for actions.

I don't play these sorts of games much.  I had fun with this on my single play.  The expansion looks cool, but I fear it will slow down the game too much.  Bottomline, I doubt I play this game very much.  UPDATE - so true.  I have traded the game & expansion away.

Good dice rolling war game,4 type of units plus a lot of ships (with the expansion) good strategy,suffer a littl from the rule about oil,because who has got luck in getting oil cards for the conquering of territories will buy a constant advantage who'll grow up after each turn of the game.

The last thing you'd ever want to do in this game is Attack! Worst combat system ever.

It is a long time since i have played this game. Using a friends copy. We all liked it prety good except for the way resources were represented by cards held in hand. rather than geographically. That was easy to fix by puting different colored Risk blocks on the map.

Fun for a game along the lines of Risk. The added elements of diplomacy, trading and economy make it far above the typical game of Risk.

Axis and Allies with slightly more developed diplomatic and economic sub-games?  Sounds like a good idea but, in practice, the extra complexity and play time does not result in a game that is either more realistic or more fun.

Worth playing with the expansion rules but, if you have four or fewer players, forego the temptation to add the Eastern board.  It will only put the players' forces too far apart and reduce the opportunity for immediate conflict.

Sigh...Scorched again by Eagle Games. Although showing more evidence of playtesting than Imperialism and Civilization, they lost a few points for the quality of the plastic pieces, which were definitely not as well formed(but, if you already own A&amp;A, you can just use those pieces). The card-driven economic system is an improvement over A&amp;A. The political cards are also a welcome addition, and allow you to take over a country without needing to conquer it. 

So, in summary, Attack! and its expansion are an improvement over Eagle&#039;s earlier games, but if you already have A&amp;A save your $$ unless you are desperate for something new. If you don&#039;t have A&amp;A, it might be worth it, if only to have all the pieces for a home-brew set of rules.

This is one of those games that you want to like, but it falls short because it's mechanics just don't mesh well. It is a little axis and allies minus history. I think I may have enjoyed it more if the board depicted fictional countries and lands instead of being a map of the world. Dunno.

An honest Risk step-up. For a low price (around 20 EUR) it delivers a plastic blast (680 figures in 4 shapes!!), a sturdy mounted board and 110 cards, plus 8 special dice and 2D6: what more?!

It screams for house-ruling and/or the Deluxe upgrade - if you can still find it (I couldnt). You can't go wrong if you're fine with a plastic&dice totally a-historical fest (there's Axis&Allies for that).

Risk Plus. However, it does lend itself to the same luck-of-the-dice flaw in Risk.  More opportunity for strategy, but still a little lite on deep thought (i.e., some of the strategies you hardly ever get to or even think about using in large games, such as bombing and naval battles.  Games can be long, but if you follow the suggestion of the title and Attack! you should be able to complete a game in one session (a long evening).  Awards:  Origins Best Historical Boardgame (2003).

I used to enjoy Attack! more than I do now, and partly it is because the game's flaws have become more apparent, and partly it is because this Risk-style game has fallen out of favor with me.  I would rather play a hybrid game like Perikles or Mare Nostrum for clever mechanics, or a wargame or Heroscape for the pure combat side.

Attack! has some good mechanics, the best of which is oil translating to actions per turn, and it is decently fun, but it takes too long and it doesn't have that clever mechanic that makes it feel special.  The combat system is also only so-so in my opinion, and that's a crucial feature for a combat heavy game.  Altogether Attack! isn't bad, but it isn't special, and it's a game type that is fading in popularity.

Rating is for the basic game, which is very easy to understand and play, almost immediately.  A well-illustrated rule book also helps. Lots and lots of plastic miniature pieces and a huge, colorful map make this a very attractive game as well. I think it's a good basic game; I take off a half-point because of its relative simplicity. But it's also fun to play with younger kids and to be able to play a wargame fairly quickly. (I also have the Expansion.) In this genre, I prefer "World in War: Combined Arms, 1939-45." Sold, along with Expansion, January 2013.

Good game for people who have time to finish it.Combines a dice battle system, that does a decent job of simulating the weight of WW2 combat, with a good economicail system. The game also starts all players with only small amounts of the map. Some territories start off under no player's control. This makes a sort of race in which you might not even fight your opponent until a good while after the start. 

Just make sure you have dedicated time and people to play with you.

Played with the expansion. The best of Risk (i.e. freewheeling setup and alliances)with the best of A&amp;A (plastic pieces, nice map, WWII units and atmosphere). The political action cards and the numerous technology cards by themselves put this way ahead of either A&amp;A or Risk. I can&#039;t understand those who would say it&#039;s basically the same as A&amp;A. Just read the rules Eagle posted yourself and see if you agree, I think you&#039;ll quickly determine it&#039;s a different (and better) game. This game will never be decided alone by who takes Karellia! The expanded map is 5&#039;X 2&#039;, you&#039;ll need a big table for that. My only criticism is that there&#039;s very little difference to my eyes between the regular size units and the &quot;large&quot; ones representing 5 of same. I&#039;m going to use red and white chips like A&amp;A does to represent extra units. Best Eagle game so far.

I still class this as an unofficial Risk variant. Set in WWII, it takes Risk to the next level and might be considered as a gateway game for those who have been raised on Risk but are fearful of more complex war games. It has some of the same defects as Risk, and it is quite a long game. For more experienced gamers, it is probably best played with the expansion.

I've played a three-player and a four-player game, neither with the expansion.  The problem with this one is that most of its mechanisms are are a blend of Axis and Allies and Risk, and still takes 2.5 to 3 hours to feel as if you've played it enough.  Take a country, you get a card, which is used to create units.  Land battles, like Risk, are to the death, but use dice conceived by Richard Borg in Battle Cry (or probably earlier).  There are different units, as in Axis and Allies, but they are somewhat character-less.  

In essence, it's practically an abstract wargame, like Risk.  The problem with such is that it takes forever to get interesting, and although it's somewhat fun, I prefer more engaging systems than this.  I give it a 5 not because it's not fun, but the time commitment would be better spent playing something more enjoyable for me, like Republic of Rome or Game of Thrones...

Have the expansion (not the deluxe version) and we play with interleaved turns (everyone plays round 1 for 1 Oil, round 2 for 2 oil, etc.) and the game is great.  Still haven't found a good set of rules for a satisfying ending.

So, I guess by itself, with Rules-As-Written, the game isn't all that great.  But with a few house rules and the expansion, this is my favorite beer-and-pretzels war game.

Shares many features of games of this ilk - build up forces, then expand to take territory.  The rich get richer, while the poor get poorer.  That said, the economic cards add a nice randomizer to building forces as production gained for conquests and defeats are now more variable.  Naval battle abstracted, but probably needs the expansion to be truly enjoyed.  Still a long playing time, and repeated conflicts via die rolls the heart of the game.

[b][thing=6752][/thing][/b] and [b][thing=35276][/thing][/b] were designed by [b][company=597][/company][/b] to build on Risk.

I like the differentiated unit types (infantry, tank, artillery, air) and the sea units (battleship, carrier, destroyer, sub).

Throw in economic aspects of oil, resources and factories and you have territories that mean something.

Personally, I also like the aspects that the expansion bring in, namely politics (fascist, monarchial, democratic, communist), espionage and a tech tree and I think it's one of the best games in the Risk genre.

But, I think the best achievement was that they added all that in without seriously slowing down or overcomplicating the basic underpinnings of Risk.

This is a real good Conquer-the-World game, much better than Risk, which is sooo boring.

What an elegant, fun, little wargame. Mechanics are very elegant including the combat and the use of the special dice. What is best about this game is the large number of options available each turn and you are limited to 3. This seems to take a hint from the recently successful German games. Though the rules are relatively simple, trade, diplomatic blitzes, uncertainty when conquering territory, a proper battle line, unit formation, and many other factors will play a part in whether your &quot;attack!&quot; is truly successful. An added bonus is the replayability. Looking forward to trying the expansion.

One of the better games to come from Eagle.  I like some of their games, I don&#039;t like others, but I really enjoy this one.  Should really only be played with the expansion as that adds a lot of great elements to the game.  Another cool thing I have always complained about in war games that sets this apart: I was actually able to fend off all possible attacker with my navy alone!  By controling the seas I was actually able to defend myself without having to use a lot of troops.

Wow, this game has a ton of gameplay to offer.  My only previous wargame experience was Risk, so when I sunk my teeth into this I came away wanting more!  Lots of different strategies available, including sea battles which can drastically affect the outcome.

RATING: 4
[1 play] You will learn no history here. You will gain no understanding of geography, warfare, politics, or economics. OK, that's fine, but if it is fun, then that is what is important, right? So, is it fun? Well, there's more here than Risk, which means it'll be good for kids, but not a ton of fun and thinking for adults.

Finally, a couple notes, since this is yet another Eagle Games production. The slightly different sized units meant to represent a 1 unit value and a 5 unit value is an ill-advised concept. When not next to each other, they are not readily distinguished. The naval rules for this game were either hastily added or the result of some very foggy thinking.  The drive to produce nice looking games is admirable, but [UPDATE] it seems like Eagle is learning with experience to get help with concepts and rules and find better playtesters. Hopefully the future games will continue to get better. It's too late for Attack! however.

Most recent play in late 2004 with Garrett.

A hybrid of Risk and Axis & Allies. I like the combat system, which incorporates the advantages of combined arms and the blitzkrieg potential of tanks and planes. Unfortunately, the naval rules are overly abstracted and the way economics cards switch back and forth is a little nutty. I would recommend playing to a certain point value, rather than player elimination or time limits.

The game seems to consist mainly of a land grab. Beyond that there is little in the way of mechanisms except for a dicefest. My initial impressions after one trial round was poor.

I can't believe so many people rate this game so highly.  It must be because of all the people that like Axis and Allies. 

SLOW! I don't remember if I played with the expansion or not. I was looking for something to do at a convention, so I tried this.  The group took a break after two hours; however, I had not yet got to make my first move!  

SCARY! Here's the kicker:  I met someone at another game convention that set the game up at 5PM, started the game an hour or two later, and didn't get his first turn until midnight -- and he wasn't even the final player!

When combined with the expansion, I rate this game a 9.  However, on its own, it is an incomplete game.  In particular, the "Control of the Sea" rules for naval dominance are highly unbalanced.  If you have the expansion but don't want to dive into all the expansion rules right off the bat, do yourself a favour and play my extreme "Attack!" makeover: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/310177.  So if you are into this type of game, do get it, but definitely pick up the expansion too.  Or better yet, wait for "Attack! Deluxe" to be released.

The best one yet from Eagle and once played you wont go back to Risk or A&amp;A. Good simple rules, fun gameplay and it is pretty quick for such a rewarding game.

An interesting take on turning Risk in to a true strategy game. Attack! incorporates economic manipulation, political ideaology, and action cost components to make for an interesting game. It still retains a bit of the dice-fest feel of Risk (good and bad) and can still be a bit long for my tastes but it is definitely an interesting game that I wouldn't mind playing now and then.  
One note - When I played we incorporated a house rules that a turn comprised of each player taking one action and then allowing the next player to take one action and so on. The cost of actions would increase one point each round until all players passed. For me, this proved to be much more interactive and helped keep my interest over the prescribed method of one player taking all his actions and having the other players sit and watch for 10 minutes doing nothing unless attacked.

I have control of the sea?  That's how you determine who has initial control of the sea?  Very poor design and it seems like sea combat was thought of the night before publication.

This game comes with a very big board that has the ability to fit all of your pieces that you have in that territory you control, which I find very pleasing.  I like the strategy aspect as well, where it is hard to overwhelm the enemy with infantry, or an all tank army; having a balance to each squadron is the key.  The battle system is good to for both land and navel, but I tend to lean more toward the navel card battle aspect.  When teaching this game to other people, they seem to catch on quickly and it is easy for them to learn.  Having the Attack! Expansion is a must; having the other half of the map is always a good idea.  I defiantly would suggest and recommend this game.

Only played this with the expansion. Out of the box this game has some problems, even if it has some good ideas (seems like a common Eagle issue). I'd play this again but only with some house rules.

My husband bought this game and I expect never to play it. Though there is a small chance I might, if its economic aspects can overcome my general disinterest in wargames.

This game loses points for the way the sea stuff works, and maybe a little because it is only half the map.  No point in playing just half a world, I say.

An interesting WWII grand strategy game here. It resembles Axis and Allies in some parts, while in others it's completely different. While there are some really nice ellements within the game, my gaming group quickly lost interest in this.

Really like the mechanics to this.  Fixes what is wrong with Axis and Allies and Risk.  The die rolls are even and force you to have a balanced army rather than a cheesy tank army.  There is no bonus for continents so it allows you to consolidate your army early on so no one gets stuck surrounded on all sides. And, the person who early into the game secures Australia or South Africa does not get any bonuses.  Having one person own the sea at any time and therefore control trades and sea movement is a very powerful position and makes the game much more interesting.  I also like the fact that empty terratories are not free!  Another good aspect is: on your turn you can do 3 actions and there are 7 different types so production is not a given and you have to resource plan better.  I highly recommend this game!

A simple game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era though not intended to be a historical simulation of the era.
Each player will start with a few regions, and a few military units. He will expand his power base by adding regions to his "sphere of influence". This may be done either through diplomacy, or military conquest. Map covers America's, Europe and Africa.

This game is great fun. Cool components, clever and easy to use rules and a high replaying factor.
I also can highly recommend the "Attack! EXPANSION" which adds a lot of depth but at the same time doesn't make the game too complex.

if you like Risk, then this might be better...
if you don't like Risk but you do like "dudes-on-a-map", this is ok...
if you think "ok" isn't enough, get the expansion...
if you absolutley know you want this, skip directly to the new Deluxe version...
I traded mine to seek better "dudes-on-a-map" games...

Barely a risk contender on its own. Though there are some neat options, some clever game mechanics and a dynamic feel push this toward the top of the "Risk/Supremacy" pyramid. The expansion is almost required. It improves the game so much, it's worth  the investment. Bumps up to 7.5/10 with the expansion.

A cool idea for the combat system, but like other Eagle games, it just doesn't seem to have been playtested enough.  With some variant rules, it could become a pretty cool game, but out of the box, the turns take too long, and the game doesn't seem to be well balanced.

I was expecting a better version of Risk and I was disappointed.  I hated cutting out all of the tiny pieces and the naval battles made no damn purpose.  It ended up being that we were in a stand still because no one could cross the sea to attack on their turn because the naval commander kept swapping each turn.

The problem here is why should I play this game over other "conquest the world" games? Even if the production quality is high, and there are some nice touches (as the dice used in combat), available strategies are very limited.

I bought this along with several other German card games, and this is my favourite of the lot.

There are certainly shades of games like 6 Nimmt: you're playing cards to rows and generally not trying to play cards that will make you take other cards. Okay, that's been done a lot. The twist is that the cards are a bunch of different colours, and you're trying to get a small number of many colours, instead of a larger number of few colours. And that tweak means a lot. Picture a game like 6 Nimmt, except all the cards were different colours, and getting 1 or 2 cards of a colour give you positive points and 3 gives you negative. Not the same thing but may help you to imagine the feeling one has when playing the game. It's a nice extra dimension.

The only reason I don't rate it higher is because others haven't liked it quite as much as I do.

While I prefer 6 Nimmt, this is definitely easier to set up when playing with low player counts (I refuse to use the whole deck in 6 Nimmt unless I'm playing with at least 5 or 6 players).

I'm not sure if I'd choose it over 6 Nimmt, but I'll happily play it.

I enjoyed it. I was told I would like 6 nimmt which everyone agreed is better than this. I love little interesting card games, but this one was a bit TOO heavy on the luck, which is saying something for a game this light.

It is in the same vein of 6 Nimmt! that works fine with 2, 3 or 4 players.
Good twist in the set collection: you need to collect 1 or 2 but not 3 cards of each colour. With a set of 3 cards those cards are negative points and you need to start over collecting that colour.
The colour choice is really bad in this game. With bad lighting could be difficult to discern and would drive to frustration. 

I like it but wife didn't.

Hey, cooles Spiel, gefällt mir, auch wenn ich es offensichtlich nicht kann! Vermutlich lag es aber einfach am Kartenpech, JA! genau das wars :)

Der Groschen ist gefallen. beim zweiten Spiel hatte ich nicht eine Karte zu viel. Die Kunst liegt darin nicht zu früh und nicht zu spät mit dem sammeln anzufangen. Die 5 bzw. 2 Punkte die die anderen mehr hatten, nur weil sie als erster 7 Farben hatten, waren dahin nachdem sie noch mehr von der Farbe nehmen mussten :).

Habe das Spiel auf der Spiel 2015 getestet. Mein Fazit nach dieser einen Partie:  Ein Kartenablegespiel, dass mich vom Spielgefühl etwas an 6-Nimmt erinnert hat. Nur, dass ich in diesem Spiel gerne genau 2 Karten jeder Farbe bekommen möchte. Eine wäre auch okay, aber wie der Titel schon sagt sind 3 eine zu viel. 
War okay und ich würde auch nochmals mitspielen, aber ich persönlich bin nicht der ganz große Fan dieser Art von Spielen und wenn schon, dann ist mir 6-Nimmt als "Original" schon lieber.
Aber wer gerne 6-Nimmt spielt, findet hier vielleicht eine nette Variante, die auf Grund der entstehenden Zwängen nicht ohne Reiz ist.

RATING: 6.7
A curious case... Superficially similar to 6 nimmt!, but really much more of an exercise in careful hand management. I'm not sure that enough cards come out with two players and I'm also uncertain that barring terrible luck you're put under enough angst (I came up one card short of a perfect score my very first play), but it's a clever and fun short card game all the same.

Simple card game that reminded me a lot of 6 nimmt!. You are playing cards (not at the same time) and collecting the cards that you knock off. You want 2 of a color but more than that each set of 3 turns over for minus points. It is a neat little game. I can't say much was special about it. I would rather play 6 Nimmt. Definitely easy enough.

--Feb2017-- Intriguing, in a [thing=432]6 nimmt![/thing]-y way.  (Or, it's not clear that a perfectly random player would necessarily lose each time out.)  I expect there's some understanding of the card color distribution that we were missing, but even allowing for that, there's at least a couple viable card-collection paradigms here that might be right; so it was fun to experiment.

[Amigo 2015 Edition] {Abstract; hand management; optimal 3-4p} Originally, I didn't plan to buy this game but after reading the rules and reviews.  It is a tactical game for fewer number of players for 6 Nimmt! Great.

Players need to make smart moves in this game to collect the cards they want.  The card distribution is nicely design; players usually can make smart move to collect different colours.  A hand of all low / high cards will not hurt you.

The colour choice is really bad in this game.  We need to collect cards of 7 colors, but some colors are too similar in low light and their illustration doesn't help much to differentiate those cards.  Amigo shall be able to do better job than this.

Echoes of Parade. Play cards to a shared display, sometimes picking up cards that score. Unlike Parade - sometimes you want these cards, sometimes you don't. A tricky puzzle of a game.

RATING: 6.8
tl;dr: heavier than expected

Most Amigo card games are pretty light to ultra light and fast. This one is not as fast. In fact, it's pretty thinky! You want to make sure to get all 7 colors in your tableau, but if you get 2 of each card too early in the game, you're going to loose a good amount of points later in the game. So the timing is essential. It's a nice puzzle to solve.
Repeated plays should tell me how good this is, but for now, I can say: it's good enough to own and play.

This game translates to "Three is one too many!". It's a card game that doesn't look like much to the untrained eye.

The game has three card rows. One reserved for 1-29, one for 30-59 and one for 60-99. You start with a hand of cards and the round continues until you've placed all but two. You play two rounds. On your turn you put a card into a card row. (They're placed in order low to high, left to right) If it isn't the fourth card in that row, nothing happens. If it is, you take one or more cards. If you place the highest number in the row, you take the lowest numbered card in the row. If it's not the highest number, you take all the higher number cards.

Cards come in 7 different colors and one neutral non-color. The cards you take go into a tableau in front of you. You want to end the game with pairs of every color. Each pair is worth 5 points. Each singleton is worth 1 point. If you take more than 2, those cards flip over and count a point each against you... but you can restart that color from scratch again.

There's bonuses for getting 7 colors on your tableau... it's a race as the later bonuses decrease in value. Additionally, there's a bonus for ending the game with 6 or 7 colors in your tableau.

This game is really thinky! You'll often have a real bind as you don't want to play a card that will force you to take a third card of a color. And your card distribution may force you to play one card row more than the others, which can hurt.

I really enjoyed this one. When I was watching it being played, I didn't give it much credit and couldn't appreciate how difficult it was. When I actually sat down to play it, oh boy did it pin me to the wall and start turning the screws. There's a lot of game here.

Another one of those simple-looking card games that seem to get so easily lost in the crowd of games. This one has been interesting to explore and I think it is a worthwhile filler - one I'll be hanging on to for the tactics it allows.

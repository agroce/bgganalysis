Supply rules are easier than in QG: V or D. Clear advantage. Also this seems to be a little more asymmetric which I find nice. I am not entirely sure wheter I like prepare cards more in this or in V or D. Both have their advantages.

I am finding that my mileage with the QMG series is very limited.  1914 is probably the best of the bunch in its efforts to simulate its subject and to refine the base system.  Yet a sense of deja vu has set in. 

Artwork and production quality are both very good.  The miniatures are a step up from those in Victory or Death.

The prepared cards give a nice twist compared to original Quartermaster General. On the other hand, the different nations in one fraction deck increase the complexity of play for these players. From this and the original version, I prefer the original.

RATING: 7.5
On the one hand, this game feels like it has the potential to be an amazing game. A team-based asymmetric game with multi-use cards? That sounds amazing and it basically is. It even has low rules overhead, above-average production quality, and tons of interaction...all things I love. But the flip side of this coin is this really should be played with exactly 5 players and, being a card-driven game, requires multiple plays to understand the decks and truly unlock the game's potential. Those requirements are going to relegate this game to niche groups which is unfortunate.

Much like it's predecessor, this is a quick-moving, easy-to-play, war-style game that I enjoyed with a few others. It's also team game that takes place a few decades before the original version of this game. Nothing special, but an interesting play.

Up to date - best installment of Quartermaster General series. Easy to grasp rules, but gameplay gives enough headache, given its short time. "Sandbox" type of game (getting some countries into play, axes of main advances, etc.), very high replayability, good historicity level (especially grinding and attritional nature of Great War). And, last but not least, great amount of fun.
Excellent game.

Another brilliant re-implementation of QM for five players.

Unique, different than both QM+expansions and Victory or Death, and strategically deep and tactically engaging. 

Everyone in our group loved it from the start!

A nice, different follow up to Quartermaster General.  The core mechanics are the same, but remarkably this feels very much like World War 1.  The game play is more static, compared with the fluid parent game.  Cards must be prepared well in advance to plan offensives, and every space taken feels like a major achievement.  Fantastic design.  Really liked it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very similar to its parent but has a few rule changes which make things even more exciting. A card has two uses now and they may be laid down in front of you as an additional free action. These cards use an icon at the bottom of the card. Some of these icons are responses to attacks and will defeat an enemy attack if you reveal one...unless the enemy reveals a pre-played card which maintains the attack. And so we get into a situation whereby you never know if a player can fend off your attack, so there is a degree of bluff and secret abilities. Playing cards aside to use later in this manner is essential, but your decks are thin so you can’t overdo it.

The game also only scores every third turn (ie after 15 player turns) rather than after every player’s move. Therefore you don’t have that rather fiddly scoring system from the original.

It all adds up to a great package and a must for Quartermaster General fans. It plays with five too so a little easier to find a group for than the six-player original.

I'm a recent convert to the QMG system. I'm impressed at how this system can render such interesting decisions with such little rules overhead. Funny story, but the first time I saw the WWII version was at the WBC being demo'd by the designer. I walked up to the table and he was showing how a "Land Battle!" card provoked a land battle and a piece was removed -- and I turned and walked away without stopping (ever see the "Simpsons" episode where Grandpa walks into the brothel, sees Bart, then immediately walks back out all in one motion?). It just seemed insipid. 

But I tried the WWII version and thought it was better than I expected. Much better. At the following WBC, the designer demo'd the VoD: Peloponnesian version for me in the store and I was sufficiently impressed with the different types of card play to buy an impulse copy. I was also impressed to hear that the WWII expansions added some sophistication to match the VoD version. Turns out VoD has been a resounding success with my group. We've had some pitched battles and everyone who's played it has liked it and wants to play again.

So as both a budding fan of the QMG system and a huge fan of WWI (I’ve read a lot and listened to Dan Carlin’s 20+ hour podcast), the 1914 version certainly caught my eye. I was pleasantly surprised to see people saying it’s the best one of the system. I wanted to play VoD till bored and then get 1914, but I threw it on a pending CSI order one night. So glad I did that! Side note: it’s nice when you hit on impulse purchases, isn’t it?

So all that context is to explain how I got here with the system and to substantiate my admiration for this game (and game system). What makes 1914 so good is that the face-down Preparation cards of VoD are expanded upon here. Now, when you attack, the attack isn’t necessarily automatic. The defender can flip over a face-down card to use its shield symbol on the bottom to thwart the attack. But wait, the attacker can then flip a face-down arrow symbol to sustain the offensive. And then the defender can react again, etc., until one side cannot match the other and they win the battle. Moreover, if the defender thwarted the attack and has a face-down counterattack symbol, he can launch a free attack. 

In addition to those abilities of the Preparation cards, you can also bleed each other of cards. In a recent game, both A-H/Turkey (me) and Germany ran out of cards before the game ended. We still managed to hang on and win due to the lead we’d built. 

This system is predicated on the mechanism whereby you can play one card on your turn – and then prepare a facedown card. That one card decision is agonizing between playing an event, a build unit, an attack, or a status card (for additional scoring). The ratio of depth to rules overhead is way in favor of the former which makes this such a winner.

After a couple plays, I still don't know how I like it compared to the original QMG. While the preparation of the cards clearly adds bluffing and thus tension, I am worried that too many countries are very limited in their options (the Ottoman Empire and Italy, mainly). In each of the two games, at least one player was frustrated that they couldn't do much, which I felt could only happen with Japan in the original game.

I don't know if the feeling will disappear as we get more familiar with the game but I'll be cautious before offering to play it again.

My game arrived with a torn map. Hoping to have it replaced soon. I need also to report that the cards need sleeving, little handling just to count them revealed their fragility. 

The game looks fantastic otherwise, and I'm sure it is going to be a blast to play.

UPDATE
First play revealed a tense, anxiety-inducing game of gritty attrition. I believe the system shines in portraying the tense battles in the trenches, a great deal more than its WW2 predecessor. At the end of our game all the countries involved where on their knees, I could really love this game! :)

UPDATE
I am at my 5th match. Awesome game! I am currently obsessed by this and have bumped the rating to '9' accordingly. :)

UPDATE
After 8 games without a single Entente win, we decided to try to 'crack' the game, by playing in two. Two games and we had two Entente victories!

Wow, now this is one of my favorite games!!! 

I can't give it a 10 yet, till they don't substitute the torn map which arrived after the KS campaign.

UPDATE
Map arrived. 10 for this game! :)

UPDATE
I played this game 20 times now. There is a learning curve regarding how to play the Entente. Now I see that the game is a little more balanced than I thought initially having the CP won the vast majority of our games. There is a luck element to this game. If you get the cards you need, in the sequence you need, there is no stopping you. So the Germans can get to Paris and it is a true miracle if the French and UK can keep them at bay. All in all there is a lot of tension and some historical facts play out in front of your eyes. The Gallipoli landing. The defiant Serbs and the landing in Salonika by the Entente to come to their rescue. The fall of the great empire of Russia. The battle of Jutland. Only each one of these events can go differently, succeed or fail. 

The one thing that I don't think the game models too well is the arrival of the US. It requires considerable effort on the UK player in order to do so, and to little overall effect.

UPDATE
Fascinating game, I just can't get enough. This was, for me, the best game of 2016.

You can fold the map in an envelope and mail it back to Mongolia. Lesson to learn: Don't try to make psudo Axis and Allies games without including tons of sculpts and a huge map.

A clever iteration on the original Quartermaster General. The new prepare mechanic means cards have two potential ways of influencing the game, and they also make attacks more suspenseful and risky. 

The asymmetry is even more pronounced this time about with three of the five player decks split across two nations, each with separate cards. Germany is a beast. Roles are heavily guided by the event and status cards, to the point where it borders on stifling. 

Overall, I enjoyed more than the WWII version thanks to the added depth of preparation and attrition. Based on the heavy-handed role enforcement, I don't think it's one that I'll add to my collection, but I'd be happy to play again from time to time.

Limited range of strategies. If your capital city is conquered (which, if you are playing with the French, it's relatively easy), you're out of the game for quite some time, which is not funny. Playing with two nations also limits your hand management, because one country's cards cannot be used by the other country's troops. This is especially bad for the French player because the Italian cards are few and weak.

November 2017 (7.5): I’ve changed my opinion. Played it two more times, and have come to appreciate the design much more.

After one play (6). I enjoyed the prepared cards, but the game basically devolved into Germany vs. The Rest (with Austria as a puppet state). Might be historically accurate, but Germany was so overpowered that it wasn't much fun to play. Enjoyed the WWII-version more, where the countries seem to be more balanced. Would like to give this one another chance though.

Even though original supply rules have been ditched this is less straightforward and possibly more scripted than the original. There is less weird and totally unexpected stuff happening. Comes with some very good modifications to the system: scoring not happening every turn leads to tighter games, prepare function helps to create the stalemate of WWI and semi mulligan for getting Build cards helps with the luck of the draw.

RATING: 7
When the original Quartermaster General came out, which covers WWII in its entire scope, I give it a pass without a pause.  My thinking was that I won't be interested in such a highly abstracted strategic level wargame in which there is no dice to roll for movement or combat!  I said I wouldn't be interested in the system at all.  Later when Victory or Death is released to cover an epic ancient struggle between Athenian and Spartan with the same game engine,  the system again come to my attention because this campaign is my top interest in ancient history since Mark Herman's masterpiece (Victory Games) Peloponessian War.  Since then I read a lot of materials in that campaign.  Shortly after Victory or Death (I even don't have the time to play it), Quartermaster General: 1914 is released in October 2016 at Essen game fair.  My friend Angus brought the Kickstarter version directly back from the fair and in no time, we set up a game to begin play.  In a single day, we are able to play 2.5 games in about 6 hours on first play.  It's always good to have a strategic game that can cover the whole World War I and be completed in such a short time, while the gameplay is still considered meaty somewhat and meaningful.  Quartermaster General: 1914 is such a game.  
   
There are 216 cards and 5 player aids for each of the major powers, US/UK, France/ Italy, Russia on the Entente side, Germany and Austria-Hungry on the other Central Power side.  According to the historical characteristics of the participating powers, the cards are allocated in different number to seven different types of cards.  By playing the seven cards in hand, maximizing the resources and chances, a player can experience the difficult, sometime agonizing decisions that the head of the power nation went through.  Some of the cards are either historically too early to play, or that they are not complement to the current situation on the map.  The game engine is one of card-driven that many of us know quite well nowadays with the influx of such design.  

However, the cards are not used for operation points like other CDGs does.  Instead, the card types determine the action the power can take in a turn.  To initiate an attack, you need a land battle card.  Likewise, a sea battle card for attack in a sea area.  To build army or navy in a vacant area, you need a build army or build navy card. Effectively one builds to occupy and control victory point areas (denoted with a star).  Wargame grognards would find it odd to see that an attack always succeeds to remove an enemy army or navy, as long as the attacking piece is in supply and the enemy doesn't have the reinforce card, previously "prepared" during his own player turn "Prepare" step.  The cards are prepared face-down and so there is a sense of fog going on the attack.  Attack into difficult terrain ("area") costs an additional card to discard from hand as extra effort/ resource spent with the attack.    

The Turn Sequence is nicely laid out in the Player Aid card.  So the players can always refer to it and know what to do next.  Each turn begins with Draft Step, which allows the player to discard two cards in hand in order to find a Build card from the deck.  This means drafting the army or navy in a "mobilized" manner.   The player then play a card from his hand to effect the type of card or what is written on the card.  

For example, an "Event" card might confer multiple actions to the player with historical event like Italian "Isonzo River Offensives", with which by discarding a card from the hand as resources, an Italian Army is built in the Italian Alps area, then initiate a battle into Tyrol with it.  Similarly, the Russian has Brusilov Offensive, the French has Plan 17 and the German has Schlieffan Plan, each of which dictates battle to specified area or among many.  A "Status" card, on the other hand, confers benefits or advantages for sustained effect lasting several turns to the Power which are historically known for.  The German would have Stosstruppen tactics (discard a prepared Sustain Land Battle card and then initiate an attack with a newly raised army), mustard gas (discard opponent's one card in the "prepared" deck), while the French would have Marne and Verdun to discard a "prepared" card of the Central Power if it attacks into Picardy and Burgundy respectively.  The cards replicates the historically well-prepared French positions in these areas as a result.  Mind you, even Rasputin has an effect on Russia in the war.....

As mentioned several times in the previous paragraph, the concept of "prepared" deck is crucial to the nature of WWI: attrition. During the "Attrition" step, a player can reveal one of the "prepared" card, which is hidden face-down, in prior turn and target another Power, as specified by the color of the "skulls", to discard the number of cards from hand, as required by the number of "skull" icons on the bottom of the "prepared" card.  For a single "skull" on the card, you can target any one Power who has an army in an adjacent area.  Another type of card "Economic Warfare" causes a lot of attrition to the other side of the Power.  A look at the Player Aid you can find the German has the highest number of Economic Warfare cards with 9, while UK/US come by the second with 6.  A horrible card is Germany's "Unrestricted Submarine Warfare". It would cause three attrition (i.e., three cards discard) to the UK/US player and two more attrition for each Sea Battle card that Germany discard from the current hand.  What's more, Germany gains one VP immediately.  Fortunately, a similar card the UK/ US has is "UK Seizes German Colonies in Africa", if the UL has 3 or more navies on the map.        

The player's role is therefore one of a very high level - you can allocate the resources between hand and prepared deck, timing your attacks and events to the best possible moment to occupy, to advance or to cause attrition.  If you manage them well in a coordinated fashion, you will have a better chance of winning.  Victory points are mainly accumulated through occupation of objectives, plus the objective tokens, on the map.  A side can earn a Sudden Victory if the difference of VPs between two sides exceeds 12 or more, as gauged along the VP track at the edge of the map-board.  Victory points are scored 5 times in a game every four turns.  Otherwise, the game completes at turn 17 with the victory going to the side with highest VPs at the time.   

Speaking of map-board, it is a hard-mounted map reminiscent of the good old times where every Avalon Hill game produces with a thick cardboard.  The card art evokes the WWI feel of the era and the back of the card is printed with national flags for easy identification.  The quality of the miniatures are good enough to give rise to nostalgia of everyone's childhood, when playing toy soldiers can spend one's whole day without any regret. 

Overall, the game is highly playable with easy rules, carefully crafted cards, rigid but very clearly logical and streamlined game sequence (you can see that there is only five steps in a player's round or turn).  Once you get a hang of it, the game speeds up while people can concentrate on gameplay and negotiations among the allies.  Yes, that also plays a part in the game as coordinated sequence is superior to the one that is not as timing of playing the cards from your hand matters. Quartermaster General: 1914 is also a very re-playable game as each player can play different side each time in a 5-players game and experience different narratives and strategies.  If you can find the right group and sufficient number of people, the game is definite more value-for-money at Kickstarter price $46.

This is an excellent adaptation of the Quartermaster General mechanic. The game has nice, realistic pace which reflects the history of the war. At the beginning not all countries are deployed on the board (Italy, US, Turkey) and as these gradually join and the other protagonists build-up their forces there is a sense of "lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time". Conflict is more fluid in the early game but gradually becomes more static and tense as players build up their tableaux of status and prepare cards.and have to make decisions about when and where to make the 'big push'. The greater emphasis on prepare cards with the attrition, sustain and counter-attack abilities introduces a far greater element of bluffing to battles and attrition can be a really powerful way of degrading your enemies ability to wage war. A really impressive game!

I'm impressed how flexible the Quartermaster system is.  1914 has more depth than its predecessors since cards can be played in a couple of different ways. Now you can tuck away cards for future use to help you defend, keep attacking, or make your opponent discard cards (during the Attrition Phase).

Simple and quick WW1 game where cards are used both to take war actions and to simulate the unability to continue the war (as you run out of cards). The idea is interesting but luck with cards can make or break the game and the uneven player powers, although historically correct, make the experience less fun for the weaker ones. Also, the endgame can be quite stale when all players have run out of cards and only wait for the final round. As Russia, I only got to play two build/defend cards and saw two more removed by powerful German cards before I was eliminated and yet the game dragged on to the last round before the Central Powers won.

The Quartermaster General system is used for WW I, with the Germans and Austria Hungary/Ottoman powers as the Central powers. The Entente powers are made up of France/Italy, US/UK and Russia. Each deck has different cards and each power has different powers. The Germans and Austria Hungary are outnumbered but they have the more powerful decks, especially compared to France/Italy who can be weak.

The rule changes from the other Quartermaster General games is that you draw 10 cards, then put 3 back at the bottom of your draw pile. You only score up to 5 times in the game. Here you can prepare a card, and preparing a card allows you to  use that card later for attrition, extending a battle, or for defence. 

It's a fun system and Ian Brody has done well to expand the original game system. I'm starting to enjoy this very much, and I think it is the best of the Quartermaster General series.

Completely different game as QMG WW2. Gone are the fast movements and expansion. Every battle is difficult to prepare and play. The cards are multi-use now in earnest, you really need to see what you take and what you let go. The cards do not go away in the first turn, a problem with QMG novices who could screw their games in the first turn. Here, this is mellowed somewhat. Supply is not deadly anymore, so a much more positional game emerges (fitting).

All in all, an excellent change for me. It is, however, more suited to the WWI aficionados due to the slower overall pace. Prepare to unlearn your WW2 tricks and go into a new experience. Highly recommended.

The game mechanics for this differ slightly from the original game but the most important feature of this game is the fact that it is optimised for five players. With the original game (optimised for 6) and Victory or Death (optimised for 4), we are just awaiting an iteration of QMG that is optimised for three (all can be played by two, albeit with varying degrees of satisfaction). I suggested a viable three-power war to Ian Brody but I don't know if he'll pursue tat or come up with another option - but I'm pretty sure a three-player QMG will be the next to appear.

First impression is that QG1914 is one of the best multiplayer WW1 games available. Lots of tense choices, a very stubborn Serbia, offenses back and forth over Poland.

So, I have three plays in, and others played another close match last week. This is a keeper, for several reasons. One is that each country or country pair plays quite differently. Another is that planning for campaigns really works, but so does quick improv - my being a little slow meant my UK coup in Greece got narrowly preempted by an AUSTRIAN coup in Greece, and having to move a fleet into the East Med telegraphed another failed landing in Gallipoli. And each country can play differently - I've seen Germany win with a heavy economic warfare focus, I've seen it run West, and it has gone East. The US can be critical, or dang near comatose like my last game. And Serbia is amazingly (and accurately) stubborn, with little in the way of special rules needed. Nice pieces from PSC too. 

TL, DR: Jury's back - guilty on all counts - of fun.

Reduced rating to 8. Repeated play reveals narrow strategic options. Game becomes mainly about hand management as the optimal choices on the board are obvious. 

==========================================================

Deepens and elaborates the excellent Quartermaster General system. The use of prepare cards to reinforce battles adds a welcome new dimension to the game. Economic warfare and attrition are now major weapons. Even with new elements, this is still a game you can learn and play in minutes. Really a remarkable achievement.

Once again, the factions play dramatically differently and have suitably historic roles. As with the other games in the system, I immediately want to play again to try new powers. Difficult to image another system bringing WW1 to the table in 90 minutes with this much texture and fun. 

However, as with the other entries in the system, this is a game where you will be remorselessly violated by your opponents. Card actions are powerful and often devastating. Knowing the decks is vital. This is a game (and system) best played with a regular group who learn the decks and powers together.

Light, WWI game that is cleverly designed. Feels more like a dudes on a map game than a wargame. The rules are very simple, but the way that the cards themselves promote the feel of WWI and its history is impressive. Probably the lightest WWI game that I know of that still feels like WWI.

A solid variation from the original Quartermaster. I haven't played enough to know if it's as good as its elder brother but so far I see them as roughly equal. I think I enjoy the original more but that's partly because I like the mobility of WW2 more than the trench warfare of WW1. QG1914 does offer its own unique pleasures, including some bluffing and ambushing possibilities.

Received as a Xmas gift, 2017. Played twice before New Year's Day.

Solid game, but not terribly intuitive.  Most of the people I played with were already wargamers, so the 'attack but no auto followup' kind of messed with them a little, along with the importance of expansion.

First game (while I was playing both Central powers) was an Entente win by 4 points.  The second game (while I was playing the UK/US) was an Entente sudden victory by 16 points in the next-to-last scoring round.

A heavier and slower take on the excellent QMG mechanics. This is going to take some time to fully digest and to work on optimum tactics, but I'm looking forward to playing and learning. It is great to have a Great War grand strategy game that can be played fairly quickly, and I was keen to play a second game as soon as we finished the first, which is always a good sign.

All is not a bed of roses, I do have some complaints about the components, though. I'm a little disappointed by the generic miniatures, and I would have preferred to have some variants for the French, Russian, Italian, and Ottoman army figures. On top of this, the similarity in colour between the Austrian and Ottoman minis seems very odd, as they are quite difficult to tell apart. I'm rectifying this by subbing in some 1:72 scale plastic soldiers, but should I really have to do that?

I'm also a bit disappointed that the card stock doesn't seem as good as that used in the original QMG game. After one play I noticed some card warping, and I suspect the cards will need sleeving in the longer term. There's a lack of individuality in the artwork on the cards, with a British soldier image being used on the Build Army cards for all nations, which is a shame. It would have been possible to use a wealth of copyright-free images of posters used at the time for enlisting (e.g. the famous Kitchener image) for all of the nations, which would have given greater variety to the art and provided greater immersion, in my opinion. But maybe I am being overly picky?

A final moan about the Kickstarter stretch components - whilst the metal helmets work well, the metal chevron doesn't fit on the turn track, so isn't a great deal of use. The mousemat and poster are perfectly nice, but a little superfluous.

Reading back, the above seems quite negative, but I do actually like the game a great deal, and I think it could well be one of my favourite games released this year, but I'm just striving for perfection here. Perhaps a reprint could vary up the card art and the minis - in the meantime I intend to home-brew mine, as the game deserves it.

It was quite hard game, there are cards, which you should probably more or less know before the game. Not just your own cards, but cards of other nations as well. Might get better with several plays, if it plays still under two hours.

I thought the first try, for me and a few others at any rate, of QM 1914 went pretty well and I was lucky to get a 'run' of build armies and navies for both the French and Italians. I think I made a mistake in not using the first of my two economic warfare cards against the might of Germany but managed to beat a few armies at the end when cards became sparse. I had used all my draw deck and had six cards at the end. Some nationalities - the American and British - were all played out as they suffered a wave of economic warfare attacks. Thank you Chris for an excellent rule summary. I think the game producers have succeeded in improving the mechanisms as they have simplified the supply rules and provided a card breakdown by nationality allowing better planning. I think we should all take new nationalities next time round as well.

A card driven game with interesting decisions. You always want to do more than you are able to. Not sure how balanced the game is. I played the entente and we pulled out a victory in the end fairly easily. i look forward to playing again to as the axis to see how it goes. We played with five.

Everybody in my gaming group is in love with this game. Great flavor, simple yet strategically deep and engrossing war game.

A worthy, yet quite different successor to the excellent original!

Backed on Kickstarter. Received on Nov. 2, 2016. Team warfare! This has become a club favorite for the 1st MN Historical Wargamers. Everytime I walk into the source this game is on the table. I should show up earlier so I can get into a game.

I like the variability in the ebb and flow from the new prepare action/powers. It allows for more decisions, some long term planning, and some bluffing. The attrition angle is also nice, and evocative. A great addition to the series.

My first impression was that of playing Category 5. With cows. And flies. Ok, so the wacky theme is quite funny... but is there anything new here? Not really.

In essence, Mow feels quite push-your-luck, but you have even less control than in Category 5 (where at least you get to somehow calculate which bad row you'll take). It's a funny game, but personally, when in the mood for a game such as this, I'd gladly take out my trusty Category 5 over this one.

I'll play if asked, most of the time. I'll just not suggest it over better choices.

UPDATE: This game finally clicked on me. I like it much more now, and will play it gladly most of the time.

2008. Boring game resembling Uno.  You play cow cards in a row (6 Nimmt or Hornochsen style) based on their value (and special cards can go between or on-top of other cards), and you're trying to force opponents to be unable to play their cow cards.  When this happens, they take the row of cards on the table (like 6 Nimmt) and the cards with flies are negative points.  The game ends when someone busts with 100 flies accumulated over multiple rounds, and the person with the fewest flies wins.  There is virtually no strategy because you have no idea what cards they have in their hand.  Kids may like the game, but adults will be bored.

Juego de cartas muy sencillo. Consiste en ir jugando cartas en función de su orden hasta que un jugador no puede añadir una carta. En tal caso se lleva todas las jugadas en la mesa. Se puntuan las moscas que aparecen en cada carta. Obviamente, el ganador de la ronda es quien recolecta menos moscas. Es entretenido, y con poca chicha. Especial para no jugones.

RATING: 7
A great game in the vein of 6 Nimmt/Category 5!  I will probably play this game when I have 3-4 players, and 6 Nimmt when I have more.

Like 6 Nimmt, this is a game about avoiding taking points.  On your turn, you have to add a cow to either end of the cow herd.  If you can't, you have to take the herd.  The more flies that are in the herd, the crappier for you!  You can also choose to take the cow herd and start a new one, even if you could have added a cow.  The choice boils down to whether you add a cow, hoping someone else will get stuck with the herd (if you think you have a strong hand), or to just take it before it gets any worse (if you think your hand sucks).

There are also some subtleties here that you'll see part way through your first game.  A simple game with a little more than meets the eye!

RATING: 6
This barely pretends to be a different game than 6 Nimmt. But this is an alright game in its own right. This feels like it has a little more control than 6 Nimmt, but it also feels like you're more likely to be screwed by a bad hand. It's also lost basically all of the tension and excitement of its spiritual predecessor. I'd like to play this more to compare, though. I dig the special cards and the cute art!

Very silly, next to impossible to win or to do anything meaningful in order to secure victory, yet strangely uplifiting due to the simplicity and speed at which it is played. Perfect 'one for the road' material, especially when alcohol has been consumed in copious amounts. (Perhaps that's how the designer got the idea in the first place.) Do not take this game seriously. If you do, you'll miss the point.

Fun little game which can be a bit strategic. The real downside are the symbols on the cards, they are very small, not clear at all and some really look alike. So as a beginner you will need very often to look at the (very) small player guide.

RATING: 5
Either add a card to one end of a row of cards or capture the row and the flies (Think of the bulls in Take 6.) that come with it. You have even less control over your fate than in Take 6. All you can do is to get rid of your mid-rank cards (on those few occasions when you have a choice) and hope that you don't draw similar replacements.

As much fun as being stuck in an elevator with the Bulgarian farting team. Mindless drivel. I'm a fan of the designer so I hope it sells well to people I don't game with. Like 6 Nimmt! or Hornochsen but with even less thought required.

I should clarify. I found I rarely got to make a decision, and bad things kept happening to me and there was nothing I could do about it. I felt like I was watching the game. Given that I didn't feel like I was participating, I couldn't wait for the game to end. Some people will like games that are this random, I don't. I prefer to be able to make choices that affect my fortunes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pointless.  There are so many better filler card games out there that this fails to compel me in anyway.  

It is highly determined on the cards you draw and when you get the opportunity to play them.  Things are a little too random, and the illusion of decision only lasts about a turn or two.  

Mow also overstays its welcome, by dragging players to 100 points the game can last way too long. If I am in the position where this hits the table again I would request it end after one round, not 100 points.

A silly little game that's a lot of fun. It's basically a simplified version of 6 Nimmnt!, where there is just one row to add to instead of five. The "deluxe" version comes with an electronic noise-maker with the sound of a cow. Totally unnecessary to play the game, but totally indispensable in making it fun.

RATING: 6
I am always on the lookout for fast, fun games that can be played with family and friends, but can also be enjoyed by gamers as a light filler.  While I already have numerous such games in my collection, it is always good to add more to keep things fresh.  As such, I'm happy to add MOW from designer Bruno Cathala to this collection.  

This is admittedly a simple game, somewhat along the lines of Take 6, Great Dalmuti and even UNO.  The strategies and tactics, while present, are fairly basic.  One tactic is to limit the choices of your opponents by playing a card that greatly increases the range of cards in the herd.  For example, if a "7" is already in the heard, playing a "2" eliminates all cards numbered 2 – 7 from being played.  The danger of this tactic is that if play returns to you, then your options will likely be severely limited.  Another tactic is to attempt to play the cards depicting lots of flies so that you can get them out of your hand.  Further, it is sometimes beneficial to grab a herd even if you could legally play, as this might free-up more options for you on the next hand.  While there is a bit of thinking and tactics involved, for the most part the game is simply light fun.  This makes it easily accessible for just about any age, and allows for light banter and conversation between the players without unduly hindering the flow of the game.  

MOW will not win any awards for deep strategy gaming or even educational value.  That's fine.  Not every game needs to be a mind bender, deeply challenging or dripping with theme.  Where MOW will shine, however, is at gatherings with family and friends when good conversation and chatter can be enjoyed while playing a light and entertaining game.  It sure beats watching endless reruns of holiday specials or listening to your aging relatives talk about their health ailments.  Those are two Christmas traditions I'm happy to terminate!

Well, it's of a genre I like.  Fast fillers.  It just seems to have a little less thinking than I like.

After a few plays we finally got the 2-player scores to within a few points of each other.  That's actually what I like to see.  It just seemed really rough to get it there.


The real decisions seem to be more about how stinky to make the table instead of when to take the table or not.  Don't get me wrong, taking the table at the right time is very important, but those decisions just don't seem super hard.  Judging ahead of time if you're going to get stuck with the table and deciding whether to add flies or not seems to be the more subtle and interesting touch.

Still, at the moment, I like Knizia's escalation better.  Just more tension.  And less "I win" cards.

Luck plays a big part in this game, and you can really feel at the mercy of the players to your side. However, this is a simple game that is quickly taught and not in the least difficult to play. I'd hesitate to call this "filler", since the ideal filler would offer greater depth in the same play time (about 10 minutes), but as a family game, or something to play with non-hobbyists, it is worth having a copy, given the low price.

Quick filler reminiscent of 6 Nimmt but there is only one line cards are played on and they are played in front of or in back of the card line (herd).  There are also a few special cards that let you insert within the herd, etc.  

As a bonus the box makes a mooing sound which is worth the price for admission alone.

Pretty good fun-to-time-commitment ratio. There is some strategy in this game, more than it seems at first, but it is still primarily a social, luck-based game. Makes a good alternative to Uno in that respect. I originally got this game because of all the comparisons to 6nimmt/Slide 5. 6 nimmt, profi variant, is a vastly superior game IMO. This game shares only superficial similarities.

Spassosissimo soprattutto grazie alle carte molto colorate e al tema 'mosche'. Un filler che si lascia giocare molto piacevolmente. Veloce e adatto a tutti i giocatori ad eccezione degli statisti e dei pensatori; è un gioco di carte semplice con pesca (quindi conta la fortuna). Lo spirito è quello di divertirsi e ridere insieme. Aumentando il numero dei giocari aumenta il divertimento.

MOW...MOO! A fun and take that game of cows and flies! It's very simple...play a cow, the next player must play a cow numbered higher or lower! The problem is there are these nasty flies on the cards...these are bad news...at the end of the game you count up your flies, the one with the most loses! So, if you cannot or do not want to play a card you take the cows...and the flies!

A very average filler type game, trying to avoid picking up the growing line of cards in the middle by playing a card lower than the lowest (0 is low) or by playing a card higher than the highest (16 is high). There's some avoidance cards to escape, but your fortunes are hitched to picking up these good avoidance cards or high and low. As a result, there's very little to think about, your only decision being if you want to pick up early if there's few points on the table and you have a poor hand, and hope to draw better cards for later.  It fits into that mindless, time-filling niche just fine, but, you know, it's mindless. In fact, the more I think about this, the lower the rating goes, especially when you're asked to play multiple rounds until someone gets 100 points.

Super Cute Hand Management Card Game by Bruno Cathala for 2-5 players ages 7 to 999!! You don't want to take the "tricks" because you want to end up with the least amount of flies.

Mow-Sound : Fun filler.  

I have rediscovered this gem of a game, it can be played over 1 round as s filler or play to X points, usually 3 or 4 rounds.

The Green and Yellow decks are almost identical apart from the special cards which are very different, the Yellow deck is ideally used when there are 6 - 10 players.

Based on one play: An extremely simply card game where you must play a card at the start or end of the line, which goes from zero to sixteen. If you cannot, you collect all the cards on the table and get negative points based on the number of flies on the cards. There are also special cards, such as the zero and the sixteen, an in between card and cards you can play over others, which have a lot of flies and also allow you to change the direction of play. but don't simply hold on to your cards, since at the end of each round, the cards you have in hand count against you. Cute and funny.

From the look of the cards, I was expecting Mow to be a nice filler along the lines of 6 Nimmt. But there's actually little more to it than something like Uno. The strategy seems obvious, and while the screw-you moments can be quite fun, it won't be troubling my regular filler rotation.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting variation of "Slide 5" (or "6 Nimmt!" if you prefer) with the changes being the addition of a few cards with special abilities as well as a slight change in focus - you are avoiding cards with flies on them rather than avoiding any cards whatsoever. Not much of a difference so if you have one of its other permutations (such as "Escalation", for example) there's really no reason for you to pick this up. Also, I found it slightly more luck-driven than its counterparts due to these changes, but it does have a very amusing theme that will surely attract players. 

Good, but rather unnecessary.

Nagyon könnyed filler játék. Sok mást játék eleme észrevehető benne, tehát semmiképpen nem nevezhető egyedinek. A grafika nagyon bohókás és ez jelentősen segít a játékélményen, sokat lehet nevetni a kártyákon. A saját sorsodat kevésbé tudod irányítani, ha rosszul jönnek ki a lapok, de nem is ezt várja el az ember ettől a játéktól. Van 10-15 perc üres idő, elő vele röhögjünk egy kicsit.

Ok, so you've got cows. The cows are on cards. The cards have flies. You hate flies. So you play the cards to get rid of the cows. Cows are orderly. Yes. Cows are. Cows like to be in order. Cows are tightly packed. That's true, too. Cows don't like other cows budding in between them. But the bulls bud in any way, because they're bulls. Some cows are climbing cows and like to stand on other cows, and although the other cows many not like it, there's nothing they can do about it because they're just regular cows. And then someone can't get rid of any more cows, and they can't play their cards, so they take all the cows from the row and pile them up in front of them. And then it starts over again. And then someone runs out of cows, and he laughs, and everyone dumps their hands onto their pile and counts all their flies. And the one with the fewest flies laughs harder. Then the cows are herded into the box and we go home.

A single row of numbered cows. On your turn, either add a card lower than the lowest, add a card higher than the highest or pickup the cards to score negative points based on how many flies are buzzing around the cows. Play multiple rounds until someone catches 100 flies, then lowest score wins. Blindingly simple (but in a good way), in the same league as games like 6 nimmt, poison or uno.

Nem sok gondolkodást igénylô családi kártyajáték. Sörözés mellé például kiváló.

A lapokon tehenek vannak, a tehenek körül változó számú legyek, van olyan ami mellett 0, van olyan ami mellett 5. A lapok 1-15-ig vannak számozva a lényeg hogy, amikor a játékos sorra kerül vagy letesz egy lapot az asztalra, vagy felveszi a már lerakott lapokat. Letenni csak olyan lapot lehet, ami a lent lévő sorba rakott lapok közül a legkisebbnél kisebb, vagy a legnagyobbnál nagyobb értékű. Amikor elfogytak a lapok a húzópakliból, akkor mindenki összeszámolja, hogy az elvitt lapjain összesen hány légy van. Aki először gyűjti össze a 100-at az vesztett.

With it's small square box,  single deck of cards and simple set of rules,  Mow is a game that can be easily dismissed.  If you like light card games,  that could be a mistake.

While it stirs some echoes of 6 nimmit through it's graphic design,  this game shares none of the mechanics of the aforementioned - most notably the blind bidding with which that was built around.

Instead,  Mow offers a single claustrophobic row to be played on.  For the most part,  you can control the speed of the row's demise - slowly,  by playing just under or over - or rapidly,  by playing to the extremes.

I was guilty of initially thinking there wasn't much here.  But with 4 players this simple design shines like a brand new penny.

[i]Mow[/i] plays like a two-dimensional [i]Escalation![/i] as instead of simply piling up numbers and trying to be king of the hill, players lay out numbered cards in a line and on each turn, you are trying to play a card that’s higher or lower than the cards already in play. Both games are light and move quickly, and luck does play a factor as you'll sometimes draw (or not draw) precisely the card that you need on the next turn.

only 1 row of cards, play to the left or right (like the profi version of 6 nimmt), some special cards.

And: At the end of a round, cards still in hands count negative.

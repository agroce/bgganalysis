Didn't really get into it. Had the promise of being a more manageable alternative to the never-to-be-completed Europa series. The footprint of the combined game is just a tad too big for convenience.

Air system is a bit fiddly. Too much rules overhead for too little gain in some spots, but not a bad take on the eastern front.

This is the East Front component of SfE and for many, many years this was all there was.  It is very playable by itself but it suffers from the same problem between experienced players.  Play becomes abstracted and it loses its operational feel.  Still a great game though.

Hardly a bad game, but just not for me. I found the air rules overly complex for what you end up with. And the combat ratio determination tiring due to the relatively large factors involved. However, my friends really enjoyed it, so what do I know?

Not overly impressed. Its main virtue is the speed of play for a game of this scope and size; the basic game mechanics are simple and easily learned. But it's let down by the air system in particular, which is overwrought when compared to ground combat, and requires substantial time and rolls to resolve.

Other than the slightly smaller footprint, I can't see where this game improves on Red Star Rising.

RATING: 5
Old fashioned locking ZOC system.  Pretty lame by today's mobile warfare simulation standards, it's all about factor counting (with big numbers) to get that 7:1 against a stack.  Still, relatively simple, has discrete air and naval units, and very pretty components.  I would try it again, face to face.  Original try was by PBEM, tedious.

Update: tried it again solo using extensive house rules to make it play like Proud Monster.  Germans still can't get anywhere near their historical advance, though of course it is better than the rules as written.  The unit/space scale is such that you need strong ZOCs for the Germans (but not the Soviets) to even form a line, which is lame, so this got sold again, for good this time.

Fire in the East/Scorched Earth, at corps level, that fits on a reasonably-sized table.  My experience so far is that the assessment of the forces in relation to each other is quite accurate, the ground game is fascinating, the air game is a bit clunky but ultimately functional, and the naval game is 99% overkill (but necessary from the ETO perspective for the Western Front sequel).

Good: East Front - Operational - Medium

Got this as I was looking for East Front two mappers. I think this an overlooked game (nobody knew there was a 2nd edition but this is typical for CoA...not the best in Marketing...).I also think this is an underrated game; 

Plus:
-A simple core system
-Accessible, clear rules (23 pages)
-A great innovation: you can attack individual units in a stack! Now this is changing all East front games you have ever played!
-Great old school feel and looks; I love the map and counters, looks very pretty.
-Breakdown units and upgrades!
-Fun air rules.

Minus:
-The air rules are nice but a lot of administration. I love the rules as it gives the game another interesting layer.
-Another point is the odds calculation; have a calculator at the side! I havo no issues with it at all, I actually like this as it is an integral part of the system. For those who don't like it to optimise odds: attacker not allowed to investigate stacks.
-Bloody CRT: ever lost three Corps in an attack gone wrong? In this game you better see if an attack is worth it as conscequences can be dire.

Heavy on colum shift calculations but seems a very interisting game with unit breakdowns.

Not a typical CoA game, it is quite old school as far as components, rulesset as well as system is concerned.

Three things will decide either victory or defeat:
-Type of attack: individual units in a stack or whole stack?
-Make use of multiple overrun's or lose...time or the game...
-Upgrades

Many games try to prevent too much focus odds calculation by not being able to investigating enemy stacks. In War Without Mercy however, odds calculation is the name of the game...
The lower odds are very tricky and can be bloody. So much so that it should either be avoided or at least the importance of a lower odds should carefully be weighed.
Moreover, the odds calculation is extremely important to decide:
-Attack whole stack or individual unit in the stack;
-Odds to make overrun attack.

All in all an excellent game and I am curious how this compares to from Ted Raicer.

The whole Eastern Front of WWII on a manageable scale.  Ground units are corps and air counters represent 150 planes.  While it feels old-school in that there is a lot of factor counting, the relatively easy rules encourage soak-off attacks and forcing your opponent to give ground or be out-of-supply.  The air and naval rules take some time to learn, but they play out fairly quickly and add some nice chrome to the system.

Just starting play and it is a fairly simple system. The concern is with how dated it all is and how game mechanics like the "rich man/poor man" attacks encourage slow play.

Straight out of the '60's. Enemy ZOCs are not cancelled by friendly units. So with 30 mile hexes and you have two or three corps in a hex and another of yours has to retreat through, it is still eliminated by the enemy having some small unit next to the three corps. Yes, three guards or panzer corps will let an nearby small enemy unit eliminate another corps (or three) over a 30 mile wide corridor that they should easily control.... This turns the game into chess where you have to have every ZOC perfectly covered. A breakthrough has to be at least 90 miles wide to be safe from ZOC elimination. 90 miles! 
This and the constant factor counting that the system encourages AND the ancient CRT with AE results really makes this game an anachronism. Was this design sitting in a file cabinet for 40 years before they published it? I could expect stuff like this in a 40 year-old game but not something published in the last decade.

I am naturally attracted by any strategic eastern front WW2 game because of the "Russian Campaign" game experience during my teenager. "Bliztkerig" tactic came as a shock to me.  The game is one of the Struggle for Europe series, strategic scale in scope but with a good doze of operational decisions.  More rich, say, than the Third Reich or Advanced Third Reich. This strategic game appeals to me because of its scope, game package and complexity level.   The scope is strategic with an operational doze.  Armies/ Corps of both sides are nameless (i.e. they are generic).  Leaders are present and with quite, well relatively as to other games, significant role in combat.  It is a game of both strategic and operational- lite game.  In that you make both decisions on a simpler scale and lesser considerations.  The emphasis is on manouver- to- combat.  Both sides can make 2 movement (1 normal and 1 exploitation) and thus take 2 combat operations each 2-weeks turn. Game package is top notch, albeit the cover is cartoonish.  The counters and maps are very attractive.  Many gamers compare this series to Europa seires in that they have many similarities.  But the overall package of Struggle in Europe is more attractive and doesn't have the "blend" feeling of the more "serious" Europa. Complexity level is an accomodate between Third Reich/ Europa and many operational level games (e.g. GMT's East Front series).  It can certainly be played in a day for the scenarios after you become more fmailiar with the system.  And the campaign game is a monster that requires energy and time investment.  I am very happy with the game and will delve into it more later on.

So far the best corps/army-level Russian front game I've encountered.  Much like the Russian Campaign -> Russian Besieged series, but with more detailed air power.  The biggest difference is that War Without Mercy is limited to the opening stages of the war.  The one time I played the Russian's were tough to break through.  I'm not sure if I got off to a bad start as the Germans or if the play balance is a bit off.  In either case, it didn't distract from my enjoyment of the game.  The thought needed to put together a combined armor/air strategy that could break a Russian line was what made the game for me.

The fierce fighting on this front (or fronts actually) is simulated very nicely in this strategic game. 

edit (changed rating from 8.5 to 7.5): I really like the 'smoothness' and the stress on manouvre in the ground combat rules. The air and naval rules are too much fuss for my taste though. Rating is for whole Struggle for Europe series. Only War Without Mercy is still 8.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Solid corp level simulation of the russian campaign. One of its highlight is the "innovative" way to treat combat. You can select to attack specific units in a stack to recreate spoiling attacks designed to attrite enemy units instead of taking ground or go for the tradtional all against the hex attack.

I have recently upped the score beacuse I am loving it. The air system is nice and gave you an idea of the process and not only of the effect.

My new favorite medium complexity game on the Eastern Front. Not quite as good as Fire in the East, but better (only by a little) than Russian Campaign. The system can be compared to Europa light, with the same basic sequence of play as Fire in the East. Plus it fits on my dining room table. I agree with others that the air system is a bit too complex and too detailed for a corps level game. An air point system would make the game move along much more quickly.

Good treatment of the war in Russia.  Big enough to produce many decisions, bur the rules are fairly simple.  When combines with the other titles for all of the Struggle for Europe, the subsystems all flow well together.

RATING: 10
The system is very simple (it's essentially Europa scaled up to corps level, or Third Reich with more detail), which allows the players to concentrate on planning, strategy and allocation of resources like in few other wargames. Considering the difficulty of simulating the whole of WW2 with one model, this system is pretty robust. The air system is not complex, just a bit detailed - if you're not up to it, you can always change it to "aircraft on demand" like in the most recent Europa rules. "Clever panzer pushing", very suitable for competitive play.

RATING: 8.5
After playing Polish campaign and Barbarossa scenario to Dec 41) as a warm-up, my friends and I decided for the campaign game to simply ditch the naval rules & counters: an absolute waste of time/space when playing WwM by itself.
   That being said, the ground rules work beautifully, allowing weak Russian units to give the Axis a very realistic view of "death by a thousand cuts" via the excellent attack rules.
The air rules are a bit tedious but can make the difference between a walkover and a brutal struggle for each combat. Partisan rule is clean and effective. Best armour rules ever seen at this scale. 
Gorgeous maps and counters. The map hexes are small and it's best to clip counters for this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Beautiful counters and game maps.  You can tell Clash of Arms had fun producing this game.  This system gets down to business not being too tactical or technical, say like GDW's Europa series (and I love Europa for these reasons).  Supply rules are nice and easy.  Players can play OKW or STAVKA in their decision-making.  Leaders add the extra punch you need for crucial battles.  The Struggle for Europe series starts with War Without Mercy, Brute Force (Western Front) and the soon to be added title, Soft Underbelly, covering the Mediterranean and North African theatres.  Soft Underbelly promises to link it all together for a massive European War game of World War Two.

RATING: 7.5
As a stand alone Barbarossa 1941 game this is a "6".  But as a total war game, '41-'45, or as a companion to the entire series, I'd say it is more like an 8 or 9.  Nice streamlined system for grand ETO play.

RATING: 9
Straight forward and easy to learn ground forces rules.  Air and naval rules are quite a bit more convoluted, but I like the results.  The map is of the highest quality and the counters are also very good.  The counter density is quite high making trimming the counters a must.  I've played a few games of WWM already and am currently playing Brute Force and then will take on Med: Desert War.  Before the year is out I plan on playing the entire Campaign Scenario, although constuction of a larger table may be necessary.

This is a new game without the shrink wrap. I was going to get the entire set but went a different direction. After I decided that I stuffed it with bubble wrap and filler and put it in a box for storage. No shelf wear that way. I've decided to sell it, I will ask $50.00 for it. I will put an ad in market place with some pictures.

Playable monster. The rules for air and naval combat might seem a bit fiddly at first, but are a real treat once you've learned them. The generic counters take away some of the historical flavour, but makes for easy setup.Very well written rulebook that's easy to navigate.The combat system is a tad bloody to be realistic in my opinion, but the high number of replacements keeps things in balance. A very nice game that plays very smoothly.

I feel I'm being generous with a 5.

The games falls between two stools. It has a fairly simple land game that is a bit attritional but many East Front games can be. Then it has grafted onto it an air game that's out of place and is too detailed and complex.

I really wanted to like this game but the crazy, over complicated air rules and ar units just don't work. Also, whilst not being a rules lawyer I found I could drive a horse and cart through some of the supply rules. 

The componants are top notch and I think thats way I feel I must be generous

For sure one of the most interesting wargame. Mind that this is a HARD CORE COSIM, not suited for beginners, but grognard will love it.

It takes time to get into the system, but it worths it.

Units (usually corps) can be broken up (into divisions and regiments), but also upgraded.

Players can build fortification and airport. 

Units can overrun weak enemy formations and movement is ZOC affected, thus a deep planning is needed.

Unfortunately the marketing was not very good, but the game... love it...

The best rule set is the 3rd editions.

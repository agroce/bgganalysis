RATING: 6
A little sloppy & seems to lack focus. Some of the coolest components around. With some tweaks it has a lot of potential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are lots to like about this (e.g. the card play, different abilities and building attributes, quality of the components) but unfortunately once again, Eagle just fall short of delivering that slick game they keep threatening. A flawed endgame/victory criteria and an overly long and fiddly battle sequence spoil this one. Good fun but could have been so much better with a just a bit more development.

Somewhat disappointed in this one.  The resource management/building aspect is fine, pretty straightforward, but I really hated the rock/paper/scissors combat system.  Also, I felt like the cube supplies weren't big enough, so sometimes you would get the shaft just because the player to your left used the gather action, and the cubes are gone by the time your turn rolls around.  I would play again, but overall it was "meh"

Not bad, but I think the military part is to dominant and the fighting mechanics are quite luck dependent. Also the scoring mechnism can result in some players having no victory points at all while another player has most of them.

RATING: 5
Nice components & artwork (bar the scorpion man). Limited replayability & player interaction. Combat mechanics are nothing more than a dicefest with combat being decided largely through luck, even managing to screw the rock/paper/scissor mechanic. Long downtimes during combat.

In 2003 I was in full Puerto Rico rage, I had in mind my own game design with different actions that the players could choose in a Puerto Rico style, but card driven. Then Age of Mythology came along and I thought that it looked really good (there was a lot of hype about it in the BGG). I got it and I thought that the idea of players asigning victory points to different objectives was very clever, but I hated the battle system. I played a few times and I lost my interest in the game and hated even more the battle system. For a while I thought that the battle system could be fixed changing some rules, but finally I traded the game away.

A combination , it seems, of different styles of gaming. Lots of plastic monsters, lots of wooden cubes, tile placement and card play. It's fun but only in small doses.

RATING: 5
Not to my tastes. The combat system involves lots of dice-rolling. That&#039;s not to my taste when I&#039;m involved, or when I&#039;m not involved in the game for a few minutes while a couple of other players battle. On top of that, combat decisions are rendered fiddly by the interactions between unit types. And it&#039;s long.

RATING: 9
I unabashedly love this game: it has a great blend of economics, combat, and building up.  The quality of the board, miniatures, and cards are excellent.
 
My only big complaint is that combat takes forever, unless one accepts 5s as successes as well as 6s.

The game itself is interesting, a nice mix of Risk with Puerto Rico.  The bits are nice, but mostly unneeded (The plastic figs are just counters/markers, and the cards could do the same thing...)

Imagine Puerto Rico simplified to the point of banality.  Now add a combat system that is painfully drawn out.  Top with a good dollop of random cards and dice rolls. Now play for far too long.  At least the victory point system is novel and deserves to be re-used in a better game.

Couldn't pass this one up for the price.  I do enjoy devolopment the similarities between this and Puerto Rico, but I found the military aspect of this unbalanced leading players to forgo this aspect to progress. Update: I've changed this one from 7 to 6, this game seems to drag on a bit long for what it is....

A game that really leans on the license to sell. Sure, it has nice minis. Sure, it is really unusual. But its hard to figure out what works and what doesn't in this game, which makes it challenging to bring back to the table as people don't really form a fondness for it.

Yet another of Eagle Games poorly playtested games. The economics are broken and the balance is warped as a result. I wonder if they&#039;ll ever get it right.

In the game store where I regularly play, Age of Mythology was released onto the shelves at exactly the same time as A Game of Thrones.
After a couple of rounds of playing each in a public forum, the sales record was 8:0 in favour of A Game of Thrones.

Just goes to show what a rushed product release  does to sales.

This plays like Puerto Rico lite, with objectives like the video game.  It's a well designed game, unlike some of the other Eagle games.  Some bits are very nice and some bits are bland, and that's a bit offputting, but doesn't actually affect game play.

This plays well with two, which Puerto Rico doesn't.

Was a fun game, the rules were a tad fiddly. Lots of cool miniatures. I bought it because I was a fan of the PC game. I sold it because of the maximum of 4 players, which was too few for our group at that time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I was not a fan.

I've played this game once, in a 2 on 2 team game (I was on the Norse team, playing against the Egyptian team).

Things were going along fine, until one of the Egyptian players started to attack.  He was barely victorious in his first attack.  Then the other Norse player built a frost giant, and one of those things that destroys two buildings.  Then he attacked back.  Then two turns later, the Egyptian player tried to attack me.  And I killed everything he had without taking a single casualty.

The result?  He was never able to recover, and the game ceased to be a challenge for the Norse.

My problem is twofold- one, luck plays too major a factor in battle.  I rolled three dice and got two hits.  My opponent rolls 7 dice and gets one.  That's rough.

Second, it just seems REALLY impossible for a player who is down to ever get back into the game.  We could once a turn attack him, and he was fairly certain never to recover.  

I also suspect that the individual groups aren't completely balanced, but I don't have enough experience to be 100% sure of that.

Kind of an empire building game where you can't eliminate the other opponents.  This fact can in some cases keep a player from winning and really make them not want to play but in my experience this does not happen often enough with 4 or more players because everyone is more worried about the person winning than in someone who has little to offer.

Risk management game with strong degree of resource building balanced by conflict resolution. Assymetric player boards reflect natural advantages enjoyed by each of 3 cultures. 

Great 3 player game, plays well with 2.

Some nice Euro game ideas waiting to get out.  The game stops for the battles which are disproportionately time consuming and lead to the frequent problem that the players fighting are both left too weak.  Not keen on the restriction that you can only attack your neighbours.

Based on one playing. While I'm not into fantasy theme wargames (except for WotR) nor do I appreciate the varied number of mythological units available I did find this game offered a satisfying mix of combat and civilization development that allows for multiple path to victory. Combat is via the bucket of dice approach per unit, I would prefer rolling one die instead for each unit and resolving combat with one shot, as is customary, speeding up play. But AoM system, while slow, works fine too. Need more plays for a better opinion.

Overall a fun game, particularly if you have teenagers and want to push them beyond Risk and its variants. Combat is not that bad.  In the games I have played, somone usually withdraws after a few rounds anyway, and combat seems to have about the right low-to-moderate emphasis.  There is a definite luck factor, but you can be unlucky and still win if you plan well.  On the plus side, however, one lousy player does not become the kingmaker, as in PR or some other Eurogames.

The combat system is stupid.  The plastic bits do nothing but get in the way of combat.  The only reason I can see why they were included in the game (instead of chits or cards) is because making plastic bits is the one (maybe the only) thing Eagle Games did extremely well.

Great game, lots of fun, and multiple paths to victory. There are some downsides, the biggest being that a single game tends to run for a long time. Also, there are enough boards and pieces for 6 players but not enough resource cubes. Finally, given the detail provided for the figures and the terrain pieces, I was very disappointed that the city pieces are just squares with plain text on them. There were also some odd rules (like not being able to trade with other players) but none of these are bad enough to ruin the game.

Combat is the one ugly part of this system but it is also easy to patch up with a few simple house rules. I highly suggest using the 5-6 = success rule along with a means to introduce strategy instead of the blind combatant selection that currently occurs.

Surprisingly tight, three-player contest. Players must balance between exploring for and gathering resources against building civic structures and advancing culture against building armies and waging war. The more competitve the participants, the better the game is. Production values are high, as is standard of Eagle products, but also a bit garish, cluttered, and overdone-- which is also standard. I had a hard time separating my Battle Cards from my Permanent and Random Actions decks, for example. Counters which matched the rich illustration style of the cards may have been been a bettermatch for this particular, but that isn't the Eagle Way. Would be interested in trying the 5-6 player expansion some day. Might be a good candidate for reprinting by another publisher some day...

One of the games that got me back into boardgaming a number of years ago.  Pretty good fun.  We tend to avoid adversarial games that encourage king making with odd numbers of players, and this is a game that can fall into that category. The combat system could use some tuning, but there are some excellent alternate rules available here on the Geek.  If the game rules used the alternate rules, I'd rate this higher.

I'd rather play Puerto Rico anytime. The problem is players tend to want the study the chart with the units' abilities before each round of battle and this really adds to the length!

RATING: 4
A pretty straightforward RTS translation, and very enjoyable -- but there are a few issues (for my preferences anyway) that drop the rating quite a bit.  The number of available unit types was way too overwhelming for me.  If there were fewer options it would be much more manageable; or even if they required an upgrade action, like the units in Warcraft: the Board Game, based on your current Age of Mythology. I'd have preferred some additional intrinsic advantages to your choosing the Gather and Explore actions, since everyone else can benefit from those as well. The victory points seem quite hefty, and in fairly restrictive areas -- if there are 20 VPs to be had from Largest Army but you've been prioritising Most Buildings, which has only 10 VPs, then you're going to lose the game even if you play better than everyone else.

RATING: 6
A very lengthy game (4hrs!) that does not give good enough of a return on the time invested. The battles are clumsy and requires players to spend 15 minutes looking up all the different powers of both sides. In our game, Medusa from the Greek army was arguably the most powerful as she won all tie breakers. In the end, the 3 nations seem to have strengths and weaknesses that seem to balance each other out. I won as the Norse!

The game is a good marriage of a euro (based on a Puerto Rico platform) with Ameritrash killing, pillaging and dice rolling. This same author produced Age of Empires III which has a simlar feel but based on the Caylus/Pillars of the Earth flatform.

Eagle has nicely produced this game, with individual army pieces for all three nations. I personally don't care for the art on the decks of cards.

I don't think this game will get played again, simply based on the length of play.

There are so many possitive things to say about this game.  If one has ever played Puerto Rico before, this game is fairly reminicent of that game, with combat thrown in for good measure.  The resource dynamic is very interesting, and the method for actions is very much like Citadels.  The only thing which mars this otherwise fabulous game is the battle system, where one doesn't know exactly who they are attacking, and is silly chance, like many of eagle games silly little battle systems.  However, I definately love this game and the units, progression, and battle setup are very entertaining, and I would recomend this game to those strategy fans who don't want a lot of complexity, but still wants a bit more strategy then Settlers of Catan.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Close to being a great game, but a couple of things makes it the opposite.
The fighting system is annoying and takes way to long which makes the game drag.
The action card draw can set you back a long time which makes the game even longer.
3 hours are way to much.

RATING: 7.8
Excellent game and components. Blends Euro elements well with combat. We changed the combat system to hit on 5's and 6's and that made the game more satisfying. Some minor quibbles re. the victory points system and the weaker players that fall behind get picked on with very little hope. I don't have a problem with that however as I don't like games that artificially reward weaker players when they fall behind to auto-calibrate the game. Don't fall behind!

I like the strong theme and chaos of the combat system, though the "outguess your opponent" aspect doesn't appeal to me.  There is a negotiation/political aspect to the game, but it isn't as overpowering as it is in Mare Nostrum.  Some good trade-off decisions throughout the game.

The game can be a bit long, and the combat mechanic (roll so many d6 and count up the number of 6s rolled) could be improved to decrease the down time between turns for players not involved in the combat. But despite that, the variety of cards available in the random decks and being able to control at least some aspect of your hand using the permanent deck increases the strategic possibilities. If you like long games with lots of dice rolling for combat, Age of Mythology is probably right up your alley. Personally, I don't feel the need to buy it, but I'll play if asked and I have time.

AoM is good and fun, but it seems like it could have been better with more sophisticated combat rules, or more interesting god powers.

Blech. Attack your opponent's resources first thing and he - get this - won't have the resources to build up his army to defend against you next turn either. Who playtested this thing? We constantly had players who were "out of contention" early: sometimes before they had even taken their first turn.
Pretty components mixed with bad mechanics and poor balance do NOT a good game make.
Sold it for cheap at a convention flea market.

My criterion for rating games

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: good game that has a different feel each time particularly if you change civilizations. The troops are different as well as different actions that you can take depending on the cards you draw. Exploring the resource tiles always is fun and changes each game.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  Tons of fun/meaningful decisions throughout the game.

3) Player interaction:  A lot of interaction through the action phase and combat.

4) Game length/complexity: This game takes too long for what it is. It is not super complex, but it can go on for quite a long time if players do not rush toward advancing to the next age and there is lots of combat. Combat is destructive.

5) Components:  This game has awesome components and artwork



Bottom line: An ok game that takes way too long. Combat is too destructive and there seems only one way to win and that is building troops and attacking. Also combat is very dependent on luck.

My view of the game resembles that of most other people. It has the capacity to be a great game, and almost suceeds, but the very basic and boring combat system drags it down.

I like the Puerto Rico and La Citta aspects of the game,  along with the minis and civilization differences, but the combat system drags the game down into oblivion. The rock-paper-scissors nature is interesting in the early going, but once everyone establishes the 'iron triangle' of Giant Myth Unit - Giant Myth Unit Killer - Giant Myth Unit Killer Killer then everything becomes very random and there's no way our group could see to fix it. Additionally, the game seems to play overly long for what it is, and the incentive to kick the player who is down can also be seen as a major problem. A lot of potential for this one, but overall a failure. If you're looking for a German - American hybrid I suggest Wallenstein over this by a large margin.

A couple of years on, and I still think this is a pretty important release but after playing some of the games that have followed in its wake that have more successfully blended European and American design traits I'm afraid that its flaws have become all the more egregious, even thous this is still a very interesting and worthwhile game.  I think, as Walt Mulder states in his comment, that this game really bridges the gulf between American and German style games.  It seems to me like some American publishers think that a "German-Style" game means little more than wooden bits and a scoring track.  AOM avoids that trap.  The key to me is that it is clear that Mr. Drover has studied and understands the mechanics that make games like Puerto Rico and Settlers so good and here he has deftly incorporated some of those things into what is essentially a mapless wargame.  The result is quite unique and doesn't really play like PR, Settlers, or any of the other Eagle games.  My test play was very refreshing (particularly after play after play of the sort of "filler" and "lightweight" games that seem to have dominated the Euro market), I really got a sense that even though this game borrows a lot of elements from other systems it ends up as something new.  New ideas like the "wagering" on victory conditions are interesting and the differences between each of the cultures bear close strategic scrutiny.  I also think the game captures the feel and scope of the computer game on which it's based _very_ well, which I never would have thought a board game could successfully capture the RTS millieu.  The components are excellent, I do wish the building tiles were a little nicer but hey, PR's tiles only had text too. Revolutionary?  Time will tell.  I don't think this is "The One" that will kick of the Great American Boardgaming Revolution but for now I think it's excellent and one of the better American games available.  It does play a little long but somehow I didn't mind.  C'mon people, the game has 300 plastic miniatures AND wooden cubes...talk about covering the bases!

This game has a lot of very good elements. The combat seemed to have a lot of luck but thats not necessarily a bad thing. The time was a little long on our first playing but its not overly long. The combat was very interesting and the production and city building elements were good. I thought there was potential for more bad luck in random card draws than in the combat. I won in combat when I was involved but rarely drew a combat card so consequently I lost.

A good game once you realize that it isn't a war game despite all the plastic miniatures. (In fact, there are far too many different types of units - armies are unnecessarily complex and tedious to set up). The economic side of the game reminds me of Puerto Rico but it is IMHO more engaging due to more player interaction. Some of the card abilities need tweaking. I would rate the game 8 with some house rules.

This is an awesome game for what it is. If you don't mind the luck of dice rolling there is still quite a bit of strategy in it.  It is optimal with 3 people.

Special card abilities were a great drive, and I am really drawn by the theme and the great miniatures!!!

Age of Mythology is a fun play.  I like the player boards where you build out your unique lands, resources, and armies.  The miniatures are very cool.  They are detailed, and you can tell them apart without having to get close.
I liked the difference between the different player armies/themes/land areas.  We played a 3 player game & it was a cool thing to have to prepare your forces for enemies with two totally different army types.
Good mix of strategy and competition for resources.
Oh, and I liked the dice combat.
Solid title.  You should try it.

An improvement on previous Eagle games - the rules are quite good and the game doesn&#039;t last forever (though it can run on too long).  Unfortunately, it still has lots of luck with the random action cards and dice rolling.  The combat mechanic is too silly - a guessing game with dice rolling.  There are some component problems as well - in the end, just an okay game.

AofM is a mixture of PR & Risk. But lacks the simplicity and balance. There are many other games available that will provide a much more rich and fulfilling gaming experience.

This was the first Eagle game I played, so I cannot hold it up to past Eagle games, but it played fairly well and I'd like to play it a few more times before I give it a final rating.  Played a 3 player game, and all went smoothly.  I avoided reading the rules beforehand and so came in fresh.  It almost feels too short, if that makes sense.  It seemed that just when things were getting rolling and we were ready for a big smackdown, it was the last turn (turn 10)and I had to carefully avoid doing anything in order to win.  Almost anti-climactic.  I bet it plays totaly different the next time.  Also, building the monument must be nigh impossible.  I'm not sure I believe it can be done (in a 3 player game, at least).  UPDATE: It's been more than a year since my first playing, and it hasn't hit the table since.  UPDATE: No real interest in playing this again.

I owe this game some more playthroughs. I got this long before I got into serious boardgames, and at the time it was too complicated for me. Now that I have a ton of real games under my belt I think I owe this game revaluation.

Has some good ideas, but suffers too many flaws for me to give it a better rating.  Only including 3 races when they could have included 6 is poor and lazy packaging. The Egyptians clearly have the best early game units and overall map board while Greeks will suffer due to poor units and bad map/tile averages.

Neat abstract game of building a kingdon (like peurto rico) but with armies that fight.  Much more interaction between players than puerto rico.
Combat is a bit long selecting a more complex rock-paper-scissors combo with a fun amount of variability in it (only hit on 6s).

Looking forward to trying it again!

Player aid charts really help with the combat.  Some really good ideas in this one (Especially betting VP on long term goals) and I love the minis and the idea of Mythical armies fighting it out.  Not bad, a solid effort, but doesn't quite have enough in it to get Euro fans interested.   Dice chuckers and civ fans will dig it.

Players take an "empire" and play Puerto Rico like actions to gather resources, explore new lands, build armies and buildings, attack others and advance their cultures.  Lots of choices in strategy (passive, expansive, bellicose), fast playing until somebody decides to attack then the game stops for 10 minutes while combat is resolved.  If combat were quicker, I'd rate this higher.  As it stands, still quite good.

Clearly inspired by Puerto Rico and Settlers of Catan with the best of American gaming, e.g. the attack factor and player interaction. The componants are just amazing. For the price, this game is a steal. My rating has gone up from 9 to 10 as I have now played morethan 10 games with 3-4 players and 2 2-player games. Everybody I played with was taken with the game. There is a lot of things to do and a lot of player interaction. The only drawbacks we found were the rather bland building tokens and that sometimes, the game actually seemed to end when things were getting really tense. By the way, I am very aware of the contreversy surronding Eagles' games. As a disclaimer, I own all of them and have been less then enthusiastic about all of them exept for Napoleon in Europe which to me is an exeptional game even with its many flaws (we have worked around those and are having a blast with the game). I have especially been disappointed with Civ. I thought that Attack! was a step in the right direction but this one is clearly a winner. I just thought I would let people know where I am coming from.

RATING: 6
Really great looking game, but combat slows things down.  This might improve with familiarity with all of the options.  I think you have to choose your path to victory early on and stick with it.

 The big problem is the winner is the one who does NOT engage in combat.  Let your opponents weaken themselves and then mop up.

An interesting attempt to create a kind of hybrid between "Puerto Rico" and a fantasy wargame. In fact it is the mechanics stolen from the latter that really shine in this game, as the actual battle rules need revision (proven by the myriads of house rules for this game). The miniatures are cool as always with Eagle Games, but sometimes one gets the impression that the game wants to be more clever than it actually is. Player interaction is limited - the players sitting diagonally in a 4 player game will never have to do something with each other except competing for victory.

Played once.  I can't imagine playing this game with more than 3 players; more battles would occur that you're not involved in.  There's a strange balance between racing to build the largest army and gain the victory points for that, and not attacking other players, taking casulties, and losing the largest army.  There's better games out there, but there's still some fun to be had here occasionally.

Divertido pero largo y además con una curiosa forma de librar las batallas(cada uno tiene un número de unidades en su reserva pero sólo unas cuantas podrán ir a cada batalla y además se elige de modo "secreto" cada uno de los enfrentamientos dentro de cada batalla.

Mechanics stolen from other games, a nonsensical theme (Norse gods battling it out with Egyptian ones?), and an expensive batch of useless plastic figurines (cards would work better).  Worst of all, it's no fun to play.  The combat system is S L O W and eventually degenerates to the point where it's better to concede than to fight, lose a creature, and have to rebuild it.  I cannot believe this was ever playtested with two players (our one and only game lasted four boring hours).  The only interesting rule is how Victory Points get alloted from turn to turn.  But really, a wretched game.  Like the movie "Thin Red Line," I would never have started it if I'd known how long it would take, and the only enjoyable part was when it was over.

One of my first big boardgame purchases.  Unfortunately this is one of the games that just hasn't held up for me as I've dived deeper into the hobby.  Haven't even gotten it off the shelf in a couple years.  As a worker placement, resource management game - better games are out there for that (Agricola, Stone Age, etc).  I'm not a fan of war games - and the clunky 'rock-paper-scissors' battles really bog the gameplay down.  Building up your army through recruitment is cool, especially with the plastic minis that game has and I like the idea of bidding for the winning bonus condition.

After playing once, I have to say this is a pretty awesome approximation of a RTS, with one exception. It takes 3 hours to play a game vs. 30 minutes on the computer. The combat system gets a lot of crap from people, but it didn't really bug me. What did bug me was that they didn't include a cool "battle board" to set your armies on when combat begins. The table is already packed with resource cubes, plantation chips, victory cards and unrecruited armies. And I'm supposed to find a place to set my army without getting confused or lost. Also, right out of the box, this is a three player game, period. I'm sure you can play with 2 people or 4, but it's really a 3 player game. Okay, bitching aside, let's get it straight that this is an awesome system set-up for a game. Cool mechanics (borrowed from Puerto Rico? Sure, but if you're going to borrow, why not borrow from a system that works?) and hard choices. I'm excited to pull it out again sometime, but only if there are three of us with 4 hours to kill.

AoM is a very creative game with a lot going for it but for me has some problems that hold back my rating.

Firstly, the battles, though ingenious in a tense rock-paper-scissors way, really slow down the game down and can be frustrating for those not involved.  Secondly, and this is probably mostly a problem with 4 or more players, it can be very hard to contain the leader.  His immediate opponent on the right is often paralyzed not wanted to take a harvest action and give his opponent additional resources, but then unable to build or recruit.  When the leaders neighbors do try to battle, they then give advantage to those across the table.

I enjoy much of this game, but it can be quite frustrating and too long.

Only played once, and would like to try again sometime... the time I did play, one player wasn't too happy about a particular strategy and it seemed the game was in danger of collapse, so the rest of the table avoided an entire facet of the game to appease the one player.

RATING: 5
Interesting game but some of its mechanics are quite dated. Three player game will all players walking away saying they are not adverse to play again and recommending possible options to update some of the more dated mechanics.

The victory point distribution system is really nice but there need to be more than 4 cards upon which to distribute the points. Building the wonder to rush the end of the game is also quite anti-climatic.

The random actions draw is nice as you can always rely upon the fixed actions should you not happen to draw exactly what you need.

The resource mechanic and city building mechanics are nice but the quarry building (-1 build cost) is very very powerful especially when you play the card that lets you build 3-4 buildings in a turn.

I don't think I will ever play this with more than 3 players as if you have more than three the faction that is then over represented means the players will draw from a shared deck.

My crew and I loved this game after the first play.  The rules were easy to master and unlike many other games we've played, there was never a moment where we had to interpret a fuzzy rule based on a majority consensus.

Combat does not play a major role in this game, but it can be decisive.  The resource gathering aspect and Victory Point allocations are the real bread and butter for fun.

In my opinion, AoM is an enjoyable game and should have a higher average rating than it does.

--Wow!  Color me impressed.  First (partial) play-through went very well, testing out the subsystems.  Much less complex than it appears at first, but certainly not "simple".  Production quality is incredible, the subsystems work very well, and I had no problem with the combat (we had three battles, using 5s and 6s, of course, as this is how even Glenn suggests it should be played).

Docks a few points because it really needs more reference sheets and the cardstock for the action decks is pretty weak (time to get some sleeves), but other than that my initial opinion is very favorable.


A second playthrough holds my opinion...this is a great hybrid, serves its license well (in terms of a civ-building real-time strategy game), is pretty thematic, has screw-your-neighbor and military aspects, different paths to victory...I really dig this game.  Heavily underrated.

The positive of this game is in the components, Age of Mythology is a decent looking title but that is all that grabbed me.  In an attempt to mix euro with war gaming mechanics I believe Age fails.  The ideas are interesting, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  I was in a four player game and one player became practically moot, as his position was always attacked and he never had enough to rebuild.  I have a feeling this game is a  broken, but future plays would find this claim more substantial - however, I don't see this ever getting played again as there are so many other games that sit above this one on the to play list, including ones I actually enjoy.

Very interesting mash up of American (i.e. miniatures slugfest) and European (i.e. resource management) influences set in the Egyptian/Norse/Greek mythos.  [Titan meets Settlers of Catan perhaps?]  Clever action card mechanic that allows options to grow as the game progresses.  Beautiful components considering this game is circa 2003.  Trying hard as they did, the battle system and the rest of the game are still somewhat disjointed IMO.  Perhaps this board game needs an actual "board" centerpiece to bring it all together.  Overall, not a bad game.

Paper/Scissors/Rock with an element of chance (dice).  Good for wargamers and family gamers alike.  Only gripes are downtime and ganging up.  Both avoided in the 2-player game.

What is this mess. An all-attack strategy sets off a runaway leader problem making 2-player games all but worthless and that isn't even the worst of it. The battles themselves are an overly long and dull mix of paper-rock-scissors and dice rolling. Level of chance: very high. Level of skill: low.

So sue me for liking this game. It sure has its flaws, but at the same time it is really fun to play. It's a nice looking game, has great theme and the general game play is good (selecting and playing cards). I have two problems with it. First, the combat has problem. Even without analysis paralysis, there are too many units to choose from, takes too long to resolve large battles. The second problem is that it feels too one-dimensional and too few ways to victory.

Played 5  Played 2, 3 & 4 players prefer 3 player. Game length is 1 hour per player but varies quiet a bit depending on the number of battles fought, a 3 player game can last 5 hours. AofM looks good. The rules are easy to grasp. I had this game a couple of weeks before I got the opportunity to play and I was filled with anticipation. After 3 games I think the game is annoyingly flawed but enticingly playable! Why did the designer not notice that sending a unit berserk makes practically no sense? Why build a wall? The game system encourages hitting the weaker player. Putting victory cubes on the won last battle card is not usually a good idea. I don't have a problem with the combat except that it so rarely makes sense to engage in it. It seems that most gamers have pet theories about how the rules should be changed. There is a lot to like about Age of Mythology, it plays at a good pace, it appeals to a wide audience, it looks and feels "meaty". *UPDATE* I have given this game too harsh a wrap, it holds up well to competitive play, I have moved my rating up to a 6. The rules feel like they need tinkering with but they are just fine as they are. I am keeping my earlier comments because my initial instincts to tinker with the system seem to match the initial views of others, unnecessary as I now consider that to be. I will only play this with 3 players. May 05

It's like Puerto Rico, except with armies!  What's not to like?  Except...I didn't like it.  Combat was too random, the races seemed unbalanced, and the tension of fighting over scarce resources (like Puerto Rico) is nearly nonexistent.  I did like the customizable VP conditions, though.

This could have been an excellent game, albeit very derivative of "Puerto Rico" (up to the point that the buildings have no pictures). The proven role-selection mechanic works very well, while the addition of combat makes it an interesting Euro-Ameritrash hybrid. Also, with 180 plastic miniatures and beautiful artwork on the cards and player boards, it has no lack of visual appeal. However, two major flaws really hurt the gameplay.

Let's start with the combat system: the rock-paper-scissors mechanic isn't too bad, but you can make the right choice every time and still lose due to the extreme randomness of rolling sixes on a varying number of dice. It also takes much too long. Rolling just two dice and adding the unit's strength would have been quicker and less random. Not surprisingly, this has become a popular unofficial variant.

Then, there is the allocation of victory points every round by the players to four cards with different victory conditions. It sounds good in theory, but in practice you usually go for one of the victory cards the whole time, maybe deviating occasionally to the card that gives points to the winner of the next battle (if you are ready to attack an opponent). Also, if a majority of players decide to go early for the same victory card, that victory condition will usually decide the game. And I only say "usually" instead of "always" because, in case of a tie for most buildings or largest army (two of the victory cards), the tied players get no victory points - an artificial and poor way to guarantee that every player has a chance to win until the end.

Despite the flaws, I still enjoyed the game and kept it in my collection for many years, but the three-hour playing time and awful scoring system meant it rarely got to the table, so I eventually sold my copy.

2 hours, yeah right?!?!?  This game took us about 6 hours on our first play (including frequent rules checks, none of us had played), and I don't think it would get much shorter (we didn't even finish, we still had 2 or 3 turns worth of VPs to go).  The battles took ages, and one player was just left sitting there, doing nothing.

Jeu trop long.   Encore un jeu d’échange de cubes avec une portion de combats archaîques à la Risk. Combats avec des dés traditionnels (le plus de 6 remporte). Chacun joue de son côté et ne se soucie pas de ce que l’autre fait. Tour assez long. Peu d’interractions entre les joueurs. Difficile de remonter la pente quand on est en arrière avec une armée affaiblie. Thème pas vraiment attirant pour moi. Pas vraiment mon type de jeu. J’ai regardé l’horloge pendant les 3 heures qu’ont duré le jeu.

Having finally taken the plunge and given this a go I really don't like the combat system. I also am not convinved that the ballance is right for 4 players (two players sharing a deck of random cards can leave one getting the bad cards and the other the good ones) also if there is one pair of players they will tend to pump up each others economy by constantly producing the same terrain (say fertile or desert for Egypt or mountains for Norse)

Not keen on the fact that nearly all the scoring comes at the end of the game.

If I play again it will be with one of the alternate combat rules and probably with the suggestion I saw that most buildings and largest army are scored at the end of each age.

I have now sold my copy

Probably the first relatively gamergeek game I owned.

It was a random gift when I was 15 when my Dad knew I was keen on getting it (I played the computer game). It was instantly a hit with me and my four close buddies from school. We would play it till 5am in the morning.

The game has a decent of military and economics. However, perhaps it may be due to my misinterpretation of the rules, but somehow I found that once you lose your entire army, you're subject to endless torment.

I haven't played it with any of my friends here in Singapore as I'm not sure how many of them are patient enough to learn the game

What I like:
The awesome figurines! I enjoy building up and admiring my diverse army so much that I'm reluctant to bring them to battle.

Too random, and over-produced: the plastic figures could have been replaced by cards, which would have been much more ergonomic.  And with the spared money, they could have designed decent tiles.
edit:
Age of Mythology suffers from under development - it's full of good ideas, but combat is cumbersome and boring, it does not work with more than 3 players....  It's a missed opportunity, but the euro-american mix would turn a huge success formula for Glenn Drover.

RATING: 4
I enjoyed the Permanent/Random deck mechanic as well as the nice components, and the interesting resource system.

The combat system has unfortunately soured my experience with this game.

IMHO, they would have been better off with a system similar to Axis & Allies, as I cannot understand how 1 or 2 units can wipe out an opposing army of 6 units, repeatedly.  This is not to mention that the players not engaged in the battle have nothing to do until the end of combat, which can last 5-10 minutes, as combat is conducted 1 unit at a time.

This approach provides an unfair advantage to better units, as it removes the possibility of overwhelming them with cheaper units (i.e. there can be no strenght in numbers with this system).

Last but not least, I'm not interested in playing Rock-Paper-Scisors for 2 hours.

There is fun to be had with this game, but it requires just the right circumstances. You need exactly two or three players. These players must be of the disposition to enjoy fairly in-depth economic engine building and also to enjoy outrageous turns of fortune in the same game. Do you know many people like that? I don't. In fact, I'm usually not one of those people. But every once in a great while this hits the spot.

The game is pretty good. Imagine Puerto rico with a much larger luck factor and some combat. it's not withough flaws though: 
- It takes twice as long to play a 2 player game than Puerto Rico. Playing a game under an hour is completely out of the question
-There's just a single copy of the "quick reference", a must to be able to play effectively the first dozen times.
- The bits, while plentiful, aren't quite up to what Rio Grande's standards. The cards are somwhat flimsier than I would like, and the tiles aren't properly perforated: damaging them while taking them out is pretty easy. I'd have Puerto Rico or Carcassone's tiles any day.

All in all, it's still worth playing, just don't try to play twice back-to-back.

When I think of broken games, this one-time experience comes to mind from a long time ago. It's still clearly vivid in my mind as one of the worst gaming experiences I have ever had.

There's plenty of chrome in this game, lots of plastic fantasy miniatures, cool graphics, and interesting theme. 

It seemed like Risk in a mythological setting of Ancient Greece, in the time of Homer. So, I thought generating a lot of units would be key to winning battles. Wrong. Despite having overwhelming number of units, the game forces the players to select one unit and send it out for a one-on-one death match, while the other units sit idly by. I watched my units get hacked to pieces one-by-one, by a single powerful unit on the other side. Once an opponent is able to generate such a unit, it is impossible to stop it, unless you keep up with your opponent(s). Even then, if two such units get matched up in battle, it is a dice-rolling contest. The side that rolls poorly will lose its one powerful unit and then is literally defenseless; adjacent areas will subsequently get conquered because there are no units able to stop it. This breaks the game. Never will I play this again. Rating: "1". Broken. Broken. Broken.

RATING: 7.5
Strangely simple for a boardgame emulating the full spectrum of a strategy game's features, but it does achieve it! You'll be producing villagers and assigning them to resources on your personal map which you can spend an action to explore, you use the resources to build buildings that will improve your economy (mostly), gather units with which to attack the enemy's city, and fight with those units for final victory! You can even build a wonder but I never was that sort of player.

It's quite fun, not extremely but I'm certainly happy with what they managed. The disappointment for some is the dice rolling, though agreeably it is quite balanced and very representative of the units, and I think it is actually quite a good implementation/mechanic. For me the ever so slight disappointment is that it's designed for 2-3 players but you may find it a bit tough trying to play with a odd number of players, as you don't want to gang up against one or the other. We got around this with an "each one attacks to his right" rule which worked all-right actually, but I would still like them to make 4 players really feasible out of the box rather than with the expansion (you might find yourself in need of some more soldiers or resources).

I honestly can't single out any good point as spectacular, nor can I point the finger at any downside though, it's a well-rounded game that does a good job living up to its title, I have no idea why it misses the mark of making people really eager to play it again and again, it's a really good game.

Keeps players' interest because the game often comes down to the wire before a winner emerges.

Un Eurotrash algo más americano que Age of Empires III con civilizaciones, gestión de recursos, combate y poderes asimétricos. Lo tiene todo, así que no sé cómo no me gusta más. Criticado por "parecerse mucho a Puerto Rico pero con combate" (¿¡!?)Sin dejar de ser cierto, no encuentro tanto parecido en las sesaciones que deja tras jugarlo. Sólo en dos de las acciones que se pueden hacer son parecidas (recolectar y explorar), el resto, reclutar, construir... no tanto. Sin ser un juego excelente, con la debida rotación típica de una colección grande como la mía, resulta divertido. Me encanta la mecánica de elegir la aleatoriedad que quieres (puedes elegir las acciones del mazo de acciones fijas o del mazo de acciones aleatorias). PROS: Buenas dosis de combete y económico. Con la variante de 5's y 6's son éxito, el combate es mejor. CONS: Falta de diseño gráfico en los edificios. Combate en plan piedra - papel- tijera muy criticado. No es táctico (no hay movimiento de tropas). OJO: que para remediar todo esto hay material en BGG...

The downtime during battles, long playing time required, and a feeling that the first turn is &quot;scripted&quot; (you HAVE to build up your army ASAP or you will lose to an arms race and other players&#039; attacks) keeps my gaming group from wanting to play it regularly.

Over the past decade I've played this once every year or two, and it's definitely grown on me. I especially like the card selection process and the placement of victory point cubes. Some people have pointed out that the plastic figures are unnecessary--you could just use cards--but they add a visual coolness factor that adds to the appeal. What other game has plastic mummies, minotaurs, frost giants, etc., etc. This is a game I'll be hanging on to and enjoying for years to come.

With all the bits, it takes almost as long to set it up as it does to play :).  There is a lot a to like about this game, but two things killed it for me: (1) the abstract and annoying combat system, and (2) the games seem to end just as things get rolling, so I leave the table still hungry (although not for more Age of Mythology).

I've now played the game a dozen or more times and have an even better appreciation for it.  It's an intensely difficult game when playing against good players.  In my group a player that passes more than twice will have a very hard time winning.  Counting 5s & 6s as hits makes for combat that is tense but predictable enough that careful consideration of the odds generally pays off.  Aside from one blow out game, I've never been bored for a second playing this game.

I really enjoy the mechanics of choosing actions in this game: when choosing your action cards, you can select known action cards or risk taking some random (but more powerful) action cards.  The building/gathering aspect of this game is similar to Puerto Rico, which is a plus.  A fun game that has a lot of atmosphere and nice bits.  The rating loses one point because of its cheesy random combat system, although it's fun to try to out-bluff your opponent.

It's clear that the designers wanted to emphasize the combat mechanics, but unfortunately, I find that the rewards of victory do not match the amount of effort that goes into the fights. They take a bit too long for me.

Other than that, it's a nice empire building game. I really like the two personal decks...the "guaranteed but weaker actions" and the "potentially powerful but random actions".

Working design, but clearly not in my type.
Too long and too cumbersome battles.

[in addition, huge snowball effect showed up in my only (2-player) game; get the poorer resource tiles than your opponent at the beginning and you are screwed...]

RATING: 5
I admit, I played it only once. But it's enough for me to know that I have no interest in it. Will probably never play it again. Just not my kind - too many unit types and too complicated battle engine. And battle is not very important in the game - it rarely pays off.

RATING: 7
Marred by a flawed endgame, where you can wind up in a position where all you can do is choose who wins.  Were it not for that, this would rate higher.  Still winds up being a fun experience, although I'm not wild about the four player game.

I enjoy playing this game, but I think the combat is broken.  I don't play often enough to explain how exactly, but I'm interested in finding an alternate combat mechanic.

That aside, the board is beautiful and the economics mechanics are great!

edit:  on our last play with exactly three people, it seemed to work fine... more plays will help me understand...

Take a little bit of Puerto Rico, a little bit of Axis&Allies, and a popular theme and you get AOM. I can imagine the standard deviation will be pretty high on this game, but I personally love the game. It plays best with three players, it's ok with four too but not good with just two players as the first loser of a battle will spend the rest of the game just trying to catch up. I would rate this a 9 if not for the major luck factor of the dice and the fact that it only plays well with 3 or 4 players. Also, I've seen too many heros fall to mortals. Some people have an issue with the fact that there's no board but that never mattered to me very much.

I had fun with my first play, but we didn't have much fighting in the game.  If there had been more fighting, I might not have liked it as much.  We only had three or four battles and all of them against the same person.  She didn't like that very much, but she was ahead so we had to do it.  (It was a three player game.)  As it was, nobody took the end-game VPs, and I ended up winning 4-3-0.  The person who had been leading for most of the game was tied for both most buildings (with my other opponent) and largest army (with me) but scored no points.

RATING: 6
The battle system takes a while to figure out.  Unfortunately, I could not role well the entire game.  This left me behind.

Also, the dynamics of this game seem to encourage picking on the losing player to help the stronger one.  this can lead to an abysmal experience for the losing player.

Eric. A game with alot of ideas.  However, they don't work so well together.  The combat system renders the rest of the game largely unplayable.  Its an interesting experiment but not worth playing if you can avoid it.  It gets some points for being best at 3 players.

Needs a minor house rule to reduce the luck in combat a little (hits on 5's and 6's), but I pretty much like everything else as it is.  I would rather play with 3 or 2 players.  I can't see playing this with more than 4.

Age of Mythology is a mixed bag. I like the concept and mechanics, but the combat system is punishing. The player who loses the first battle has little hope of recovering. This feels like a game that is a quick fix or two away from greatness, but the RAW result in a sub-optimal experience.

Edit: After playing three times at different player counts, I'm bailing on this game. It is not worth the trouble of trying to fix.

RATING: 7
The game is quite fun to play, but I am worried about replayability (lack of different strategies to pursue) and the fact that everything comes down to the final round and an all or nothing victorypoint structure. I have played it three times, and it is quite fun. There are few battles in our games cause it just isnt worth it (unless someone is beaten down and is being picked on)

RATING: 2
I wasn't impressed with this one. The ability to build part of your hand of cards each turn is neat but the randomly drawn cards can really impact how your turn goes(suprise). I also found the combat system very clunky. Each troop has its own abilities while some troops are better/worse vs other troops. All of this can be found on a couple summary sheets but even that is a hassle. This helps to slow the game down as does the combat which is several rounds of rolling dice to determine which troops get killed. Clunky & Slow. Great bits though.

RATING: 7
Horribly under-rated.  Guys, please rate using the rule that you hit on 5s and 6s, not just 6s.  The game is obviously better that way, and the change has the designer's endorsement.  One nice thing about AoM is that you can alter the length of the game simply by adjusting the number of VP cubes at the start.  I tried with 21 cubes (7 rounds) instead of 30 and it worked fine - game clocked in at exactly 2 hours.  Yes, it IS clunky and very unslick - Drover is the anti-Knizia (and I admit a far inferior designer) - but direct combat games appeal to me and this works as well or better than most of them.  Biggest problem seems to be kingmaking, but I will have to wait for more plays to decide if its a serious or minor problem.  I would really like another VP option - something like 'first to reach the next age' - that would be a nice goal in between the very short-term of 'won last battle' and the end-of-game goals.  Anyway, AOM is genuinely fun, which is more than I can say for many 'clever' eurogames (Amun-Re, I'm looking at you).  Three player is by far the best - four is possible but the downtime gets a bit much.

Excellent resource game with a light combat system overlaid. Armies are built to acquire or protect resources, and you need to balance a strong army with resource gathering.

I like the feel of this game where you decide to build up your city, harvest resources, create more troops, do battle, etc. Good bits and medium set up time. But the problem is that with 3 players, it almost becomes a group think type of game. If two players go after each other, by the time they are done, the third player mops both of them up.  So the game experience relies (in my opinion), too heavily on the players understanding the balance needed.

[Lowered Rating - Game slows down significantly with 4 or more players] Very replayable. Lots of fun. I only have minor complaints about it. It needs storage compartments, because separating the pieces can be a bit tedious. And an age marker, because after a few games back to back, you tend to lose track of where you are.

Combat is definitely the weak point since it slows down the game for players who aren't participating.

Played a 4-player game that lasted for 5 hours. After 2 hours I was pretty sure I wasn't going to win. For the last 1½ hours I and the player next to me very only trying to co-operate to end the game. During the last hour I only had 3 turns, mostly due to the utterly stupid and too much time taking combat system. That pretty much sums it up for me. Boardgames are supposed to be fun, at least for me.

Game length (4 or 5 hours) is a huge barrier to playing this.  Though, with less of a new player than I am, I would guess game time might shorten.  At least I hope it would.

I'd really like to give this game a 7, but because of its combat system - which does not appeal to me - it can only get a 6.
Also, I find that the lacking differences between cultures makes this game much more dull than the computer version. With different terrain types for the cultures, why not let that show itself in the prices for buildings and units too?

I had a surprisingly good time with his game! Originally I picked it up because 1) it was cheap and 2) I have very fond memories of AoM on the PC. As such I assumed I had just picked up a collectible.
But yeah, pleasant surprise! The game's fast (besides combat), offers real "fuck yeah!" moments and has lots of lovely bits.
Luck is a pretty big factor (though there's a variant that apparently fixes this [kinda] for combat + makes it faster).But with the way the Eras work this feels like part of the design so... I don't really mind? 

+1 point for sheer nostalgia.

2 plays now.  I like this game.  Second game was closer than the first and we are all still getting used to the mechanics.  Sure the combat is a little luck heavy - but I don't feel it detracts from the game as much as many do.  I definitely prefer the hit on 5 or 6 variant to the it only on a 6 variant.  Speeds combat along and makes for slightly less wild results.

First impressions:
Seems like a fun strategy game, especially for 3 players. The races play somewhat different, but overall it seems to be very well balanced. One interesting element is having the choice to give up planning reliability for more powerful but random options.

Potential problems might be:
- The huge luck factor in battles
- If one player takes a harsh defeat, it is probably the best move for all other players to beat down the poor guy again and again which might lead to a lot of frustration (this is just something I suspect, has not happened in my first game)

This is a really fun game to play, lots of choices and strategies to consider.  Too bad Eagle only allowed for up to 4 players without the expansion.

I have thought that a possible way to "fix" this game, if it even needs it, would be to score the victory points every round or two so that there are short term goals players can go after and won't be totally let down and screwed by a horrible last round or two.

I just bought this game.  If you like Puerto Rico you will love this game.   It plays almost exactly the same but it gives you a lot more options.   There is a mild randomness to the game but you can choose how much radomness you want as an individual player.   It's the closest game I've ever played to Puerto Rico which is my all time favorite game.   This is an A+, easy to learn, the strategy is a little more involved - I think you have to play a few times to get in a zone.

After first games I attended this game too much good. I played 2 and 3 persons and the contest was interesting: here we will build something, a little we will gather raw materials, we will hire soldiers etc. After last two tournament my enthusiasm dropped. I played 2 and 4 persons and in sum the boredom. To attack not it is proper, because anyway this excessively will not harm opponent, points for the greatest army one can gain building at end of the game the mass of most cheaper units, similarly with buildings, so much that then we place how much he will surrender houses for villagers. At 4 players it went to die from the boredom. Generally anyway not it is proper to play Age of Mytchology in more than 3 persons. The game a lot gains after the introduction of several houmrules as: during the battle fight all units simultaneously and following eras give the access to more strong units (one cannot buy all from the beginning of the game).

I would normally have given this game a 10 rating. It uses my favorite genre of cultural folklore mixed into not only a resource/build game but a combat game too. 

However, the battle is WIDELY based on luck... Out of the many games played it is very common to see whole armies of giants taken out by A 'soldier #1' type unit. That just leads to frustration when you can be punished for playing the game strategically and correctly.

Also, there does seem to be a problem OCCASIONALLY of bad draws. It is possible to have a string of awful luck where badly needed resource tiles, and action cards are grossly needed in comparison to the opponents. 

These two problems aren't breaks in the game, but it does make me wonder if I'm playing a test-beta game at times. Therefore my rating must be brought down a notch.

My gaming group has adapted the god power cards and the combat system where myths hit on a five and heroes hit on a 4. It's helped to a certain extent.

After I have played this game 7+ times I must say that this game surprises me over and over again. I thought there was a winning strategy (largest army and chicken out of fights) but I was soo wrong. The strategy of the game keeps changing with the placement of the red cubes and the victory are rarely definite until the very last round of the game. Most of the times you will have to play a very balanced game to win, but other times you will have to be lucky in battles - it's all about placement of the victory cubes deceided by the players. The battle makes the game seems a bit random, but only a fool will go to war if he doesn't consider the consequences - you can loose no matter how big your army is and you still have a chance to win if your army is a little weaker. It feel a bit like Puerto Rico, but PR lacks the tension of battles and PR seems sometimes a bit too rigorously compared to AoM. It's a bit hard to explain the greatness of this game if you haven't play it 5 times or more.

A long affair, not particularly well balanced and overall awkward.  A wargame without a map, with individual boards like Puertorico, that takes forever to resolve with the occasionnal fluke that someone can be eliminated very early.  It's not "bad" per se, there are just many better games out there and it's way too long for what it is.

Most of the game is action management. So you must try to anticipate what actions you might need and how much rick you are willing to take to get more powerful actions.

I always played this game at 2 players but apparently it only play well at 3-4. With 2 players you end up short in resources.

One of the problem in this game is that it is very long especially if you have a lot of players. Another thing that I don't like is the fact that there is some mind games to do in battle and I hate that.

Now people on BGG have submitted a lot of variant ideas. I picked up a few of these and added a few of my own and in general, it makes the game more interesting and faster. Which is a good thing if you want to play with 5-6 players.

So with the variants, it's OK, else there might be some elements that you find annoying.

By the way, the game supply most of the components to play at 5-6 but there are some other missing components that requires you to buy the expansion. Still except for the missing resources cubes, I think there would be enough tiles to play with 6 players without much problems. So if you can get the missing cubes, it might be enough.

RATING: 4
A bit tedious, particular in combat although I do appreciate the aspect of combat in the game.  Much more of a resource management game than one about conflict.  If you are the first one to be beaten in a battle, you are more than likely to be toast as you will be raided like crazy.

RATING: 4
Played this twice; the second time was to confirm some suspicions -- mainly, that the combat, which is key to this game, is dull and somewhat broken. Dull because there's a lot of rock-paper-scissors to it and because although the little plastic figures look nice, they give you zero info that you need for combat. Cards with their battle info on them would be far more useful. (That is, instead of giving you X little plastic elephant people, give you X elephant people battle cards.) In addition, the three sides are not balanced well: Egypt's heroes don't seem to be worth their cost to get out. Seige engines are ridiculously underpriced in the game considering the advantage they give to their owner. All in all, this was a long, not overly exciting game in which the play that was there never distracted me enough from the play that should have been there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
To me, the game doesn't know what to do with itself - it's a combat game (look at all the cool minis!) but not really, because combat depletes armies, which are needed elsewhere. I've never played a game where the person who attacked the most, won. Maybe it's more like Puerto Rico -- no, there's no 'contesting' over the roles. Until it decides what it wants to be, the game is only a 5 in my book.

Epic battles? Another game kit? With changes this game is great fun. I hate to rate a game so well which requires changes, but I put much work into it and enjoy it. Play with a version of the Battle Line variant - this does not turn the game into a combat game, nor make combat more likely - it just makes combat less stupid.

Best with 3 players.  4 also works alright.  With 2 players getting back from a deficit is nearly impossible, and is still quite difficult in three and four players.  Lots of variety.  Wish the figures were more easily distinguisable.  The rest of my gamegroup likes this game more than I do.  Though I might bring it out again this week now that I'm commenting on it.  The 5-6 player expansion really could have been part of the core box.  This is a game I find myself getting upset with when I play and fall behind.

I haven't played this game enough to stand by my rating of it.  I've played it once, and it was a 4-player game, and there were two things I didn't like about it that stuck out.  First, it was too long between turns due to dice chucking battles.  Secondly, each of 3 races has a rock-paper-scissors like advantage over each other, and in a 4 player game, only 2 races are played, so one race has an unreciprocated advantage over the other.  A 3-player game with all 3 races might completely fix both of these things I didn't like about the game; it didn't seem like the game was really broken like some other Eagle Games I've played recently.

Game can be quite fun... kinda of "Puerto Rico Lite" in a way, with a fantastical theme.  

Nice minis (I'd give them a solid "B+"), really nice wooden cubes (give them an "A"), so-so tiles and mapboards, decent cards, maybe a "B-" rulebook.

There does seem to be a little problem with the Egyptian mummies being to powerful/cheap/easy to make early.

Would play again for sure, but maybe not before some other titles.

I don't mind the dicerolling at all (since combat isn't too important, though I think the houserules posted here using fives and sixes seems to work better than the original rules.

Lots of luck to manage for a Euro and a lot of resource management for Ameritrash, but somehow it all seems to work. I don't mind the  rock-paper-scissors combined with lots of fire rolls resolution for combat, though I can understand those who don't.  The mechanic of players allocating victory points each turn is brilliant.

Play only with three and use the hit on 5 and 6 variant.   I also like the sound of the temple variant, where you are allowed to purchase your victory point from the victory cards as well as the supply.  Overall, I think this game has gotten a bad rap.

This is one of those games that I enjoy despite its flaws.  On the plus side it is nice development game, with a reasonably balanced set of options.  It's mechanisms are nicked from PR but fairly well implemented.  The figures are nice, the boards and cards are attractive and interesting.  The activities fit well with the theme of civilisation development.  Placing victory points on your chosen victory condition is a new mechanism (at least to me) and a good one.

The downside is the combat system.  Not only is it a rock/paper/stone variant but I find it tedious to do all the cross checking to make sure that I actually buy the right creatures to have at least a chance of winning against a given opposing army.  It is reasonably easy to sidestep battles, which is its redeeming feature.

Overall, an enjoyable game with annoying features; an occasional game rather than a regular.

a lot of odd things going on in this game.  The first one that struck me was how it tries to say it can play more than 3 players. For some reason you have the boards to play 6 but youd have half the guys and not enough cubes and something where you could go 4 but you need an expansion or something.
Its all messed up but seems fun enough that I'm trying some of the fan made additions to go past 3 players and pnp this into a great game.

The mechanics are a little off but still seem to work well enough.
Quality is nice but building tiles are bland for an unknown reason.  Box is an unconventional size.

still trying to figure out the game though.  It seems like getting a monster and attacking  is so much more worthwhile than buildings to the point to make them nearly worthless.  part of it is due to me playing it two player but idk, it just seems like that first major battle decides the game quite difinativly.

Overall I like it, I'm just a bit mad at it.
seems considerably better with more players as picking on the weakest doesn't pay off all that mcuh

     Well it's not a tactical game in that there is no troop movement and such, but this game is unique and quite fun.  Resource management is abound.  Also, the combat is filled with oppurtunities to second guess your opponent's strengths, making the game dramatic and thrilling.  Luck of the draw is a factor, but just the right amount of luck can add an element of much needed surprise, no?  Plus, this keeps you altering your strategy almost constantly and the end of the game is seldom predictable.  A blast.  The  flaw is some heavy unbalance in the factions and random resource generation which keeps this game from being far from perfect.

Very entertaining, several wonderful ideas, and it looks incredible, of course. After the first game (which we did not finish due to time constraints) I changed the combat system to 2d6, which worked a helluva lot better in the second game. About the only thing that bugs me now is all-or-nothing approach to victory points for the largest army/biggest city, but I'm not sure whether to try out an alternative before another game with the normal rules. Plays well with two players, or at least did so in the one game we tried, but three seems to be the sweet spot for this one.
Played 5+ times.

RATING: 5.919
Reminds me a lot of Puerto Rico with tile management, but much larger player boards.  Components are sturdy and colorful.  The combat system is a dice-fest, and can be equal parts grueling and boring at the same time.  This could have been improved by adding another culture instead just three to make it a true four-player experience, instead of teams.  Overall, a not-bad game that will probably see repeat play, but perhaps not a great deal of it.

We owned this but traded it away after playing it only two or three times.  Worst...game...ever.  Took four hours to set up, another two to read the rules, and then actually playing was a 3-hour ordeal.  We usually like turn-based combat, but the battles were excruciating, each player double- and triple-guessing themselves trying to predict what the other would play.  Nothing about it was actually fun.  Huge investment, no reward.

Potentionally a very good game. It has many ingredients I like: Simple card and dice driven combat using distinct fighting units with complex properties, outguessing your opponents, building an infrastructure, harvesting resources, simultaneous action selection, etc.

It is your the scoring mechanism that leaves me unsatisfied in the end....
(all that work, for so little: I want to have the feeling that I have achieved something in the end, even when coming dead last. I don't want to come second in a four-player game on tie breaker, with 0 points.)

Little plastic Medusas!  Little plastic Medusas!  And Mummies!!

A nicely-designed game, and the best ruleset yet (at its time) from Eagle Games.  Great miniatures, a reasonable approximation of the computer game experience (although you rarely see anyone building houses in the board version).

The combat system as written is chaotic and random, and should be kept that way.  To me the unlikely defeat of a mighty giant or monster by a lowly mortal fits the theme, and the randomness of the combat system is just about the only game element that even mildly discourages players from making easy pickings for the remainder of the game of whoever loses the first combat.

I have yet to play this with a group,so this rating could vary.I especially like the 'bidding' for victory points,and the variable ending of the game.As some have noted,the plastic bits,while nice,don't really appear to be necessary.The same could be said,however,of the wooden bits in most German games--they could be easily replaced by cardboard to make for a cheaper game,but,like the plastic men in AoM,they make the game more attractive to the players.I think AoM will be a good one for my friends,who like Risk better than abstract games.The mechanics seem good,and I like the combat system,which is not unlike the system in the upcoming computer game 'Warlords IV'.This game is much easier to play than I initially thought looking over the rules.I'd like to see a game on this subject using a tile based or geomorphic board system.I've knocked ths down to a '6',just due to personal taste.The game feels like a mish mash of various game systems to me,rather than an original design.

After my first game of AoM, I find it is indeed Puerto Rico with combat. Beautiful pieces, reasonable rules and simply play. Plenty of choices. Downside (some see this as a big downside) is the downtime players have when combat is started between two players. 2nd play was a tie for a win for me and another player. Only had one round of combat in the entire game. Seems to play differently with each game.

Oh boy, little pieces! Little wooden blocks! Card driven game play!  Great set of rules! That would normally be a 9 or 10 rating, but even though I enjoy this game quite a bit, there seems to be something missing.  I can't put my finger on it, but it may be the combat system is a little too simplistic for me; it seems this game deserves something a little more epic (like a set of battle cards).  Yes, yes, I know, it's not a "war game", but making the battles more interesting would have put my rating over the top.

I really wanted to like this game because of it's attempt to integrate Puerto Rico-like elements, because it's a resource management game, and because it's got great bits.

Now about the bits.  You would think that I'd be enamored by the plastic miniatures, but I actually think they were unnecessary.  Too often I found myself trying to cross reference the creature chart against my neighbor's miniatures.  Although it could be done, it was a bit of a chore.  In my opinion, it should be easy to absorb all known information; players are already burdened enough by trying to plan and strategize and make countless analytical decisions without having to decipher know facts.  It would have been less expensive and easier to set up if the publisher had simply printed the creatures out on cards containing all the relevant facts.  The game already takes over twice as long as Puerto Rico to properly set up.

Futhermore, the game affords too much to chaos.  The random cards and the combat element both acting as major contributors.  I have a pet peeve with German styles games that attempt to integrate warfare.  Usually, this just makes the peace-loving players the most likely to win.  Basically, I love a game where even if you're ganged up upon, you can still pull off a win.  Puerto Rico accomplishes this wonderfully.  Age of Mythology does not.

In fairness to Age of Mythology, if you like games involving the diplomacy and chance involved in games of warfare (a la Risk) and you like Puerto Rico (resource management games), this game will be right down your ally.  (In any case I would be open to trying this one again.)

RATING: 6.5
Really cool economic management/wargame for 2-players (haven't tried with more), if a little long. I like the way the different victory conditions get "bid" on, although I get the feeling that a really good designer could've selected slightly cooler/more nuanced/angst-filled goals. Combat is incredibly fiddly and complicated for what comes down to essentially rock-paper-scissors, although it does replicate the way units work in the computer game.

RATING: 7
There are many things to like about the game. There are also a few things to dislike, starting with the long playing time. Next, the combat can last a while and is much less exciting for those not involved. You have to roll as many sixes as possible but even 10 dice can result in not a single six (actually happened). So the combat feels much like risk for me: fun and exciting at first but sometimes very frustrating and taking forever. Playing with 3, the 3th player is always the winner of any battle.

However, i Love most of the other stuff. Choosing your cards to play for that round, other players that can profit from your actions as well, choosing the buildings you built or units your recruit. The miniatures are really top-notch (compared to the games i played so far). There is always a lot going on. Mistakes are punished though. 

I will not keep this one. It feels wrong but I am sure it would be gathering dust instead of hitting the table. If you have the kind of gaming group that is into civiliazations and war this might be one of the better purchases. It offers variation cause each nation plays differently and there are several ways to victory. There is a lot of luck in the draw of the cards (and the throw of the dice) so you always have to adapt to what you get. If you can't cope with bad luck kicking you in the face, don't buy this game!

After the first play, I have my doubts about how balanced it is. It seems to me that the Greeks have a starting disadvantage when it comes to war and i'm not sure in what way that is compensated throughout the game (better hero's?). I could be wrong about that though.

RATING: 5
Pretty much a forgotten game at this point (2015) that no one plays anymore.

Maybe the "best game" published by the first iteration of Eagle Games since:  the game seemed to work, somewhat OK gameplay and wasn't "broken" right out of the box... unlike most of the dross that Eagle Games published at the time.

It's been a very long since I played the game, but I do recall OK quality minis and Eurogame like mechanics such as the role selection mechanic used in Puerto Rico.  Don't think this game would hold up very well compared to current games of a similar nature.

Don't remember especially liking or disliking the game, so a "5" it is.

This game is pretty cool, but a few mechanics needed more playtesting.  Early attacks can cripple a player (there should be an over all board to prevent the first turn "rush"), and there are too few options to pursue to win.  Despite this, it's still pretty fun, and I can see myself playing it again.  Maybe.

The first time I played this was when I took it to a group of friends who were into board games far more than I was. Needless to say they didn't let me pick the games after that. I tried the game years later with my son and it was still a miserable experience.I bought the game for the theme, but it doesn't come remotely close to capturing the feel of the PC title. The combat is terrible and far too random. The miniatures, despite looking quite cool, serve no purpose whatsoever. The final nail in the coffin is the obscene length, the game drags on far too long. I'd sell it, but I'd honestly feel bad dumping this on someone.

My 13 year old son is a big fan of the computer game and loves this game.  He seems to like any game with lots of plastic figures.  I was pleasantly surprised by the game design.  The combat system creates the most excitement, but long battles leave the other players with little to do.  My wife really enjoyed the strategic aspects of the game (which some have compared to Puerto Rico) but lost interest after several long battles.  I'm anxious to play again with some gamers.

A very good resource management game.  It you are expecting battling gods and a military smash & grab game, then try Risk: Godstorm.

An enjoyable resource management game.  However, it runs too long and the combat system needs a little tweaking - a hit on a roll of 5 or 6 (instead of just 6's) seems to be a popular house rule.  I find it odd that it is an empire building game, with the plastic bits being all combat units and the cardboard building tiles lack graphics.  I would rate this game higher if it didn't take so long to play.

Sort of a Risk variant but with much more meat.

Not a game I want to play all the time, but it does scratch that sort of 'Let-me-build-up-my-army-and-kick-your-ass' itch.

good game, however it has a steep learning curve. The initial set up of the game took an hour to remove from the packaging without breaking the models. after getting the game set up it took most of a play through for us to realize how the point distribution worked because the wording in the instructions was hard to understand. But after we got the game down it was very fun to play, it would be best to play with experienced board gamers.

Flawed, but fun with three players.  Many of this game's detractors claim that constantly attacking the weakest player and swiping five resource cubes at a time is a game-breaking approach.  For games with more than two players, this claim is utterly preposterous, as only the player doing it will attach victory points to winning battles.  The other(s) will earn them from having the most buildings and units, and maybe the Wonder as well, and win the game with very little difficulty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Defintely some fun to be had, but way too long for what essentially came down to a final round that turned on the order of play and drawing the right cards. Add in more randomness in the battles - both in choosing which creature to use and the dice rolling - and you have a long game that requires minimal skill to play competitively. While I do see why some compare this to Puerto Rico, it plays a heck of a lot more like Settlers. We played with 4 players, and I can see giving this another chance with 3, just because of time issues. I think I would rather pass if offered a chance to join an 5 or 6 player game.

RATING: 6
I recommend always playing with the "5s and 6s hit" varient.  My rating assumes that change and only playing 3p games.  There are some interesting things here (such as 'bidding' on the winning conditions) which, if refined, could make for a stellar game.  As it stands it is just okay.

Three different civilizations, tiles, gods and goddesses and fantasy units clashing in the battlefield at the mercy of rolling dice.  The hour-and-a-half game that would outstay its welcome if it were any longer.  Kept waiting for expansions.

Update: Haven't found the mood for this game again after discovering RACE FOR THE GALAXY which does a similar mechanic better and for mythical units fighting each other, there are also other games that do it in less time...Hour and a half plus setup is just longer than what I want for this game.

Update 2: Not that I own it anymore, but CYCLADES put the final nail on this game's coffin.

I really enjoy the flow of the game and the game pieces are very nice.  The downside is that the box seems incomplete.  There are only 3 civs so it feels a bit weird with 4 players and strangely there are 6 boards but not enough pieces to play with 6 players.

hmm - tricky one. I don't think it's a bad game - and on paper it should be good. Bags of unique troops, 3 different factions for a perfect 3 player game - but urg.  Something about the extreme rock/scissors/paper and units that when superceded are almost worthless makes army investment a dangerous strategy. Good mechanics in vp allocation, and it ticks the boxes for hunter/gathering/city growth but I don't think I want to play it again. Strange one.

I like it and the bits, but it's a bit too fiddly to keep, even with the two-dice combat system here on the Geek.  Would like to try with the variant of splitting the Largest Army card into two:  Largest Mythical/Heroic Army and Largest Mortal Population (mortal combat units and villagers).  Also like the variant that Temple trades may take VP cube from any card, not just the pool.  Maximum total resources seems too gamey and rubs me the wrong way (like the "loops" in Mission Command:  Air).  One could, I suppose just use all available cubes.  Gift to SAS.  Traded.

Call me a fanboy after several plays of this one. If it weren't for the length, I would play it far more often. I was surprised that a 3 player game did not feel that different from a 4 player game. There are plenty of decisions to be made and you do not get killed by an early error. It is not easy, but you can claw your way back into contention. Solid design and great components. Needs more and clearer player aids, though. If you have a problem with the lengthy dice rolling in the combat, try using the percentile charts here to reduce combat to one roll.

Strong card-dependancy seems to let this game down.  The theme is well fit, and you enjoy building your country, but many best laid plans fall to poor or mis-timed card draws.  The strength of the "god" powers are quite high, so this encourages you to work through your random deck.  However, it all depends on when you get the cards in order to actually see their full effectiveness.  The war aspect is nearly exactly like Sid. Mier's Civilization, which leads to some fun second guessing... but it also makes for some surprising war outcomes (one dwarf killed 2 Wyrms, a Cyclops and 3 Horsemen?).  Not terrible, but then again it seems like the winner is just determined by who happens to be having the better of the game at the time.  As with many wargames, the trick is to be winning at the end, and never along the way.  This fosters a lot of pandering to the other players and overall whining by everybody, not one of my favorite game mechanisms.

A good game that is best with 3 players. The game is well themed with good mechanics. It is quite easy to learn since it is divided into phases. The battles however are bad. Played with 2-4 players.

RATING: 4.5
This game has some very nice ideas. (One of which dissappoints; I'd have hoped the distribution of VPs on different goals would be more fun. However, it turns out to be rather straightforward and boring.)
Major drawback: The combat system has some flaws. First of all, combat takes to long. In addition, when a player's key defender has been killed, he can be attacked again and again before he gets a chance to rebuild (since the attacker can take away those resources needed to recrute the necessary units).

RATING: 4
In the Puerto Rico family; the games have somewhat similar mechanics.  AoM appears to offer more options (i.e. decisions).  The addition of the military adds another dimension.  The drawback is that the player(s) not involved in battle must wait.  There should be some greater benefit to advancing ages as it plays only a very small part.  Puerto Rico fans should enjoy this. After several plays something just doesn't feel right; the combat is screwy and no one EVER builds a wonder.

Mechanics are quite good, but there are two big problems here in my opinion:

2) 'beat on the weakest' aspect, terribly frustrating...

A potential quite good game ruined by a broken combat-system and a terrible 'beat on the weakest' aspect.
6 is my rate: taken as it is (--> a total blast) the game can be fun to play, components are good and I like the epic theme.

RATING: 2
Not much to like here. Hmm, nice plastic bits - too bad there isn't a game to go along with them.
 
The tile draw does not give much decision beyond do I pass on this one resource point now in the hopes of the getting a better one later. The resource drafting  - yawn. 
Different races with different powers that are way too unbalanced.
Too many types of units each with different costs makes recruiting complicated - looks good but you generally can't use them in a battle.
Victory conditions all but one are at the end of the game - shouldn't there be some intermediate scoring.
Combat system very slow and clunky as each unit individually fights. Can I roll a 6 better than you.

Intended for 3 player however doesn't work well as the first 2 in conflict push the game to the 3rd player, but game plays even worse for 4 player.

This is classic example of a game components that do not integrate very well, and make for poor gaming experience

RATING: 5.75
High toy factor with great looking miniatures.  It has the feel of Puerto Rico but with combat.  My problem with the game is that everyone will settle in and get a good rhythm going with their turns and then a battle will break out and for the next 5 to 10 minutes everything stops while two people roll off with a fistfull of dice trying to get 6s.  Perhaps I'll try it next time with the house rule of both 5s and 6s are hits.

Update:  Tried it with the 5 & 6 hit variant and it helped a little bit with the battles.  Overall I just don't think this is a great game.  The battles don't seem to fit into the game yet they can be key to your victory.  Numerous times I should have attacked someone but I didn't want to spend all that time working it out.  This would be a much better game if it took about an hour to 90 minutes.  There are much better 3 - 4 hour games that I would rather play than this.  Next time (which won't be for a while) I will try it with 6 or 9 victory point cubes removed so that it will end much quicker.

Update. I realized that I wouldn't play this again so it has been removed from the collection.  I still think it could have been great with the right variant.

This is my 2nd favorite Eagle... and the j*rk who gave it a "1" after playing "a couple of turns" should be ashamed of himself.  After many games, this game stands out for various reasons: each Culture plays a bit differently and each game can offer new surprises.  Makes for terrific replayability.  To reduce luck a little, our group scores Hits on 5 or 6, instead of just 6.  For us, that makes the perfect blend of skill, strategy and luck.  And, several of my gaming friends wifes like to the game too; a real plus!   Components Gorgeous.  Box says 2 hours to play but count on average 3.  Still, much shorter than some of their other games.

The game has many things I like. Many mythological units, kind of civ building (town), sides that have diffenrent powers. The game seems a bit half baked, it could use a second edition to get its rating much higher in my eyes.

Edit: Using variant rules

Another:

OK civilization game, if played with a variant (at least a few good ones). On its own the rating should be lower.

Gameplay moves quickly, and the only thing keeping it from being a 10 is the combat is a bit slow, but is an improvement over Sid Meier's Civilization.  As usual, it has the "quality" production which Eagle Games are known for.  It has a wide audience in my house, and both my 14yo son and my wife both enjoy it.  I took this game with me on a deployment (Coast Guard), and it was one of my gaming group's favorites.

This only gets played once a year or so, but it's a fun 5 or 6 hours.  Yes, that's how long it takes our group of three players.

I'm actually very surprised -- I usually dislike games taking too long, but I'm fine with this one.

Very enjoyable--smells like a Puerto Rico clone (though honestly I don't know how ultimately original Puerto Rico is)--then winds up adding some satisfying opportunities for more diverese strategy.

A mix of several different games. Although not as much like Puerto Rico as I thought it might be. Combat rules are simple bit I think that they mightbog the game down if there is lots of combat.

It sure feels like [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076]Puerto Rico[/url][/i] advanced, but the new features fully surpass the possible inheritance, cause they allow the existance of a very tense game full of player interaction, options and tough decisions.  My rating could go even higher, but I feel the game has many inconsistencies.  First, the all or nothing score system, which prevents a balanced development from having well deserved dividends, without mention that it also promotes the appearance of [i]kingmaker[/i] situations.  Players have then to bet early in the game, with little information, if they want to struggle for the largest army, for the largest city, or for a less common construction of a wonder.  This causes that players with superior performances may be surpassed by those who simply had the luck to bet for the winning horse.  Besides, the battle mechanic is way too long, kind of unbalanced and prevents the flow of play from being fluid enough.  There is also a problem with the parameters to mesure the largest city, since a clumsy town with many cheap buildings may beat a better built one full of great works of architecture.  And the same can be said about armies, since one made of cheap soldiers can beat other of great warriors and heroes.  To finish, I also feel the lack of a positional map to make the movement of troops visual.  I know we are talking about gods here, but the possibility of attack anyone anywhere with anything you have doesn't make any sense.

This is a fun, strategic, and beautiful game. The dicefest battles may be a bit tedious at times, but also generate the most whoops, hollers, and grumblings. My greatest complaint is that it should have come "complete" with sufficient pieces for six players and one reference card PER player. Otherwise a great game that allows the players to dictate the flow and flavor of the game. 
p.s. It's best played with 3 (I've tried 3,4 and 6).

update - dropped my rating from 8 to 6. Why? 4-6 player games stink - for a long, long time. The Egyptians are overpowered at the beginning-one friend refuses to play after the elephants ate his resources...and lands...and units... Oh, and his dog chewed up a Greek hero.

Played this a couple of times now. This game takes a hint from Puerto Rico and has actions which are very similar to those roles. It&#039;s grueling only being able to to finite things on your turn. The miniatures are wonderful and the rest of the bits are good. While combat is part of the game it is only one aspect. You participate in exploration, advancement, city construction, and harvesting. It&#039;s possible to win without fighting but you will need a powerful defense at the least. I highly recommend this one for your group.

By far one of the best Eagle games out there, the one that will most appeal to German board gamers.  Almost all agreed the mechanics were great, the only point of contention was the random battles.  Some didn&#039;t like how random they were, or how long they could take.

Other than that thumbs up all around.  The next time we play we plan on playing battles as such:
Most 6s wins.
If there are no 6s, most 5s wins, if no 5s, most 4s wins, etc.

We think this will not adversly affect the balance, and speed up combat a little by removing the ties.  Medusa would have to use the current combat rules.

A valiant effort to bridge the gap between American games and Euros.  Sadly for as fun as it can sometimes be, and for as nice of concepts and pieces are, there are just too many serious problems.  I really wish Eagle games would consider playtesting their games.

Huge endgame and beat on the loser issues, but could be solved by splitting VP's in ties for the former problem and not allowing VP's to be given when attacking the player with the weakest army for the later.  Without these fixes, I would only rate this as a 3.

Still though, the Rock Paper Scissors attack system combined with dice makes each battle outlast its welcome and ultimately the game suffers from the glutinous results.

I LOVE this game!  Still my favorite for the last few years since I first played it.  The battles can get long, making the game long as well.  Also due to the way victory points are won, the game can get off balance for the winner fairly easily.  So that some players have no chance of winning half way through the game and the best they can do is try to wronk the leader from winning.  Some "house rules" have been suggested on how to adjust VP winnings but we have yet to try them out yet.

I like the theme, the choice between sure permanent actions or better random actions, and the chrome of the units and buildings.  I dislike the all-or-nothing victory points, the amount of lookup you need to do to pick the best army, and the ease of getting your hard-won buildings destroyed.

My experience with games involving battles doesn't extend too far beyond Risk, Battle Cry, and Quebec 1759, so I'm not an expert.  I did enjoy the game, especially with the different paths you can take to victory.  However, the battle mechanic seems far too complex.  You almost need a computer program to figure everything out, then the actual resolution cn take a loooong time.  Maybe I'm too much of a novice at these types of games.  I enjoyed it nonetheless, but I have a feeling I'll discover better games in this genre.

It's been so long I barely remember playing it. I do recall that the nicely formed miniatures seemed a waste, like eagle was contractually obligated to include them in every game, needed or not. Miniatures need a map to roam on! Set them free!

update: playing it again really didn't change my opinion much. It's a good starting point for a game, but really needs an area control aspect to bring it all together.

RATING: 6.5
Man, how can you have 300 stunningly beautiful mythological miniatures and not have a large, lovely board for them to run around on, or even a decent combat system for them to fight with?  Having been a bit of an Age of Empires addict on the PC in the past, I was certainly expecting something different from this game.  It just goes to show, not every computer game translates well into a board game version.  But once I was able to set aside my expectations, I realized there was a pretty decent and intricately complex game in there.  It is a marvelously designed game which is very nearly ruined by a combat system that just plain sucks (which becomes even more clear when you see the number of battle variants that are in the forums for this game, including my own: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/312322), and which adds far, FAR too much time to the game length (to the point where, in one 4-player game, I was just wishing it would be over already, even though I ended up winning the game).  I don't often get angry when playing games, but there is something truly infuriating about successfully out-guessing your opponent in unit selection, having overwhelming odds in your favour, and not being able to roll a single bloody six.  The simplest fix you can do for this game is say that die rolls of 5 or 6 count as a hit.  But stay tuned, because I've got a HUGE variant in the works that will take all those lovely little plastic creatures and gives them a hidden world/map to explore.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Absolutely terrific game with smooth multi-layered game mechanics providing a lot of tactical decision making. I was first worried about rock-paper-scissors battle system but it proved to be more than just that. It&#039;s nice that all units in the game have specialities and such. Similarities with Puerto Rico can be found but in my opionion AOM takes the gameplay even further! It&#039;s great that you can affect other players gameplay more (combat) than in Puerto Rico. And another improvement is that now actions played by one player won&#039;t benefit other players (except Explorer and Gather). I hate it when I have to check how much I would benefit from something compared to how much others benefit from it.

There&#039;s everything in this game -- I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if I found this on the number one place in top-games list.

Plenty of luck but also a whole lot of strategy and tactics. The combat drags on very easily but I guess it will get quicker after more plays (and if that isn't enough, you can try some of the quick combat variations suggested here). The miniatures and bits are excellent altough there's almost too many of them (the game needs alot of table space). Not recommended for players who are afraid of dice and luck factors. Recommended for players who like epic empire building games (and love the mythology theme).

The presentation of this game can't be beat especially once you print off Von Epp's building tile sheet to replace the rather bland.

Downsides:
Too many dice for my liking.
Confused thinking to some of bonus cards. For example some Explorer bonuses allow you to choose from extra tiles and some from less tiles than normal. Borrowed elements from Puerto Rico don't always work well.

Easy for a loser to damage a potential winner by targetting them.

Plus side is the miniatures are superb and you can collectively affeact the winning conditions on each turn.

Great for getting into medium weight games. It's pretty understandable, there are some interesting things going on with it. There's a bit of rock-paper-scissors, dice rolling, and heaps of thematic goodness. At least on my copy the pieces were junk, but it's definitely a fun game.

RATING: 7
Nice blend of resource management with multiple options to pursue for winning, with a bit of fighting thrown in!  Great pieces.

Down sides are long playing time and weak battle mechanic; I would rate this much higher if the combat system were better.

 House rules:

* Place 2 'battle' tokens per player on the table.  After each action, a player takes one token until they are gone.  When a player attacks another and wins, the attacker takes a battle token from that player.  At the end of the game, the VPs on 'Last Battle Won' are awarded to the player with the most battle tokens.

I know there are lots of people giving this game some low ratings.  I can see why, especially if people are expecting this to be a wargame or are using the regular battle system.  However, I have played this game using 5's & 6's as hits in battle and also have used the charts here on BGG that reduces all the battle rolls down to a single Probability roll.  Those two options really iron out any wrinkles this game has.  I think it really does take the best of Puerto Rico and expands on it for the better.  This game is a perfect bridge b/w wargamers and non-wargamers where both can truely enjoy this game.  I am a wargamer myself and wasn't sure if I would enjoy the game because I knew there wasn't much warring.  However, I was blown away with how much I enjoyed this game.  Lots of risk management and empire building but also has some battles mixed in there with it.  Its a perfect blend.  Give this game a try but understand what you're getting.  You are NOT getting a wargame.

This game is great, as far as I'm concerned, though it hasn't aged well... beautiful to look at, fun to play, and a good amount of strategy.  Only complaint is the amount of luck in the battle sequence... rock paper scissors only works so well when rock costs 1 gold and scissors costs 10.  Just buy a bunch of rocks.  Then hurl them at people that won't play this game because of this relatively minor complaint.  That way everybody wins.

The influence of Puerto Rico is clear.  AoM adds randomness (of which PR has ~very~ little) and private information (of which PR functionally has none).

Sold this one after 3 plays. We just didn't see the excitement of spending half of an already long game rolling a fistful of dice. Not to mention futzing with all the miniatures. Really felt like more trouble than it was worth.

I have the exact same reaction to Age of Mythology as I do with Marvel Heroes: I really want to like this more than I do. There's quite a lot going for the game: The theme is rich, the mechanics (borrowing much from Puerto Rico) are pretty solid and the minis, of course, are way cool. I like that the civilizations are asymmetrical yet balanced, and that the fighting forces have so much depth and variety. And yet, this is where the game breaks down. For all the variety, combat basically comes down to a guessing game for gaining a small edge, followed by die rolls. And the combats are way too clunky and long. Other minor quibbles are that the graphic design is poor in terms of printing unit costs and abilities in places that are actually useful to players and the final-level heroes are overpowered compared to all the other combat units. However, realistically, with a slightly more streamlined and interesting combat system, Age of Mythology probably would have been a runaway hit and would rank much higher in my book. Sadly, like Marvel Heroes, Age of Mythology ends up as a near miss that doesn't quite make the cut of remaining in my collection.

A nicely designed game for one based on a computer game. Good artwork and figures and I like the way that each player has their own gameboard.

The range of options available each turn combined with the various options for victory points gives scope to try differing game strategies each game and I like the way that you can plan your turn but then revise your strategy depending on which random cards you pick up. Good resource management and well-timed strikes are key, although combat tends to be the exception rather than the rule, as it is risky (even for the player with the stronger force) and there are often other pressing needs.

An enjoyable game, although perhaps not a regular.

Upon reading the rules, I knew I would not want to roll all of those dice for combat, so I wrote a program to calculate the exact probability of every combat matchup and created a couple of tables.

‘Age of Mythology’ (‘AoM’) ranks with ‘Axis & Allies’ as the favorite game of the AASGC crew.  When we have it on the docket, we double our usual turn out.  It is an abstract, semi-historical strategy game that offers value to youths of an unusually wide range of age and experience (from elementary to high school – and as club leader, I can attest that it never grows old).  It offers one vitally important benefit to any game coach: its rules are well-organized and clear.  The rules are errata-free and the game needs no modifications.

‘Age of Mythology’, ‘Civilization’ and ‘History of the World’ provide complementary discovery-learning experiences by emphasizing different historical dynamics.  AASGC treats them as a unit, commencing each fall semester with the three in succession. 

AoM is a civilization-building game disguised as a battle of heroes & titans.  Players explore for new land and resources, building value-multiplying resource-processing capacity in villages/cities while preparing defenses in the form of armies of mortals, heroes, and mythic creatures, each with different strengths/weaknesses (‘rock-paper-scissors’).  The game materials present a splendid array of data that successful players must integrate and evaluate; it hits the ‘zone of proximal development’ for a wide range of age-experience levels.  It features masterful minis and associated cards, some of the best in the industry.  The lads love ‘em, and closely study and compare their properties.

The game, moreover, provides a very powerful tool for skills development in situation assessment and forecasting, resource-management, course-of-action development, and insight into the minds of others.  Players can choose alternative defensive vs. offensive strategies (wealth through investment vs. plunder through conquest) – the game, in fact, is a morality play in a box.   Swords-into-ploughshares or vice-versa? – every player must decide.  Patience and prudence usually win over the long haul, but the game tempts lads to squander resources on exciting battles and pay the price down the road – a memorable lesson in the costs of indulgence.  Multi-player diplomacy fosters socially interactive experiential learning, for managing both conflict and cooperation.

AoM provides a captivating evocation of the spirit of ancient myths, legends, and pantheons (Egyptian, Greek, Norse).  Should stimulate interest in epic literature from Gilgamesh, Odysseus and Herakles to Beowulf and Gandalf.

Played this only three times so far and enjoyed it somewhat.  Feels like its missing something though, not much to provoke combat. The miniatures are useless since they are not placed on a map, only to show which units you have bought.  Counters with stats on them would have been much more useful.  I really want to like this game more and maybe with a few house rules I will.  As it is, there is a lot of kingmaking going on.

Yes it has its flaws, but the reviews on BGG are fair.  Yes its a luck system a bit for combat (bluff at best) and yes, its dice based combat, but the underlying mechanisms of building up your civilisation and advancing through ages are enjoyable.

A downside is that the technologies are always available, rather than coming as you progress through ages (eg. Siege engines from the outset).   

But I knew all this before I bought it (except the last part).  As a result I like it and am not disappointed.
I also wanted a deeper, longer civ/wargame for 3P, which is what I got.

Not everyone's cup of tea, but nice for a change...

Also really looking forward to trying it 3P - so far only done 2P and 4P

After becoming familiar with the rules and checking the components and sitting down to play the games, it defenitely looks one of the best design I ever saw and something exactly for my taste. I mean it was puerto Rico with great plastic armys and a nice theme. Unfortunately it proves something that I have learned about games... you cant put all the good things into one packages and make it work. It's just too much. Managing all the armys is way too tiresome for the end result that you get. And the building part is not that good as Puerto Ricos. Still I'd rate it an above average game, something I'd play again.

What's not to like? Bit of Catan, bit of Race for the Galaxy, bit of Nexus Ops. OK it runs quite long but then I'm ok with that and it's easy to shorten by removing a few red cubes. 

I really can't understand the complaints about the combat in this. We used the 'roll 5s or 6s' rule  and had no problem at all - it doesn't take very long and we have no problem with this amount of luck. 

I did loads of research looking for a civ game playable by 2 and apart from Through the Ages this was the only one. Others may question whether it is a civ game but whatever, we love it!

RATING: 7
Lots of neat stuff here, in terms of pieces and in terms of mechanics.  It is, however, a classic example of Eagle Games overreach.  There's at least three pretty interesting games in this box, but they don't work together all that well, making the whole less than the sum of its parts.  Combat is an interesting bluff/counterbluff game, production and trade mechanics are a fancy little basic euro, and the hand management aspect provides another filler-esque maximization game.  Together, though, they aren't cohesive, and they throw off the pacing.  It is surprising, for a game over 10 years old, just how modern this feels.  The warts that are here remind me of a not-quite-polished-enough kickstarter effort.  Still, this is worth playing at least once.  It's unique, and even though the theme doesn't make much sense outside of the video game franchise, it's familiar enough to be pretty successful.

First play - Four players. This may have been 1 too many players. We only had the three decks so two players shared the greek deck. I was Egypt and a fourth player was the Norse. The Norse player was agressive and attacked first and poorly. After a few rounds he was wiped out. We didnt have a strong handle on the rules and many mistakes were caught after several rounds of playing it wrong so after 3 hours we were ready to call it quits. I was allowed to gather up enough cubes to build The Wonder which ended the game. I came in fourth. the player with the largest army took the most victory points. I would like to try this again with 3 players. With a stronger grasp of the rules I think I would raise my rating on this after another play.

It looks like the Age of Mythology, smells like the Age of Mythology, but it sure as hell doesn't play like the Age of Mythology, at least not the PC game, from which it derived its name.

Age of Mythology comes with over three hundred stunning miniatures of mythological heroes and beasts, all of which are completely unnecessary. There's no map, so seemingly there shouldn't be a need for dudes, especially this many of them. Another thing that I find odd is the lack of artwork on the building tiles, considering one of the main objectives of this game is to build the largest city display. Rows of little yellow tiles with HOUSE in big black letters doesn't exactly titillate the senses. The cards are nice, if a bit flimsy, and overall the art is top notch. If nothing else, this game is as big of a home brew toolbox as the old Eagle Games Civilization used to be.

All kidding aside, playing Age of Mythology has been a mixed bag for me. There are many aspects of the game that I find innovative and engaging, such as the use of exploration tiles and player mats to abstract the large, fixed territory map most games in this genre rely on. This cuts down on table sprawl while still allowing for 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) type game play. The threaded turn order keeps everyone involved in the game and the action system adds a very subtle screw your neighbor strategic layer.

Yet other parts of the design feel half baked. The combat system in particular really holds the game back. A battle brings everything to a screeching halt as the players involved have to select a small number of miniatures from their large pool of minions to send into the battle. Combat is then resolved via blind one on one match-ups that are essentially nothing more than rock-paper-scissors. To make matters worse, attacks can (and usually do) end after one or two combats, even if ten creatures were sent to the fight. As a result, there is very little in the way of attrition for either player. Despite being based on a RTS war game, there is little reason to ever fight in any protracted battles.

For the most part, I still like the game. Unfortunately, my issues with the combat system limit the plays it will get. A couple of years ago I would have been more willing to put up with the game's quirks, but today there is so much more competition for my three hours of boardgame time that I have a hard time pulling it out on game day. As a result, this only gets played once a year, at best.

Decent game, but not all it's billed to be, or that I'd hoped for. I think it would be outstanding if: it took at most 2 hours, there were more (and more differentiated) buildings, the combat system was scrapped and rebuilt, there were better and more angst-filled tradeoffs in the cardplay, and....  Hmm, I think I'm looking for a rather different game than this mediocre one.

As usual for Eagle games, great components for the money.  I like this game and the only thing holding it back for me  is a slow and plodding combat system that can be downright painful for the other players to sit through.

RATING: 7
3 distinct civilisations (greek, norse, and egyptian) vie for victory points in a game of trade conquest and expansion, game play from 2 decks of cards,  each turn each player makes 3 actions, but has a choice of 8 or so, however  you can use limited actions you hvae all the time or risk takeing a chance on random cards, random cards are always better but as you have alimited hand size (which can improve by advancement) you may not get what you need, all players draw from a limited pool of resources (renewed by spending) to purchase  units for fighting and buildings to  help production (or in a very small way buy victory points, again of which there are a limited number), designed for 3 players but  with an expansion supports up to 6 (though without expasnion there are only enough  resource cubes to allow 4 players to play form teh box, though 6 sets of units are included, hmm, all in all i enjoy this but teher are things i enjoy more so.

Able to take up to 6 players.
Players control armies made up of warriors, priests, heroes, and mythical creatures from ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. They gather resources, which allow them to create buildings and armies. Special buildings are required to allow players to build new army types and improve the abilities of their units.

Played this before AOE III and I must say I had some fun playing it.  

We played with the "out of the box" combat rules.  It was quite a lot of dice rolling and units didn't really seem distinguished.

With 3 players it's definitely hard to recover from a bad combat.  And it almost seemed impossible to get the wonder in our game because of the lack of resources.  Looks like it requires a bit of balance unlike the combat system.

This game is more or less a mish-mosh of mechanics that almost mold together well.

Want to try again with the more preferred combat system and a better idea of the rules.

Don't let the randomness and chaos of this wargame (there can be *a lot*) fool you.  You can control it by knowing when to let it occur and when not to.  Good player see this and win often. Bad ones see the game as a luck-fest and win randomly. 

As for the combat down time, the answer is the same one as in Titan: With experience you learn to negotiate the combats (and here you can flee without any troops being lost). Of course there are times where you want the fun of playing it out.

Lastly, I must admit that the game does have an early attack problem (the reward is too high for an even chance action).  So house rule is needed to discourage this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are alot of things I enjoy about this game, but it always feels like the game takes longer than it should and units seem to pile up in a mass escalation. I think the game would probably run smoother with greater incentive to attack more frequently, to keep players from ending up with an overflowing board of units. Still, I enjoy the civilization-style development and unique flavor of the different factions.

Anybody imaginative could have fun with this game's units, despite the game's rules.  This game offers a lot, but plays very slowly, due to players' decisions having to be made on the fly.  Unfortunately, it is extremely unforgiving of mistakes, which can send your potential for victory plummeting.  Though my distaste for dice-throwing battle resolution biases me, I have attempted to filter that bias from my scoring of the game.  The game duration, however, really sucks a lot of joy out of the game.  Though the game has a clever victory point bank which serves to limit the number of turns in the game, the turns take an eternity or two.  Lucky draws of [i]Gather All[/i] cards for the same player means another player can go without resources for several turns consecutively.  Although the units are beautiful, they really serve no purpose other than to look cool, and pull you into the theme:  For battle, you have to refer to their cards anyway in order to determine their traits, so like [thing=2542]Gargon[/thing], I would have no problem just using the cards.  I adore, however, bumping the kitty on the different victory point prizes.

AoM is a nice adaption.  The board captures area control without a map.  The combat system is the weak area in the game as it's essentially glorified Rock / Paper / Scissors.  Still, it has a nice bluff element to it which tickles me a little bit.

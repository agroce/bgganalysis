Brilliant! It feels like you are in a Zombie B-Movie, a cult classic.  I hope they come up with expansions where you end up in a new city, like The Walking Dead. This franchise has some serious potential and longevity!

Need to spend more time with this. Thoroughly enjoyed 2/3 plays I had but it has been shelved for a while like Nemo's War. Both games are great just a severe time commitment I don't have at the minute. Re-watched Ricky Royal's play through and it looks fantastic still.

Feels much more like an adventure game than a war game (I was expected a wargame). You ultimately play a town's leadership with varying abilities and roles  trying to solve the problem of the advancing hordes of zombies. While I understand what they were attempting with the rulebooks, they are the games biggest hindrance. Once you can get past that, this is a VERY well designed game, though a little heavy.

A lot of fun!  Many turns end up being very tense, and you have a lot of decisions to make.  Game gets increasingly tense towards then end, which gives the right 'feel' for the game.

RATING: 9
My comments to Dawn of the Zeds will largely be a comparison to another States of Siege game I enjoy: Cruel Necessity. Both games are solid experiences. I do think Dawn of the Zeds would be a blast to play cooperatively (though I haven't tried yet). 

There's tons of game in this box. The zombie theme, I find, is not as compelling as Cruel Necessity's historical theme. However, as opposed to the somewhat tenuous marriage of theme and game play in Cruel Necessity, Dawn of the Zed's thematic flavor drips off every aspect of game play. The collection of game mechanisms in Dawn of the Zed's also seems more engaging than Cruel Necessity. The engagement comes from the many aspects you can add to an individual game, the shear number of cards that form the game's narrative, and the variation in the playable heroes. This is a game that you could consistently play every night for awhile and not get bored in the least. The rule book also does a good job of teaching you the game. 

The rule book's excellence as a teaching tool has a consequence, though. The rule book is not very good as a rule reference. The rules are spread out among different books and, even if you have found the correct book, you will likely have to look at numerous sections of the book to locate a particular rule, depending on which difficulty you are playing. So, unlike Cruel Necessity where you could put it on the shelf for a few months and then immediately play it without rule issues, Dawn of the Zeds is likely to be a game that, once left idle, would be more frustrating take off the shelf and play.

If I ignore my preference for Cruel Necessity's theme, I believe Dawn of the Zeds to be a superior game. However, a single campaign of Cruel Necessity has stuck with me more than any of my plays of Dawn of the Zeds. 

Edit, Sept 2017: Cruel Necessity is still probably my favorite pure States of Siege experience, but this game has a special quality above and beyond States of Siege games, which was solidified after I played Nemo's War.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite solo games. Super tough and interesting decisions to make. Lots of replay value. You need to adjust your strategy depending on which heroes, heroic civilians and Event/Fate cards you draw. There is a lot of dice rolling involved in this game but your odds of succeeding at these are very clear and the more you play the better you can estimate your chances in every given situation. If you are looking for a challenging and strategic solitaire experience with great theme and you like the zombie setting then I can highly recommend this game!

One of the best zombie games ever made. It wonderfully blends the campy hilarity of old zombie flicks with the feeling of desperation and impending dread of the horror genre, all held together with solid mechanics that feel intuitive and realistic. It is not for the faint-hearted, though: a heavy rule set and steep learning curve will be a turn off for many.

I loved the second edition, and despite the increase in rules complexity (and the three rulebooks!), VPG did a good job at incrementally presenting each batch of new rules in an easy-to-follow format. I was able to teach the game to a newbie at about the same level of the DoZ2 "Classic" level with no problem. 

I'm also happy that the 2-player game works really well! Alternating personal actions while sharing others might feel to some like you're just playing a solitaire game with two people, but my husband and I thought it was fine, and I enjoyed myself immensely.

The game looks good and the theme has been well integrated with the game mechanics... but as a solitaire game, I just find it way too hard. And as a cooperative game, the way things works feels like it's been kind of forced into what truly should be a pure solitaire game, since no one's got anything that is "theirs", so to speak; the character you choose is not yours to play, the action marker that you have can be spent on making anyone do anything, and there's no secret information or anything like that to keep for yourself - that YOU need to carefully consider how to use. The only good thing about playing DotZ with your friends is that you have someone to share all the anxiety with (it's almost ridiculously challenging). All in all I'm a bit disappointed and quite sad about how this experience turned out for me, because I was certain that this would be one of my top 3 solitaire games. Instead, I ended up selling it after 6 plays (4 solitaire, 2 with friends), because that was all the anxiety I could take. The more I played, the less fun I had :/

I've been a fan of the Zeds since the first edition, and this wonderful reissue has taken the game to a whole new level. The game is easy to play, has a few rule kinks etc, but nothing that can't be learned in a session or two. The well thought out asymmetry of the various heroes, the variability and variety of the events and fate cards, the rolls of the dice, all of these rive an overall immersive, highly tactical, tense and satisfying experience. The replayability of the game is through the roof, and like all good coop/solos, the game feels punishing and impossible to beat, until you start realizing the technical and tactical nuances that can give you an edge. The best Stage of Siege game by far, and a wonderful coop or solo (or vs?) experience. Highly recommended.

+ Exceptionally well thought out asymmetric powers and variability
+ Interwoven simple mechanisms that work well together
+ Large scope to get much better at the game, and gain an edge over the randomness
+ Superbly balanced
+ Works extermely well solo as well as coop
+ Small footprint
+ Gorgeous components and art

= Lots of luck involved
= Long, epic sessions can take 5-6 hours
= Tough to beat

- The rulebook is organized by game level, instead of for reference. Arguably this was a mistake. Nothing that can't be solved though
- Needs printed player aids

OMG!! Where to begin. Great thematic game. You really feel like the apocalyptic zombies are coming to your town and you have to defend it. There are endless decisions to make from the make up of your team to where you send people to best use their abilities. Takes a little effort to learn the game but once you do it is great!!! One of my favorites. Gets on the table more than most games.

This may be the only tactical zombie game in existence, so if that is your thing, you may like it. As with other VPG States of Siege games, you have to defend a single point on the map--in this case, the town of Farmingdale--against attacks from multiple positions. If zombies happen to make it to the town itself, you lose. VPG took the SOS engine and reskinned it for zombies. 

The problem is that having the enemies move toward a central point works well in a wargame, but for zombies, it's thematically contradictory. Zombies simply aren't that focused, and that, for me, breaks the suspension of disbelief. Now if the town of Farmingdale were already overrun by zombies, and you had to fix the problem--that makes more sense. 

In general, I found the theme to be lacking. This is a game with demanding mechanics, and that does not make for a thematic experience, as much as we gamers may imagine that pie in the sky that flawlessly blends mechanical and thematic games. The zombies, they're just generic enemies, really, and your goal is to fight them off. The cards try to embellish theme, but theme is something that needs to intersect with the rules; otherwise, it's nothing more than a wall covering.

Another thing I won't fail to mention is that the rules are overwrought. They're spread among--count them--six different rulebooks, creating the overwhelming impression that the game is far more complex than it really is. This is certainly the strangest presentation of rules I've ever seen for a board game, and VPG clearly ignored the adage that less is more. 

It's not a bad game, and if you prefer tactical to thematic games, you may even dig it. For me--I lean heavily toward Ameritrash games--it disappoints more than any game I've played in recent memory.

RATING: 9.5
When talking about this game, I can’t help but compare it to Eldritch Horror because I find them so similar in what they try to accomplish. And this game has superseded Eldritch Horror for me as my thematic, dice chucker of choice. I’m not getting rid of EH as it covers a different theme, but I do think this one is superior to it in terms of design. 

That’s because you have much more player agency in Zeds by virtue of more dice-less actions. The dice-less actions in EH are pretty much to move one space or take a ticket. Here you can move several spaces or build a barricade or use some special character action. And if you do pick up the dice and fail, someone else can give you their action to roll again. That is, anyone can use their individual player action on anyone else. Need that guy to keep shooting? You can do that. The result of all this is more player agency and more table discussion about who should do what. 

Thematically speaking, the cards hold the game together in terms of funny/dreadful events as well as hope-full and hope-less swings of fortune. We’ve thought we were dead only to have “A Hero Arrives!” flip over and suddenly we’re right back in it.  We’ve been cruising only to have “You Gotta Be Kidding Me …” flip over. The Fate cards are especially well designed in that they’re a mix of good and bad things that feels very well balanced after three plays. Kudos to the testing team.

Overall, I find this game more enjoyable than EH. I still enjoy EH but there’s so much luck built into the design that some games are too easy, some are brutal, and only some are down to the wire the way you want a game to be. The best thing I can say about DotZ is that I wish EH would copy this design and give players more to think about and do.

I've yet to play solitaire and don't know that I ever will simply because my friends and I are enjoying it so much as a coop game. We play the standard/short coop game and it’s a pretty reliable 4 hours, so it’s not short.

On the negative side, I know a lot of effort went into the multiple rulebooks but the more I play the game, the more frustrated I am with them. I’ve found the rules harder than it should be to coalesce into my head and it’s simply because the rules are scattered about in different places. The so-called Comprehensive Rulebook makes the same error. None of the rules are difficult, there are just so many of them and they're organized in a learn-to-play order without a comprehensive reference once you have learned to play.

For example, there’s no one place for the Stacking rules; you have to look here for humans, here for zeds, and there for the tunnels. When you chop up the rules like that, it makes it harder to organize the rules mentally and find rules as you’re playing. Fortunately, BGGers have stepped in to make a comprehensive set.

After 11 games and just about to start with the level 4 of difficulty (there are 5 difficulty levels) I must say that this game is just great. Epic. All in it is thematic and all in it is an unique experience. I've played only in solitary mode for now. If you play in solitary then you must buy this game. Also I love the manuals of the game. It makes me read it when I don't want to play to learn more about the characters and enemies.

Ok, that's a tricky one.
On the plus side : 
The rules, compare to the V2 are better. More streamlined. Simpler to learn, to implement, to teach. but the essence of the game is still there. I have yet to try the coop and vs. modes.

On the minus side :
The overall quality of the materials is just poor. After 4 plays the board glued to the base is already peeling on one corner. The tokens are thin, and light. Thinner and lighter than your usual euro token (I am not comparing to VPG's trademark laser cuts).
The art also has been tuned down, most probably to appeal to a broader audience.

The gameplay stil puts DotZ at the top with the best of the bests. But the production is just mehhh (not to say worse)

This score is based upon a 4 player co-op at just level 1 although the score may be higher for a solo play. It is very difficult and with character elimination, players will gradually end up getting minor roles after their character dies. It takes a long time to play and can take a further hour to end when it's clear that a win is not going to happen. too much emphasis on luck, one bad roll could kill your character, The most positive aspect of this game is it's the most "realistic" zombie game I've played as the zombies are very tough... too tough.

[Played 51 times]

It has lot of randomness (dice and cards, both ranging from "very helpful" to "very harmful"), but surprisingly it also offers a lot of tactical and strategical decisions and creates a believable cinematic narrative arc.

High replay value (due to the aforementioned variance and because you use only a fraction of the available characters, events, enemies, plot twists, etc. per game).

The multiple rulebooks ease the learning of the system and are full of useful cross references. It is not as complicated as five (!) rulebooks would lead you to believe at first.

The various difficulty levels and several variant rules let you customize the experience to your liking.

Nice artwork and sturdy components.

Played the co-op basic game on the fly.  There's a lot of meat to chew on this game due to all the different ways to play, six rule books, many counters and cards - not all of which are applicable to the game you're playing.  Still, this may be the quintessential zombie survival game. More plays will tell.  

Update: I played two solitaire games, Basic then Level II - Apocolypse!, and I'm having a blast. At first I was daunted by all the rulebooks but the organization all makes sense and is a lot easier to get into than what first appears.

RATING: 9
The definitive Dawn of the Zeds experience. Makes some subtle, but very meaningful, changes to the rules. Between that and the improved components, this really brings the game up to a whole new level of greatness. If you've played the previous version, you can jump in pretty easily with a couple of rules references. I found the index section of the rule books to be very useful for this. Speaking of the rule books, it is a little odd that there are 5 separate rule books here, but I think they tried to make this as teachable as possible, even though they didn't do much to streamline the rules at all. If I hadn't played the second edition, I probably would have been overwhelmed by all the rules and various ways to play. This is a much simpler game than the rules would let on, but worth it if you can get through them. This edition of Dawn of the Zeds very well could be my favorite solo game. It includes cooperative and versus modes, but this is most definitely a solo game at its heart.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] Really amazing first play - ordered the cardboard version even before the session was over!  AND that was just the Basic Game (one of SIX increasing difficulty levels which add complexity and depth).  The varied heroes and their nuanced abilities presented some real tactical decisions and watching the narrative unfold via the die results and the Event/Fate draws was VERY entertaining.  Dramatic throughout, I am impressed and can't wait to play more.  UPDATE: After 5 games at the Walking Zeds! level in just 7 days I am ecstatic with the game system, the characters, the emerging narrative, and the challenging gameplay - finally even won one!

This game is hard and unforgiving. Even on Level 1 (the easiest after the tutorial) you are thrown into the deep end.

Never really felt that we got on top of things with the game and were constantly on the back foot. Unlike X-Com (which had a similar feel) we were quickly overwhelmed with no way to redress the balance.

When playing with 4 players and each with a single character, the elimination of that character leaves the player with little else to do for the rest of the game in a game as long as this.

I have played this many times solitaire, twice co-op, and I love it.  The game is oozing with theme and the struggle to survive the zombie onslaught is very intense, even on the lower levels.  If you find the game too hard you can adjust the difficulty level.

The game offers simplified rules all the way to some fairly heavy game-play.  At first I only tried the basic and level 1 rules, because even that was quite a bit to digest for a first game.  Now I've added all the rules and I'm happy to say they add more strategic depth as well as Chrome/Narrative.

There is co-op play which I tried once with 4 players and once with 2.  All of the information is open and most resources are shared.  There is very little difference as to how the game works between solitaire and co-op.

The game also offers versus play, but I haven't even looked at the rules for that.

The one thing that drives me nuts about the game is the LUCK factor - the key actions and many character abilities rely on dice rolls.  You could spend an action and accomplish nothing: no supplies gathered, no damage to the enemy, a special ability doesn't work, research isn't successful and so on.  These all or nothing results can be a real game breaker if you have a series of bad rolls.  I am thinking of developing a variant to help limit the luck factor, but, I'm not sure it's necessary.  There is one character who greatly takes the luck out of the game if you use him and certain characters don't rely on luck for their key abilities.  So, I'm really concerned the LUCK factor is a little too much for me, but I'm on the fence still as to whether I can live with it.

Encore une bonne surprise pour la fin d'année 2016!
Dawn of the Zeds nous plonge directement dans son thème qui est très bien retranscrit avant même de débuter la partie.
Le jeu n'est pas traduit mais cela n'est pas gênant une fois que l'on a compris le principe général. Soit dit en passant, je n'ai pas épluché les règles, ça par contre c'est surement une autre histoire ^^
Ce qui peut être parfois gênant dans les jeux de coopération, c'est ce que l'on appelle plus communément l'effet "leader". Chaque jeu de coopération essaye avec plus ou moins de succès de contourner celui-ci. Dans notre cas le pari est plutôt réussi avec la mise en place de points d'actions personnels et communs.
Il va falloir optimiser et s'armer de patience pour venir à bouts des différentes configurations proposées par le jeu. Certaines parties peuvent s'avérer être très longues et du coup plus difficile d'y survivre ...
La présence de cartes d'évènement apporte son lot de piquant au jeu. Il va donc pas falloir être uniquement bons aux dés, il va falloir être aussi bon au tirage pour éviter de choper les mauvaises cartes regroupées (ce qui a été notre cas pour l'initiation :p)
J'aurai bien mis un 9/10 pour ce jeu tellement il m'a plu de par sa richesse et son thème. Le problème c'est que pour sortir ce jeu, cela va demander de la patience pour mettre en place la partie et aussi programmer quelques heures de jeu qui me paraissent difficilement maitrisées. Ce n'est pas un point noir mais c'est juste que ça me gène car ça m'empêcherai d'y jouer aussi souvent que je le souhaiterai ... parce que oui, j'ai toujours envie d'y revenir ! :-)

This game comes with 6 books (Inculding rules, setup, information, small plot, ...), this means the game has high replayable value.
The gameplay is kinda like tower defense and the brightest thing about the gameplay is everyone is doing this together so you don't have to wait for turn.

This game feels extremely balanced and highly polished.  You have all the chits and card flipping of a Fantasy Flight game, but surprisingly you have one of the best rule books I've read (for a relatively complex Ameritrash game).  The art is gorgeous and gives off a "grindhouse" cinema vibe.  Bravo to VPG's for putting together a refined solo gaming experience.

One of those games you really like and there's a lot there to chew on (no pun intended), but because of its set-up time, complexity, and length it's hard to get to the table. Very difficult to beat and very tense - so it really captures the sense of overwhelming dread and panic that a zombie game should exude.

Named the ultimate state-of-siege game and called out for its cineastic experience, I had to get it. And well, it is good for solo play and the new edition even adds a one-vs-all mode. First play was great already, love it! Setup time makes it hard to get this to the table, though.

RATING: N/A
[thing=175095][/thing] is a tower defense game (in this case, a city) in which the players are heroes, trying to prevent the hordes of zombies to reach the town center. The heroes have the help of militias in this endeavor, and, couple with battling the undead, is necessary to forage for ammo and food, to be careful with the spread of the disease and many other concerns.

[thing=175095]Dawn of the Zeds[/thing] is mainly a solo game, based in scenarios, and it follows a procedure I enjoy: teaching the game little by little, only requiring what is necessary for the scenario at hand - something done in Earth Reborn and others. Thus, learning the game is a lot easier and more natural - at first, only the basics of hand to hand combat, gunfire, movement and forage are required, for instance.

[thing=175095]Dawn of the Zeds[/thing] has a wargame feeling, as it uses a similar mode of mechanics already used in games that depict real battles. Therefore, [thing=175095]Dawn of the Zeds[/thing] have different types of combat, use of terrain for defense, rules for retreat, tables for fight resolution, and so on.

The set up for the scenarios isn't all that hard (when compared with other heavy solo games) - just positioning units, tokens and setting up the decks (Fate and Events). Playing time varies from scenarios, but none is truly short, going on around 90+ minutes. Difficulty is quite high, even in the basic scenario - some of it due to luck, since the mechanism has dice rolls for attacks (in both types), for survival, forage and other situations. Constantly rolling high can make even the most dire scenario a whole lot easier.

Replay value could be a problem, when talking about scenarios, yet the game provides several random elements (order of events, many types of heroes and militia, even different endings) that can change the pressure points, necessities and choices. The production value is quite nice - the art is really well done, there are a bunch of well organized manuals and the tokens are neat (though some are small).

Overall, [thing=175095]Dawn of the Zeds[/thing] presents a quite thematic experience, with a high level of challenge, good amount of decision-making and many moments for cheer. It can bother players that want more control over the result of their actions, since luck is heavly present, but good positioning, use of terrain and abilities can make odds favor the player. Not a perfect game - it runs a little too long for my tastes -, but one with several strong points and definitely worth of having and playing. Recommended.

Man, this is a lot of work for a tower defense game. I'm not sure I'll ever make it to all the crazy rules. I won, but it wasn't that enjoyable. I doubt more complexity will change that, but maybe I'll get around to trying more. Maybe not.

Supported on kickstarter and purchased primarily as a co-op but even solo,  the game play is solid and tense and keeps you in throughout.

Zeds really captures that sinking dread and creepy feeling manifested in a shambling death horde of zombies heading in your direction.  This is the best zombie themed game I have played.  Pickles saved my skin!

Alternate ending:

More than any other zombie game Zeds provides that ever present pit of the stomach dread with every flip of a Fate card followed by a jolt of adrenalin as I push back or attempt to avoid the ever forming wave of zombies shuffling towards the center of the board.

Jumping in relatively eager into a good-looking zombie(not a zombie fan) co-op that was 90 minutes long. Turns out it was more like 210 minutes with 4 players and I didn't really see us APing at all, maybe 30 minutes max off from gametime. There was still 90-120 minutes too much in any case. It might work as a solo game.
The game felt very pandemic like but pandemic takes the victory any day in every category except flavor. It also mostly boils down to the die rolls as even if you can mitigate some luck the dice are in control. I did have a bit of fun the first hours but I think I've seen enough of this game to last a lifetime.

Have only played up to Level 2 so far. Really enjoyable. Most games take it down to the wire with maybe 2 or 3 cards remaining before you (most of the time) lose. So far I've enjoyed every game even when losing badly as sometimes you can almost scrape through a victory. Almost.

Not sure what to make of this yet after 0.5 play on Basic and 1 play on Outbreak.

Thoughts : 
I played with 2.
The theme might translate better with more players playing more of the heroes, since people will become personally invested in one person and their safety instead of the feeling of managing a team.

Pressure was light with two advanced gamers playing Outbreak.  Higher level cards should add more challenge, and chaos zones may add some thematic challenge as well.

There are a lot of rules and special cases to manage, but each rule is fairly simple to apply.  I'm not usually one for demos, but I think you'd learn faster and enjoy this game more by playing with expert players on one of the higher level scenarios.  For serious gamers the challenge is a little flat on the early levels but there's a lot to keep track of and learn about the system.

Pretty much a solo-only game.  While it attempts to play with more than one player, it is really just "pass the decision" around the table -- absolutely no imagination went into making it a decent multi-player co-op.

After 4 plays i can definitely say this is a big improvement over the 2nd editions. A-Z Rulebook is excellent and i find almost anything i need in there. There is still a considerable amount of rules, and it's fiddly but less so than the 2nd edition. And it's worth the experience.

It's a difficult game which can get frustrating because it does take a few minutes to setup. Also it can a bit on the lengthy side. When things are not going your way this can feel even longer. 

I have only played it solo coop and i can't see any reason to play it the old solo mode. One of my favourite solo games. I will try and play it with another player and see how it plays as a coop.

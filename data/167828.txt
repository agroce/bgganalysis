GAME: Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age with Mediterranean Expansion
RANK: 3891
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
+ Expanding on the Bronze Age in a huge way; this game is much more enjoyable than the original because you are given more choices.
- I'm already wishing for another expansion with more developments to research to further broaden the strategic options.

Furcsa, hogy külön játékként van fenn, pusztán amiatt, hogy a kieget is betették a dobozba (na jó, jegyzettömbből is kettő van, külön az alaphoz és külön a kieges változathoz). Értelemszerűen ugyanazt a pontot kapta így is... Bár elismerem, hogy más a szép fa mediterrániumon játszani, mint a papír házi változaton volt. De azért az fura, hogy túl közel vannak a lyukak egymáshoz, a pálcák alig férnek el egymástól:)
--- 
Az eddigi RTTA-k így együtt már elég változatosak, attól függően váltogathatjuk, hogy mennyire nehéz partit szeretnénk. A bronz még kieggel is kicsit egyhangú volt, amikor 10-et játszottam egy nap alatt, így hogy ennyi féle van, már oké a dolog:)
BGG szerint a nehézségek:
bronz alap 1,8
bronz kieg 1,8
iron alap 2,2
Mediterran kieg 3,0
Érdekes hogy ez a doboz, amiben a Mediterran is meg az iron alap is egyben benne van, csak 2,0 nehézségen áll.

Ugh - overlong, overwrought, painful downtime, tedious. Also surprisingly hard to understand from the rules, for a relatively simple game - not sure what went wrong there, if it's just the overall clunkiness of the game that makes it hard to understand, or if the rules could be better, but I think it's just the inelegance of the game itself. Everything I don't like about Roll Through the Ages with few of the previous game's features. Just get Ciub, Tom's excellent remake of To Crown a King, or Roll for the Galaxy. Mediterranean expansion just makes it longer and more annoying.

This game is great fun if you're in the right mood for it, but I honestly wonder why it's considered multiplayer.  Without the Mediterranean add-on, there is zero interactivity with anyone else at the table.  The dice could have been made smaller and offered in more numbers to allow people to play out their turns simultaneously.  While yes, you need to know who is getting close to triggering the end-game, it ultimately is the epitome of multiplayer solitaire and you just compare points at the end of the game.

That being said, this game can serve its purpose well by being portable.  You don't really need to carry around the whole box - just a couple of sheets, some pegs, and the pegboards themselves.  Nice lunch-time-style kinda game.

Needlessly complicates a fine basic game system. I prefer the Bronze Age version.

Seems to add more decisions without losing the charm of the original. Have not used the Mediterranean expansion yet.

Rating lowered to 7 because it still feels very luck based after more plays, although I have still not played with the Mediterranean expansion.

Moving from the bronze age and into the iron age, one finds a different yet similar experience of dice rolling and civilization building. So far I like this one better, mostly for the simpler resource collection and inclusion of warfare. Also has bigger score sheets, which is nice, The Mediterranean expansion is included in the box; I haven't tried it yet, but it looks interesting.

Surprise from Sam, 10/17/14. This is something that I think will see a lot of play with us. They took some of the ideas, refined them, and added some new ones. It's familiar but different enough to be worth playing even if you have the first one (and the PnP expansion score sheet). 

For instance, in the first one, if you have 8 goods, it's somewhat tedious to move a peg, move up a row, move a peg, move up a row, move a peg... eight times. Here the goods are tracked on one row. The turn itself is slightly longer, since there are new things going on, but it feels like new directions and strategies to explore. 

The dice have somewhat varying quality in the printing, but in general the quality of the components is good.

I generally don't pay attention to Kickstarters; if I had seen the one for Iron Age, I might have been tempted to get it. It is a solid choice for us.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is definitely a bit more going on in this version of the game which I'm uncertain as yet if it makes the game better. The simplicity of the earlier game has its charm and I'm not sure a bit more complexity improves the game as downtime is increased.

(2 plays)  Feels like there are a lot more choices this time around, and it's less clear which of the very different paths to take are best.  Primarily the battles, conquests, and tribute are the biggest game changer.  For us, those are half the points.  The Med expansion is fun, but it would have been nice if the colonies provided effects each turn, rather than one time only.

I liked that ports and provinces were different than settlements from The Bronze Age.  Overall, the better choice between the two versions.

RATING: 7.9
Plays very similar to its predecessor bronze age.  However, there are more options some of these are good and some I still need to delve into.  Solo plays a little different as you can not re-roll skull unlike the solo version of bronze age.  Good quick dice rolling civ game that is an enjoyable solo experience.  I have not play the med expansion yet to this has potential to increase.

RATING: 7
a different game from RttA:tLBA but feels similar.  Both are very good and have different strategies within roughly the same framework.

I fear that military is overpowered.  It's probably fixable by saying that barbarian combat triggered by skulls does not gain you VP.

Az előd kockajátékának tovább bonyolítása a vaskor, ehhez még további bonyolítást tesz hozzá a mediterrán kiegészítő. Annyira a bronzkortól se voltam elájulva, ez a sok lehetőség ellenére talán még annyira sem tetszett. Rengeteg lehetőség egy kockapókerben nekem már sok volt. Persze, aki az ilyen típusú játékot szereti az megtalálhatja a számítását és rengeteg fajta taktikát lehetővé tesz így már a játék. A komponensek kiválóak, de az ára akkor is túlzó véleményem szerint.

My rating as a solo game. Gloriously, wondrously over-produced. What could have been a print & play game (and just as fun) instead is done in fine wood with enough score sheets to get you through the next apocalypse. I love throwing dice and I love Thomas Lehmann dice games. 

I have only played this solo, but I would think having the Mediterranean board would make this pretty interesting with more players. (It works well in solo, as you roll for a bot to block your colonies).

Nice additions, but makes the game a fair bit longer than the original without a huge amount of extra fun.  Sure there are more routes to choose from and some interesting strategic options, but this still runs  longer than the 30 mins advertised and it just isn't that sort of game.  One of the main reasons for this is that it's a little harder to get more dice which means your engine builds slower.

Great game!  We will use the map expansion every time as well.  I'm surprised it wasn't included with the base game as I feel it is essential to truly differentiate this game from the original game.  It was amazing how Matt Leacock was able to make a civilization game without a map in the original game, but come on(!) you know you wanted one.  Tom Lehmann did a terrific job building on the original system. The balance between the map and new developments seems spot on.  There are many ways to victory to explore.  This game has everything I would want in a civilization game and plays in about an hour.  Wow!

A number of paths toward victory, diverse options, interesting choices, but absolutely nothing to do when it's not your turn. This begs to be a simultaneous play game….

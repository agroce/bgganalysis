Crazy little drafting luckfest game.  The primary strategy is to roll high.  But the most important strategy is don't give a shit and have fun!

Fun roll and move race game. Players draft their racers at the start, each racer having some kind of special power. The concept is simple, but it's fun with a group.

5-25-13 My group of 8 guys looked at the box and someone asked "does the box say this is a girls' game?" - we then played it, and they immediately all asked for a 2nd round! We loved the zany interactions, and will definitely be playing this some more. Man I wish someone would re-do this one with better components!

RATING: 6.5
Only played once so far.  The character powers and their interactions are what this game is all about, and it's quite fun for the most part. One of our rounds saw me with the Demon, who reduces other peoples' die rolls by one, and everyone else with mostly ineffective characters.  That round was pretty nasty and I ended up not using my power to not ruin the night.  I think it mostly happened due to our inexperience though.

Great little roll-and-move game for 4-5 players. I can see it working well for kids. Only issue is that the stands suck. 2015 UPDATE: Decided to keep this based on a video review as it looks fun, easy, quick, and something that I can share with my son in the near future.

RATING: 5
Mechanically, this isn't really a very good game. It's nowhere near balanced and it's at best just okay. But the experience can at times be amusing. If the players up for some mindless luck filled hilarity it can be a good pastime. But it's really not much of a game.

A very fun lightweight game which can be taught to anyone.  Plays fast and random.  Has some cute and workable components (but also has a pretty bland race-auction board).  I always have a great time when I bring it out.

RATING: 6
The game itself is actually pretty awful and is almost entirely luck driven. The artwork in the copy I played with just horrible as well. With the right group of people that understand that you're really just watching a bunch of broken powers move around based on die rolls, it actually ends up being incredibly amusing.

RATING: 8
Roll-and-move never looked so good!  This game takes the most ridiculously mundane mechanism (a race game where high roller wins) and then throws on the most hilarious combination of modifiers that make it absolutely delightful to play.  When I explain how the races will work players will often look at me with reluctance as if to say "you've got to be kidding me!"  But once they see the special abilities of the characters suddenly things start to click.

The combo of abilities takes this game to the next level of fun.  Just as a few examples:  The Ninja can "shadow" another character and move with them.  The Philosopher can veto the use of any character's special ability.  The Druid can move a space whenever a player uses their special ability.  So if you had these 3 in one race the Ninja could try to shadow the Philosopher, then the Philosopher would cancel his ability thereby allowing the Druid to move a space!  It's these kind of silly interactions of the character abilities that make this game shine.  The roll-and-move may still make the game fairly luck-based, but the die gives you lots of excitement as a character races for the finish line.

(KIDS) Roll and move at its best.  My kids and wife and I all really liked the drafting of athletes for the races and then the interaction between the characters as we rolled and ran for the end.

RATING: 7.5
I have heard this described as the best roll-and-move game ever, and I can understand my people might say that. The selection of athletes and the interaction of powers makes for a lot of fun (at least the first time you play it). Very light though.

Cool concept, but there just isn't enough choices in the game.  Would of been cooler if there were different dice, with different values like Formula D... or something to that affect.  As it is, its just a more complex version of Candyland.

Magical Athlete is fun distilled down to it's essence in boardgame form.  This is my gaming barometer.  If I whip this out and the person turns up their nose...you're OUT.  If you laugh and say, "let's play"...we're probably on the same page boardgame wise.

A new favorite filler. Yeah, it's almost entirely luck based, but that never matters to anyone -- games are always intense, and everyone gets really into it! There is just the tiniest smidgen of strategy involved in the drafting and in choosing your Magical Athlete for each race, but that's really just bait to get you to bite on the racing portion of the game. Incredibly simple, and just plain funfunfun! Rating could go up even higher if I'm still this excited about the game after a few more plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
A fast but lack-luster and luck-filled race game.  Aside from the auctions for athletes and the decision of whether or not to use your special power, this is essentially a roll-and-move game with very little strategy.  There is a bit of psychology and guessing because everyone (except the Spy) blindly picks which athlete to play in each race (obviously it helps if you can remember the magical powers of the athletes that your opponents won at the auction).  The game seems to have a last player disadvantage since this person gets stuck with the last athlete (the one that nobody wanted to pay for) and must roll last in the 1st race.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I never thought I'd say this about a game called "Magical Athlete", but this game is pretty darn good. The components aren't good, and the board art is horrible. The general mechanic of roll and move is awful, but somehow the game overall is really fun, silly, zany, and seriously enjoyable. And I'm playing with full grown adults, not kids!

Es un filler de carreras de personajes. El juego tiene dos fases. Una fase de subastas, en la que se van desvelando personajes en orden y van bajando de valor, hasta que alguien se adjudica. La fase continua hasta que todos tienen el número de personajes adecuado. 
La segunda fase es la fase de carreras, en la que cada jugador utiliza uno de sus personajes y compite en un circuito tipo oca por llegar el primero.
La gracia está en las características propias de cada personaje. Es un juego muy sencillito y rápido. No es gran cosa, aunque para pasar un ratín, vale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial rating a 7.

I quite like the different abilities and the vast range of powers, but a lot of it really comes down to how lucky you are in the ordering of the initial tiles to get a good power, and whether you're lucky enough not to be assassinated at the start.

The races themselves are all pretty mechanical with very little to no real decisions to make.  You could probably input all of the characters into a computer and simulate a race pretty accurately without any player involvement.

So, it's not really much of a game, but is entertaining I guess.   Perhaps.

Wow, I just talked myself out of this game in my own rating.   So rating reduced to a 6... from the 7 it was 45 seconds ago.

If some one were to tell me, "Hey, I have this racing game where all you do is roll a d6 on your turn to see how far you move, but what really makes it awesome is that all the characters have special abilities!", I would think they were smoking crack.  Perhaps it's even true the designers were on something when they designed this game, but it somehow manages to be a very entertaining race game!

Now, if you're looking for a strategic race game, move along, but if you don't mind a wacky quick race game, this one is pretty cool.  Most of the fun comes from seeing how all the various special abilities work together, as there can be some hilarious combinations of abilities.  In fact, for me, the game was almost more about laughing at all the wacky combinations than anything else.

RATING: 6.25
What an odd game!  Players first bid on various characters which each have a special ability.  Then they secretly select a "runner" for each race.

Most of the abilities involve a chance to alter a basic d6 roll, or move other characters on the board.  You get more points for winning later races.

This is a game with little substance, and the luck of the die roll is very powerful.  That being said, it's simple fun for a group that doesn't mind playing a little dirty.  [Note that the Z-Man edition has stands for the character tokens that don't fit right.]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: Fun graphics. The pawns fit too loosely into the pawn stands.

Experience: Kind of fun. The draft is fun, except that I never get to have my athletes synergize with each other, and it's random who they get paired against, so there isn't any strategy: roll the die, move, use my ability.

Still amusing, though.

This game is great fun and is now my new favourite party game, beating out No Thanks! and Dixit.  The characters are well designed to create tough decisions during the draft, and interact to provide hilarious moments during the race.  The races are even fun to watch for spectators.  The only downsides are that the board is a little bit ugly, and I would have liked a wider player range.

This game works really well with my family of 5.  My 2 boys (ages 8 and 9) like to team up against my daughter (age 5) and myself.  We play in around 75 minutes and everyone in the family really enjoys it. It doesn't seem that long which is a good sign.

The drafting stage is really fun - Tim (8 y.o) wanted to pay 4 for the Centaur because it sounded like so much fun to kick someone back a space!  I talked him out of it and he ended up with the Centaur for cheap. And yes he did really enjoy kicking us back.

One thing, we've never played with the Assassin because it just doesn't seem like fun.

Recommended for light-hearted fun with the kids!  Team play does seem to open it up for more strategy.

RATING: 9
Super light but can be hilariously fun.   Remains engaging because it zips right along.  Picking out your team via the draft is half of the game.   I like the variety of special powers and how most of them are purely optional.  This makes the game especially good for kids as they see the chain reaction of effects that might get triggered if they choose to activate their powers.  Uber-serious gamers will be appalled by Magical Athlete - that's the wrong group to play this with.  The anime art and theme is a really nice touch.   Unfortunately, the stand-up pawns are too tall and narrow and much of the cool art gets cropped off.   That seems inexcusable.  Given the choice between this or another light race game like Ave Ceasar, I would always choose this.   Yeah, it's random and lighter than air.... but so what?  It's simple, silly fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is the game standing atop the podium at the end of a race where the winner is the most dumb, stupid and entertaining game out there. The game is you roll a dice and move your character. The goal to win the race. BUT each racer has a special power (and some are better than others) and before any racing you bid to build your team. All these little elements come together to form a game that never ceases to entertain and provide enjoyment. Never a bad game when playing Magical Athlete.

A ridiculous party game that cannot be played seriously. Holds the record for biggest argument I've had over a game rule. I'm not a fan of the artwork, but gave the game a shot purely for fun.

RATING: 5
In the first phase of the game players draft their team of fantasy athletes (ranging from philosophers to trolls) who then race agaist each other in a series of dicefests. The races are simple roll-and-move spiced up by the various, often preposterous special abilities of the athletes (e.g. the merchant can swap places with another athlete each turn). Some of those are clearly better than others but none of them really serve to make the game any less luck-dependent.

As a game, Magical Athlete is as uninteresting as they get. As an end of session experience where nobody wants to think anymore and everybody gets to shout at everybody else and generally tear their last remaining hair out it does have some value.

This is such a great little game. It's crazy, chaotic and cutthroat and I love it. The game plays fairly quick and can be taught in a minute or two. All the characters special abilties are fun and work well together.

However the bases for the cardboard characters don't fit to well, so you might want to replace them. I kind of like that they're loose, as you're always swapping them anyway. It helps to reduce the wear on the character pawns.

The game can be tense and is a blast to play. Definitely worth the price on this one.

Totally dumb game that I really want to like ... and I [i]almost[/i] do. It takes about an hour to play, but feels like it wants to be a bit shorter game than that. Also, the art on the cards is wonderful, but the stand-up pawns are so narrow that a lot of the artwork is cropped out.

For me, this is worth owning as another easy, low-overhead option for playing with kids and rules-allergic friends from work. The game critic in me says that Magical Athlete is not a good game, but it's possible that he is wrong.

This is a great drafting game. It's very stripped-down and fast-paced game, but it really satisfies. The components aren't great nor is the artwork, but it really doesn't matter much. The race is so thrilling and seems to be a tight finish every time. I like race games anyway, but this one has some really nice twists to it, even if the race itself is pretty chancey.

RATING: 8
Magical Athlete is a race game in which everyone cheats in the wildest ways, but since everyone is doing it it all kind of balances out. Tremendous fun.

The rules take a minute to explain. The drafting phase introduces the athletes one at a time, which makes the first game of this go really well. The dice rolling adds drama, but there are just enough decisions to make to give one a stake in the gameplay and some influence over the race. The spy (which allows a player to know what athletes other players are putting in a given race before deciding who to put in) is surprisingly powerful but I'd say my favourite is the Pirate, who can move any other athlete from anywhere to his place prior to rolling and moving himself! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's pretty stupid but that doesn't stop it from being amusing, in small doses. A simple roll your die and move your guy thing, but with special powers that throw all sorts of wrenches into it. Also, there's a somewhat interesting bidding phase at the beginning where you pick your characters. If you like games with a huge dose of chaos, this might be for you.

This is a very silly roll-and-move racing game made more interesting by characters' special abilities.  The target audience seems to be children, with the simplicity of the basic mechanic and the underlying silliness of the game, but the interactions among the abilities are complex enough to prevent kids from being able to play it without an adult.

This is not a good game, but it is a fun activity.  The decisions are almost all in the drafting, and that will be over in the first ten minutes.  There is a bit of skill in picking your players each time, but not much since it's a blind bid style.  But dammit, this keeps the fun part of roll and move.  Cheer your sixes on!

RATING: 8
This is good silly fun. For me, it's in the same niche as 6 Nimmt!, Dog, Quandary, and Red7 in that there doesn't seem to be all that much control at first (and a lot of gamers will dismiss it), but the decisions (mainly the drafting in Magical Athlete) are not straightforward, and they really can affect who wins. So I like the balance of decisions vs. luck.

A couple minor component upgrades are key: Glue a piece of cardstock (you can cut it from the box insert) to the bottom of the standees so that they don't fall out of their bases, and throw some extra dice in the box so that each player has their own.

Frenzied, multiple character powers racing game for 4 or more players. Pieces and board are cheap, but game play is chaotic fun. Highly recommended. Get a few betting chips or coloured gems to give to people for the betting phase of the game. I've played this with as many as 8 people at a time even though they say its for up to 5.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game although starts unpromisingly as you aren't sure what each athlete can actually do.  Once into the races it takes off with the different character match ups being fun.

Magical Athlete is an absolutely wacky take on roll and move games. In some ways, it almost feels like a parody of them.

It has little depth and a high luck component, but watching the results of each round is amusing to say the least.

It's not a game that I'd play frequently, but it's always good for a laugh from time to time.

RATING: 4
Rating based on version played at Pax with a lot of home made extra random characters. These were extremely unbalanced. Still the interactions were rather boring (roll and move plus use a special power)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
More than just a simple roll and move race game.  The players begin with a draft, until each player has four racers.  Each racer has a distinct special power, which usually affects the rolling or the moving.  Players get points for finishing first or second in a race.  Most points after four races wins.  It's simple and light, but still pretty fun.

Okay, so I don't own the ACTUAL game, but my own re-themed version; I took all of the characters and turned them into references that are of interest to me and my friends. While I will say that this adds a great deal of enjoyment to our games (instead of saying, "My Centaur makes your Ranger move back a space," we get to say, "Jet Li just kicked MacGyver in the face!"), the game is a hoot all on it's own. Sure, you just roll a die and move your dude, but then you get the interplay of all of the special powers and a delightful kind of chaos emerges. The draft is the real seller, though. If you were just dealt random characters you'd probably feel fairly disconnected. But after creating your own team and choosing what race to put them in you really feel like you have someone to cheer on to victory.

I am not prepared for the kind of 'fun' this game offers. The game is overwhelmed by luck. It's BORING! There are hardly any meaningful decisions especially once the races start. Roll-roll-roll-roll.... It's soooo tedious. I have no idea why otherwise rational people claim to enjoy this atrocity.

Magical Athlete is a chaotic fun romp to finish off a game night. The gameplay itself is in the first part a drafting game that leaves players with the illusion that their choices matter. The second half is a roll-and-move game with chaos added by special powers of each athlete. Not that their use poses any difficult decisions but they are what make this game fun. An alternative to MA would be Formula Motor Racing or Leaping Lemmings if you want a bit more decisions that matter.

The idea of the game is really stupid, the roll and move mechanic sounds like a disaster, and the components are substandard to say the least.

This is the type of game that just has to be experienced to understand how fun it can be.  With the right people and a lot of smack talk it can be a blast.

Now it is true that you can be completely hampered by the die rolls (and I have seen this happen), but ordinarily it's not too big of a deal.

My main reservation with the game is that it's probably a little too long for a game of this weight.

While kinda cute, it is very simplistic in that all you do is first draft your 4-5 athletes and then it is only a roll and move game intermixed with the special ability of the participating athletes.  Leads to a fair bit of groans and excitement at times due to how the different unique abilities interact.  Enjoyed my play so far although it is a very light filler at best.

This is a light racing version of Cosmic Encounter. How the characters interact is hilarious, and many laughs will ensue. For a simple roll and move this game packs a lot of punch, and will definitely have plenty of replayability, much like Cosmic Encounter.

다양한 캐릭터들이 벌이는 판타지 레이싱의 결정판.

I enjoyed this game way more than I expected.  Terrible Components, Terrible looking board.  It was our first game so we didn't even bother with the auction for each athlete, we just drafted them based on their appearance.  Watching the races play out, however, is jolly good fun.  You probably need the right group for it, but its light and easy and interesting to see how all the weird powers work against one another.  Planning which race to use which character is neat.  Now, knowing all the powers, it would make the auction interesting.  Overall, not bad.

Game in a Nutshell: Draft yourself a team of unique racers each with their own special ability. Line them up and roll and move your way to the finish line while using your abilities to scratch and claw at the other racers along the way.

Played as: 4,5 player

Pros: Simple-Stupid-Fun. You can teach the game in a minute. Players of all types (age, demographic, etc.) can grasp and enjoy it. No down-time to the game once the races start. It's one of those games that everyone wishes they were playing on game night as they sit optimizing some deadpan euro and they hear cheers, groans, and laughter from the other room. Cure artwork.

Cons: Ok, so this game's roughly 84% luck, if you can't get over that, turn away and never look back. Sucks it's only 4 or 5 players, however necessary. There's a lot of little ticky-tack situations that come along and can break the flow of the game if you let Mr. rules-nazi do so. Occasionally, a race will have a run-away winner when the powers in virtual-randomness choose to not balance. The game plays fast while going, but runs a tad longer then maybe it should. That said, people will likely want to play again and the randomness doesn't stand up well against high-repetition play. Familiarizing yourself with the different racers creates a slight learning curve. The first printing character stands suck and they could have tried beautifying the race track a little.

Other: If you don't have some fun playing this game you need a soul-check. A much better game with 5 players over 4 (I think it would be worth trying with 6). I fixed the character stands with a few strips of clear tape folded over the uprights to narrow the gap. The box says the game takes 60-90 minutes, but I feel comfortable saying go ahead and half that. I normally hate expansions, but I might perk up if this game released a small one. 

Best Use: When you're ready to cut loose and love a game like you're 5 years old again.

I can't say I enjoyed this all that much. Despite the special abilities, the game ultimately came down to the dice. We did just three races, and I really can't see having the patience to do more. This might be good as a children's game, but there's just not much to it for adults. We'll probably try it again just to see all the characters come out and see if there are any combos worth exploring--Carinne thinks there are. But I'd trade this before then were there interest.

A light racing game from Z-Man that is split in two parts. The game begins by the players bidding for athletes from a line up and each athlete acquired forms part of a player's team.

Next come the races, where each athlete will compete once and look to make the most of their special ability to finish 1st. Trick is each player allocates their next athlete without knowledge of the rest of the field. This then forms the nature of the game as each race will play out quite differently based on the combination of powers present.

The game can be quite chaotic and basic movement is still roll and move. Some people get great mileage from it as a 'beer 'n' pretzels' style of game.

I had high hopes for it but ultimately it failed to live up to its potential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The combination of characters can lead to some really funny races.  My favorite part of this game is that you usually don't feel too bad when you lose because the race itself was so ridiculous.

The only real issue with the game (despite the fact that it has the UGLIEST board ever) is that it lasts a little too long.

EDIT: I'm the only one in my group that liked this one.  Out of the collection.

This game is fantastic, a great light game with a bit of strategy, a bit of diplomacy, but quite a bit of luck and humor rolled up in a less than an hour game. The artistic design is Awful,in a barely funny way. That's the main reason buying a copy off of eBay for 50 bucks isn't worth it. This was originally priced 20, and was high for how it looks. Some simple print outs and dice go a long way for a good time until a nice reprint (maybe) comes along. Especially since some people have made some BEAUTIFUL cards and racetracks to print, cheaper than the third-party sellers. The rules have some holes, like infinite loops and power combinations, but they get patched up without too much fuss.

I was really looking forward to this game, I knew something about it, it's about sports, and I thought it would be a good game. I didn't like it at all.

Personally, I found this racing game uninteresting mainly because the rules didn't seem well thought out as to how various cards interact in affecting one another.

RATING: 5
Very light roll-and-move race game which can be entertaining if you're prepared to whoop up the fun which can ensue from watching the special powers interact each race, but my rating has dropped with each play because, after the draft (ie the first 5 minutes of the game), the only decision to make for the other 55 minutes or whatever is the blind choice of which power you'll use this race. Then you sit there like a stuffed chicken seeing if you chose the right one or if you've been completely screwed because of the "random" power choices of the other players which completely accidently negates your super power. *sigh*. The game commences with a draft of the special powers, which goes pretty fast. Each player will buy and later play one power for each race, and these are revealed simultaneously prior to each race. Powers are generally to do with dice / movement / positional manipulation, eg drag someone back to you each turn, move 5 each turn, move 1 each time someone uses a special power, etc. There's fun in watching what seemed a super power be brought to its knees just because it's in the same race as this other one. Otherwise a race turn is to simply roll a d6 and move (but always using your power if you can), first and second home get the points which escalate with each race, most points wins after all races are completed. Good fun if you're ready and up for for gaving good fun, but it could also be a boring roll-and-move game if you want to let it be. The game provides both.

Based on one play: Chose your athletes in a quick auction and then use them in a series of five races. The races are simply roll and move, but using your athlete's power can give you an advantage, Not much strategy, just simple fun, but don't over think it, it is mainly a roll and move.

This game consists of two parts.  The first part is a card draft where you choose your team, the second part is a roll-and-move race.  The cards you drafted gave you various advantages in the race.  I thought that these special abilities were decent, but at its heart this is just a roll-and-move racing game.

Starts out with simple drafting and then turns into a simple roll and move race game. 
Simple, right?
BUT!!!! Each character has a special ability that alters the rules of the game/race.  
These interactions produce a variety of effects.
Some races are over in an instant, some races are a slog.
ALL races are hilarious.

Highest recommendation.

Well, the phrase "silly random fun" does spring to mind here. The game is in the auction phase (knowing the value of the cards) and the meta-game, not really each of the individual races. Trying to play your motley crew in the contest which they'll have the most effect is almost the last decision to make; after that, it's down to die rolls and banter. It's a hard game to 'sell' though, but one I feel would reward repeated play by the same group.

Always generates a lot of laughs.

Unfortunately, drags a bit too long. There are really only about nine decisions you make in this game: five decisions for which athletes will be on your team, and another four to determine which athlete on your team will compete in which race. The races themselves take up the bulk of the duration of the game. Yes, the races are fun, but you feel like a spectator because there are absolutely no difficult decisions to make during the race -- it's basically use your power to screw over who's in the lead.

RATING: 6.5
Magical Athlete is an extremely simple game.  You roll a die six and then move around a board - whomever gets to the finish line wins that round.  The twist is that your player pieces (or athletes) each have special abilities that affect other player's athletes.

At the start of the game players bid on cards the represent the athletes.  Some athletes' special abilities are much better than others, so you want to bid high for those.  However, you must have a certain number of athletes on your team (5 in a four player game for example) and you have a finite amount of credits to bid with.  If you bid too high early you'll end up with 2 great cards and 3 other guys no one wants.  I found the drafting aspect a lot of fun.

After drafting, each player secretly selects a single athlete for the first race.  In a 4 player game, there are 5 races with victory points given for first and second places.  Later race victories are worth more than earlier ones, so often the best cards are used late (although you can try to dominate the first few races and win that way if no one else has that idea :) ).

Racing was simplistic - but I did have a good bit of fun, and it was comical picturing what these races would have looked like.  The group I played with laughed and had fun, so it was a success.

Bottom line - Magical Athlete is a pretty fun, but very simple, game.  Its quite random - so if you are looking for deep strategy or hate "luck of the dice" games leave this one behind.  Fun for a quick game occasionally if not taken too seriously.

Depending on the set-up, some races can be a bit of a bore (e.g. Assassin, Thief, Druid & Philosopher) but some are out of this world.  My last game saw me and the other player in contention for the win having a completely fruitless tussle between my Pirate and his Merchant.  The one previous had a Necromancer mined for all its worth to try and drag back another player from the finish line.

Highly recommended.

Now I just have to get it to the table. I hear it's a fun, silly game. Just need lots of peeps at the same time to give it a whirl.

It's a roll and move with a few special powers, the usage of which is not an interesting decision. You basically just wait for someone to win.

On the plus side, it's short enough that the torture is soon over.

Nice little game from Z-Man.  The production quality is piss poor, but that doesn't really detract from the game.

Im not a huge fan of dice-race mechanics, but this game at least has some interesting characters with abilities that make each race worth the 15+ rolls it can require.

Points as cash seem way out of wack...  you have to draft 4 characters, with 6 'points' and you'll need to spend 3 on a good character.  Seems too tight for me.

Super easy to grasp, plays fast and fun.

A lot of people would assume that after the drafting this game kind of plays itself, but that's simply not true. A large portion of the gameplay is keeping an eye on your racer to make sure you remember to use it's special ability, while praying other players will forget to use theirs.

It's nice to play a game that remembers that "fun" is the most basic element of a game. It's stupid, random, and kind of janky looking, but it's a total hoot. If you can never derive any pleasure from playing Magical Athlete, you probably aren't a very fun person.

An auction, then a few silly races with silly powers of silly characters. Would play it more, but it requires at least four. The character stands that come with it are trash, though.

RATING: 3
A real disappointment.  Character artwork is nice.  I wish more games took risks on artwork.

Drafting is dull and limited to the first 5 minutes of the game (the boring races are the other 30-40 minutes), character selection is blind (perhaps some minimal risk assessment based on other racers, but not really), then roll one d6 50 times to execute the race (also, some false decisions during the race). Rinse and repeat the blind selection and rolling four times.  The choices during the race range from easy to non-existent.

The apparent inspiration for the game is Chutes and Ladders.

This is a really neat little fantasy racing game. At first glance it doesn't seem like anything special, but once you start playing you really get into it. One of my friends described it as a sort of foot race, board game version of Super Mario Kart. I think that is a good way to describe this game.

RATING: 10
Seems ludicrously simple, doesn't it? Draft a team of four or five Magical Atheletes. Atheletes are secretly selected to run in a series of races with increasing stakes. Roll and move. Prize points go to first- and second-place finishers. Most points at the end wins.

That said, it plays way bigger than its rules.

There's a lot of chaos here - atheletes appear in the draft in random order and interact in surprising ways, they're entered into races secretly so there's lots of second-guessing who your opponent is going to run, there can be huge swings in standing due to a few die rolls, someone will always, ALWAYS assassinate your favorite athelete which you paid top dollar for (which in my case is always the Cultist), there's plenty of kingmaking... you get the idea. Further, atheletes respond differently to different coaching styles and your overall standing is tightly correlated with the quality of your shit-talk.

So it may be impervious to the clout of true strategy, but good god damn is it fun. I've introduced it to dozens of other people, gamers and non-gamers, and _nobody_ has been disappointed. It's hard to talk up a game that sounds so retarded on paper, and I don't want to go overrating it or anything, but Magical Athelete hits a sweet spot of being simple, quirky, short, and out-of-control. 

Update: Holy bat farts on a bus! BEST GAME EVER.

I'm bummed to see that Z-Man renamed the Wrestler as a "Martial Artist" (seriously, _you_ look at his picture and tell me which makes more sense) and inexplicably changed the Cultist to a Pirate. Also that they've misspelled the title, which is Magical Ath[b]e[/b]lete. But I'm glad that Zev is bringing this to a wider audience and upping the quality of the original's components. Come on, Gen-Con attendees! Where are photos of the reprint?!

It's a roll-and-move, but it's fun! Players all start with seed money, used to draft a team of racers. The racers come out in random order, and each have a unique power (mostly modifying movement rules, sometimes giving extra pre- or post- race abilities). The draft is as follows: shift any unbought racers down one step on the board (decreasing prices as they shift), then add a new card to the display. If all spaces full, must buy one. After players have their racers (a few will remain out of game), there will be 4 or 5 races. For each race, players secretly simultaneously choose a racer. Then, in turn order, simply roll d6 and move your racer. Of course, special powers modify movement throughout the race. The first 2 finishers score VP (more VP in later races); most VP after all races wins!

It might be nice if the race track wasn't simply a track of 25(?) spaces -- maybe different routes, etc. But really it's not necessary: the fun comes from the crazy interactions of all the special powers. And, of course, you get to cheer or boo when the dice are rolled. A definite hit!

I LOVE these types of games where you're drafting a team and then there's some light-hearted competition with dice or cards.  SO MUCH FUN!  In fact, it reminds me of Slapshot, one of my all-time favorites.  I would love to really sink my teeth into this one and play it a ton to see which cards really are the best and vice versa.  Of course, this is coming from someone who enjoyed racing Monopoly tokens around the board as a kid.  Maybe there's another game idea for a Monopoly variant in there somewhere?

Very fun game with some significant issues.
 (1) It's ugly and the components are crap
 (2) Some of the powers/interactions are too FAQ-y. I believe more thought could have been put into them. And other powers that aren't necessarily wonky do little more than remove fun from the game.
 (3) It's out of print.

RATING: 10
Big laughs and chaotic and fast gameplay make this a winner for me.  

Draft your magical atheletes then secretely select one for each of the four races. The special powers interact in crazy ways for humorous results. The whole game is done in a half hour and leaves you anxious to play again.

Special thanks to Frank Branham for pulling this piece of weirdness out of his swamp and to Zev for publishing it. I am going to play my copy till my hands bleed.

RATING: 7
I was prepared to write off this game as a mindless luckfest, but it turns out it's actually pretty fun. The quick auction/drafting round contains the gameplay element that gives impact to the flurry of dice rolling. 

However, it's hard to bring this to a new table because the drafting doesn't work properly until everyone has played a few games and seen all of the cards - at which point, man, you've seen all of the cards! You're probably bored with the game already. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Take a round of drafting racers, then secretly pick one at a time to compete in a roll and move race. This sounds terrible, but the interaction of powers lead to a lot of amusement. Still not to be taken seriously - this is mostly a "game" of luck and evil kingmaking and "take that". Good for lots of laughs.

Clearly I'm an idiot.  I owned this game for about 6 months and never played it.  I then gave it away in a Christmas exchange only to repurchase it 10 months later.  I finally got it played and....

WOW! Roll and move should not be so much fun.  This game takes a super-simple concept and makes it into a total blast.  There's just enough game here to make some interesting decisions in the draft.  Once you start racing, all Hell breaks loose!

Buy this game and play it.

1 play with 4 players.  As I explained the rules, everyone seemed kind of skeptical.  Could this really be any fun?  Half way through the game however, everyone was rolling around laughing and yelling at each other!  When we finished, everyone wanted to play again.

It's really not the greatest game ever, but it was surprisingly fun to recruit your own team and see how they complete.

I'm going to go ahead and rate it a 9 after a single play.  The only--and I stress only--things that keep it from being a 10 is that it has to have at least 4 players, and it takes over an hour.  

But man, you cannot ask a game to pack more into such a simple package.  From the draft to the race, it is a noisy, wild, and obnoxious game that is full of miracles, outright meanness, heartbreak and hilariously bizarre matchups.

Please do yourself a favor--don't take it seriously, pick up this ridiculously cheap game, and be reminded of what games are supposed to be.  Fun.

Magical Athlete is a racing game with fantasy creatures. Some races are more entertaining than others. I found it difficult to find exactly 4 or 5 players who would be interested in playing this esp. during a local meetup where other shiny new games were being played. I like this one enough but it's too difficult to find players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The draft seems kind of silly since there is no reason not to spend all your points. I expect you could get much the same effect by simply dealing the cards out randomly. On the other hand, it's better than the races, which take way too long to play out. 

It might improve the game if, after the first race, the players chose characters in descending order of score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
hmmmm... not sure about all the hooplah about this one.  I thought the card interactions would be more interesting based on what I had read but it's pretty basic stuff.  We played a "team" version, each player having two runners, which at least allowed for some combos and thought behind which characters you're going to team up. Even so, there's no way Magical Athlete compares in any way to a game like Cosmic Encounter.  

There are some games that look simple on paper but when you play them they transform into something much richer than the rules on the page (Space Hulk for instance).  I thought Magical Athlete might have been the same way and gave it a shot, but so far the experience has been flat and with a disappointing amount of "huh, that's it?"  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
People are right - based on the rules, this game should not be as fun as it is. The amount of fun that you will get out of a race depends solely on the special abilities of the characters racing, which means that some races are much more interesting than others. But with certain combinations of characters, races can be hilarious. At the end of the day, however, be aware of the fact that success is still highly dependent on the luck of the dice. Still, this is a game that I am always willing to play. Too bad the components (standups that do not fit their bases, seriously low quality cardstock) are a bit of a let down.

This game is more fun than it should be'. Saw this quote somewhere in the forum and I whole heatedly agree with the conclusion. I never thought these racing type games using dice is my cup of tea, but boy, this game is a hoot with the right folks. Light-hearted and very chaotic, this game has all the right ingredients for a super-filler. Players get to race wacky characters with varying super powers. These powers essentially alter the course of the game by messing with the die roll or the character movement. Kudos to the designer for picking the right powers to fit each character. In the end, the die rolling is critical for winning the game but does not ultimately define each race. Different combination of character powers give rise to different scenarios each game. This makes the game fresh and exciting.

This is a fantastic game playable even with my 4 year old.  I think the sweet spot age it 7+ but if you have a group that is not turned off by the "magical athletes" theme, this is a fun game to play with a group of adults (i.e. I LOVE to play this game with adults as you can get a little more cutt throat).  Finally, there is nothing even close to this in my collection, so this fills a nice niche.

RATING: 5
One play (Z-Man ed.), provisional rating.  Nice idea, I like the art and concept and there are laughs to be had, but the rules are not tight enough and some of the characters seem 'broken' (Philosopher!).  I accept that with 25 unique abilities the rules can't explicitly mention every interaction, but the designers responsibility is to structure the gameplay and word the rules clearly enough so that ambiguities do not occur. I accept that the auction will ensure that players pay more for the more powerful characters, but it removes the fun from a race when your opponent has a clear starting advantage, or whose ability is to deny you your own ability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a lot of fun even though everything is determined by the roll of the dice. There's really no strategy to speak of, but the art is fun at least.

The play time is too long for what it is though, and the supported player number is pretty bad. If it supported a broader player number and was 30 minutes shorter I would give it as much as an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Roll and move that doesn't fail!  This game is all about the crazy special powers, and how they play off each other.  It's got echoes of [gameid=172] with the two stages.  In stage one, you buy your racers, and then in stage two, you use those racers to win races for you.  And like For Sale, it's light, fast and easy and makes for a great gateway game or great filler.  Some races can end up being duds if all the player powers are pretty boring, but many of them are a lot of fun, and quite clever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is rated as a party/filler type of game.  Some games are just inexplicably fun to play, and that's all there is to it.  I do like how the athletes are distributed at the beginning of the game, even though the outcomes of the races are typically pretty random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A roll and move race game. Who'da thunk in this day and age?

Players draft athletes, each of which has a magical ability, such as re-rolling the dice, swapping positions with other racers, advancing on other player's rolls, etc. Each costs a different amount, and when one is purchased, the remainder slide down to fill in the gaps, becoming cheaper for the next player to buy. You have very limited funds to buy your 5 racers, so it's important to judge when you have to spend a lot for a racer you want, or to buy a cheap one just to save money.

Players secretly choose one of their racers to run each race, which can lead to interesting combos as magic abilities clash, or work together to really push one racer forward. Or backward, in my case.

Ultimately, much of the race just comes down to rolling well on the dice, but if you're the sort of player like Scott is and makes Troll noises every time his troll moves, then there's enjoyment to be had here.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great race game where all the runners have special powers that help them or hurt others during the race.  It plays quick, rules are pretty easy to learn.  I would say that once one becomes more familiar with the characters the initial draft becomes much more competitive.

Some are convinced that the essence of gaming bliss has been distilled into this "draft, race & roll" slimline package.  Those people are, with all due respect, both drunk [i]and[/i] high, as being just one or the other wouldn't be sufficient for someone to talk themselves into such a reality-free viewpoint. 

In terms of pacing and "do we keep playing?" concerns, the game makes its lighthearted point by the end of the third race.  As race number four begins, most folks will start to wonder how much time is left in the evening, and whether the final races will conclude in time for another game to start.

And lest you decry my comments as a kneejerk reaction from a eurofied naysayer, I should take a moment to communicate my extremely high tolerance of all things arbitrary and silly.  It's just that I can think of any number of other gaming options that are significantly more entertaining when I'm in the mood for 30-60 minutes of young-at-heart relaxation: The Adventurers, DungeonQuest, Drakon, Micro Mutants, Castle Ravenloft, Red November, Cloud 9, Ring-o Flamingo, Loopin' Louie, etc.

But yes, for the target audience (families), Magical Athlete will support a number of memorable plays - especially if you're a family that up until now has only been exposed to mass market offerings.  But if your kids have been exposed to even a few modern family games, their interest in Athlete will likely burn out after only a few sessions.

[rated mostly as a family game, although I reserve the right to modify my score after further kid-testing]

Update:

No matter which races, powers, and benevolent deities are involved, those who roll well tend to win and those who roll poorly tend to lose.  But it's still goofy fun, so I've raised my rating a bit.

This is a silly, roll-and-move race, driven by a draft of characters before the races, and CCG-style ability interactions.

Although the combinations will vary, it reduces the feeling of freshness on subsequent plays.  The illustrations are cute and fun!

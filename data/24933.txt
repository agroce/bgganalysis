The only part I don't like is the humming - Everyone knows I can't hum or whistle a tune to save my life.

RATING: 7
A terrific party game that takes the fun of Cranium, but strips the board.  You get to rank the different communication methods of subjects, which can be extremely fun if you know the other team well.  But, after a few turns, you basically have the other team's abilities down to a science, meaning turns might yield only one or two points, dragging the game on forever.  Need at least 4 players to make this work as well.

Non-gamer fun.  We used to play this all the time before we found much better games.

RATING: 6
This game surprised me. Not a bad party game. There is some strategy and satisfaction involved in assessing how to minimize the other team's points by guiding their attempts at how to come up with answers. I really think the proprietary names that the game uses for drawing, sculpting, humming, miming, and the dice letters are ridiculous, confusing, and unnecessary. Other than that this seems a pretty solid and fun party game.

A nice twist added to the Cranium franchise.  It picks up the pace from the traditional Cranium game which is a big plus.  I like how you can select which activity will best suit the word/phrase you are trying to get your teammates to guess.  It is a very successful party game, but many of the cards are directed more towards adults so this isn't one that the kids can join in on.  Still it can be a lot of fun with other couples and in large group settings.

Much more enjoyable that standard Cranium.  Good one to have on the shelf if you want to keep a party game around.

I'm not a huge fan of Cranium and this newer version doesn't really do a whole lot for me either. The box size and shape is super annoying in regards to storage.

A pop culture party game with more sizzle than steak.

We loved this game.  Works with just about any size of group.  We do a lot of things with HUGE groups, and this fits the mark better than most party games.  Brilliant.

An improvement on the original Cranium, the mini-games are more fun (gone are the spelling and trivia mini-games) and there is no random movement, the game progresses at a rate related to how difficult your challenges are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Was surprised by this game. Fixes a lot of problems with the original Cranium; mainly the crazy variance in question difficulty by allowing the players to determine difficulty level. Overall a pretty fun game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a very well designed party game, ideal for 8-12 people in teams.  I have only played it once (not my copy), and we actually had a very enjoyable and humorous time.

RATING: 5
Fun for a few plays, but dated now so off it goes.

RATING: 6
BEST FEATURE: The clue giver gets to choose the method of clue deliver (charades, drawing, humming, play dough scupting, or verbal clues starting with 1 of 5 random letters)
WORST FEATURE: small box of answer cards (solution: use answer cards from other games.)

RATING: 6
This is a fun casual game where you get to determine the difficulty for the opposing team. However, this is one you have to play with the right people, or it can drag.

This is a decent party game, and the twist of having the other team decide what points you will get for each category makes it more interesting.  Do you want to get the easy point, or go for a higher total in a category you aren't confident in?  If I am forced to play a party game, this isn't a bad choice.

RATING: 6
Best variation of Cranium thus far.  Players can choose which action they want to do and get different amount of points based on the order the other team puts the actions in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My favorite of the Cranium games.  Fun for the other team because they get to decide how many points each of the activity choices get, challenging for the player that drew the card because you have to decide between easy but low points or hard and higher points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Frickin' party games. What can you say, really? They're reasonably fun and people scream and shout but when the dust settles you're still left hollow inside. Why is it so difficult to get groups of people to play real games, like Wallenstein?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of my favorite party games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent take on the popular Party Trivia game which mixes 5 popular styles of play in to one excellent package. Charades, Pictionary, Sculpt, Humming & Letter Dice for word hints.  
 
 The only real downside to this game is that you are limited to the original 700 or so cards.  Which are based in the 80's-90's...and early 2000's.  So your audience may be a little more limited.
 
 Great large group party games.

Our favorite Cranium product to date.  Great for parties and battle of the sexes type events.  Some of the challenges are stale, thanks to heavy play of Cranium.  Sculpting and drawing have lost their charm.  The game comes down to picking the task that is assigned the most points that your team will be able to guess in time.  There is the potential for metagaming the score values to trick someone into an impossible task.

It's like several party games in one and you can choose how to get your team to guess your word/celebrity/movie/whatever. The opposing team selecting the point values for each method is a brilliant little twist rarely seen in party games. As long as people don't get overly bogged down in ranking the methods, this game is a lot of fun.

Kind of like Cranium but without the board. You just do the cards. Some of the pop culture though I was unfamiliar with but that's to be expected.

RATING: 8
Great party game. Tons of variety. The core machine is fun to manipulate. There is something for everyone, any given player can use the cubes to explain their clue, act out their clue, draw their clue, sculpt their clue, or even hum their clue. Lots of variety and fun in the box for the right crowd. Once of the best party style games out there.  Should be a hit for any crowd.

Steer clear of this one! The deciding votes are entirely subjective. If your line of reasoning is different (better, in my case) from the other players, then you can't score.

RATING: 7
Like its namesake this game offers a lot of different things to do. It offers it in a different way though. This one you get to decide which thing you want to try and the other team wagers against you. It added another dimension to an already fun game.

It's okay as party games go but there are party games I like much more.  I like the concept of the 5 pop choices but some answers are easier and some are nearly impossible, so luck of the draw has as much to do your "cranium skills".  Or, maybe I suck at it.

RATING: 8
Very fun party game... it has the flexibility of letting the clue giver select their method for communicating the clue.  However, the opposing team can arrange methods for communication so that the "easier" ones are worth less points.

I still get laughed at for my humdinger of the Energizer Bunny.
Purchased for 6.87 at Target.

I can see the appeal of games like this, but they absolutely aren't my thing.  I'm no good with the pop culture, and I hate getting a card, staring at it, and then having to look at my team and say, "Sorry guys, I haven't got a clue."

(11/15) 7.

(9/17) Drop to 5. Another really good game that I haven't played in a little while that I don't really feel compelled to bring out.  Partially because there are so many great games, partially because of how many people are required.

This game is essentially Cranium with a twist.  There is a bit more strategy in this version, however, it doesn't fit quite well in this setting.  Given the choice to play this or Cranium, Cranium will win every time.

I think this is the best of the Cranium series.  Opponents rank how you get a topic in classic cranium styles, and you choose easy way for less points or harder for more.  Its just more fun than the original cranium or family fun.  Typical cranium things of acting, clay, drawing, humming, and the letter dice.

Better than Cranium, because you can choose what you want to do. The problem is that you need to know the pop culture references.

Fun for people into pop culture, but it's gonna get dated pretty quickly, especially with some of those obscure songs.
I still think it's fun if you're well versed in pop culture from the 80s to the 2000s.
Just ignore the clay.

In the same vein as Cranium (of course), but this works better. The fact that the team on the spot gets to pick what they want to do makes all the difference. Lots of laughter.

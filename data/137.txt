It can be harder than it sounds like to come up with words! Plus, the die really doesn't match anything about what you're trying to do with the letters on the card. That bit is weird.

Still, fun and generates some laughs. A good filler.

Pass the Bomb is a very simple party game on the brink of not being a game at all: there’s even a moderate amount of fun involved, which means just mocking the guy who didn’t find a matching word in time. The umpteenth time this happens the fun is all but vanished and the game becomes pretty boring (especially if you’re that guy).

I like the idea, but the actual gameplay is not that great. I love word games and speed games, and this combines both, so I should be happy about it - the reason I am not is because the bomb detonates randomly, so you don't have any influence on if you win or lose. Well, of course, if you suck and cannot create any words with the letters, the bomb will detonate in your hands, but you should be able to pass it on. And then suddenly one player loses because the time is up. Great idea, but ultimately too random.

This game is just about coming up with words with a letter pattern in them.  Even with the random timer, it's just not interesting.  For me at least, that is not a challenging activity.  See also Wordsters, My Word! and many others.

Nice family game, the idea is to make words with cards showing the beginning of the end of the word, the dice determines whether it should be put at the front or the end of the word. When the bomb explodes and it's your turn, you get a card. After thirteen games, the player with the least number of cards wins.

I disliked this game.  Sure, part of it was because I lost.  But I also realized after the game that the reason I lost was because I was actually listening to other people's words.  I was thinking to myself, hey, that's a pretty cool word.  There was no room to learn these cool words other people were saying, though.  I would prefer something that rewards thought.  Yes, even in a party game.

RATING: 5
First played July 24th, 2008. Taught in 2min, played in ~20min. This game has emphais on  vocabulary and word and pattern recongniton. 13 cards are placed in the center of the table. Someone rolls the dice. If it lands on the bomb then you have to say a word, however it can't end with the letters on the card. If it lands on the "tick" then the word can't start with the letters. If it lands on tick-tock the letters can be anywhere. Start the bomb timer, the start player says a word and passes the bomb left and repeat. The player holding the bomb at the end takes a card and starts the next round. The player with the fewest cards wins. It's a good party game and more for the wordy players, give it a try if you are looking for a new party game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2017)

I was pleasantly surprised by Pass the Bomb, it is a good party game to play from time to time.

The rules of the game are pretty easy to teach. You can do it under 1 minute. Playtime is around 20 minutes.

The goal is pretty simple, when you have the bomb you need to pass it quickly before it explodes, you do that by saying words with specific letters on them and there are some limits to where the letters can beas well (you roll a die for the limits). The bomb has a variable timer which was too soft (perhaps due to the battery) so I had to replace it. It was hard to replace at first but with an app you can replace it, however you lose some tension without the sound of the bomb.

It can be hard to see who gets the bomb when it goes off when you are passing it, it can be a bit unfair this way.

At first I thought the language was going to be a barrier, because English has many combinations that aren’t in my own language (Spanish), but we didn’t have a problem with that. I need more plays to verify if this is an issue or not. 

Pass the Bomb ca be used to help create vocabulary.

Bottom line, Pass the Bomb is a light and fun party game to play from time to time. I’m still undecided if I should keep it or not but I will play it again before deciding.

A great little party game -- incredibly tense (the ticking of the bomb does NOT help you think) and quick to play. The random timer is a clever device, and makes it tough even for good players to consistently avoid points. Simple, tense, and fun is a good mix for a party game.

I'd say it's easier for folks who like word games (who generally have a better vocabulary, and are used to accessing it more rapidly), but it's not really a word game. It's enough of one that some folks will dislike it more or less instantly on that basis, though.

Surprisingly, Pass the Bomb also plays really well with a small group. We've tried three, and it's just as tense and fun as it is with more people. In fact, I think it might be a bit more tense, because you get the bomb back so quickly.

Social word game that's probably not for advanced Scrabble players... you can't use Scrabble words, it's just too simple and the concept of word similarity is fuzzy. For example, if UNGRATEFUL is used, can I use INGRATE? What about HUNGRY / HUNGRILY? I would argue no to both, but the rules (of the game, and of social word game etiquette generally) is yes to both.

Having to come up with a word containing a specific combination of letters, that has not already been used by your opponents, and before the bomb ticking away in your hand goes off--now that's what I call pressure!  Every time the bomb goes off during your turn, you collect a penalty in the form of the card with the current letter combination on it.  Whenever your group decides to stop playing (or when the bomb's battery goes dead--whichever comes first), the player with the least number of cards wins.  Simple.  Exciting. A fun way to fill a few minutes when there isn't time for a longer game.  And the bomb is a great little artifact that Wylie Coyote would gladly trade his anvil for. (3+3)

Wow... i suck at this game.  :)  There's something about coming up with words from only a few letters stuck in the middle or at the end that's hard for me (though if they are at the beginning of the word, those are usually easier).  It's a fun (albeit nerve-wracking) game as the random timer (in the form of a ticking time bomb) counts down.  I got creamed the first time playing this one... but i think the more i play the more i'll improve.  It's win-win, really.  :P

Excellent pressure-filled party game that highlights your word-finding ability.  Love the bomb, too - one of the better gizmos in a game.

RATING: 5
A fun party game that creates laughs watching people unravel under time pressure, and when it goes off completely unfairly as someone is quickly passing it on. Having said that, I'm not a huge fan of time pressure games because it can generate frustration and a sense of sameness with constant replay, so for me it's only an occasional outing when there's a large crowd, and this keeps it fresh.

A quick novel game, the addition of the bomb makes what would be a very ordinary game into something exciting. Not a game that I'd want to play all evening, but a good time filler.

OMG, of course, it's abritrary as you never now when the bomb explodes and you have little to no influence to it, but it's fun to hear the word that come people in mind... :D

RATING: 5
(10+ plays)  This game is a lot of fun.  The rules are a little off and poorly written (or at least that's my excuse for playing it wrong and disliking it many times).  As a bonus, you can tweak the game with your own rules for a lot of variety, or make up an entirely new game with or without the cards - the timer is great as a party game tool to have around.

Pretty harmless.  Hot potato plus a word game.  Perhaps a little too difficult or stressful for truly young kids, but nine and up can have a good time.  
Got it for five bucks at an antique store...felt like a steal after playing it for an hour.

As with so many word games, this one relies on having an evenly literate group of players.  One or two people who don't know words as well as the others and this turns into an embarrassing and painful episode.  For more on that theme, see Beyond Balderdash.

A decent word game with word game problems - namely people get weird ideas and one needs a dictionary. Playing this with kids was even more so as who needs effort when we can bluff. Somehow I like Manitu better as it's shorter and more nonsensical. But this one is okay for what it is. I'm just not that crazy about it.

[Piatnik 1994 edition] {Party, word; word identification, electronic device; optimal 5-6p} Pass the bomb is an exciting and hectic party word game.  I don't often fancy word games but it's a good game for student to build vocabulary and understand etymology. It's getting more fun when the bomb is going faster! I tried a few times to say a word slowly to introduce excitement, but often failed to pass the bomb :cry: Evil mind just won't work. 

Without the bomb, this game will just go dead. When the bomb is alive, the game continues to be alive. * blessing * Long live the bomb! 

The game can be twisted to play other things :laugh:; e.g. say a noun similar to happy, etc. But my friend will be mad about this :devil: . (how can one use the dice then?)

[Pass the bomb Junior] This edition is really a good game for children. The cards are cute and the contexts are appropriate. It should be a good game to own, too.

I'm not a big fan of word games, to be fair and it certainly doesn't help that I have the worst vocab of my friends.  But this is also not my favorite format for a word game.  The time pressure is stressful and seems to me just to make what would otherwise be no game at all into an okay game, rather than to really enhance the game.  The result of the time pressure is that you either have some word or you sit there somewhat stunned and shocked.  Not how I like to play games.

It's a party game, and not the best. I like the bomb component. I had some fun playing the game. 

My advice? The player who has the bomb when it blows, should drink a shot. 

Drinking games!!! That's the way to have fun, kids!

ps: Alcohol kills brain cells...

One of the best designed word games ever. The introduction of dice for additional restriction on the formation of words adds extra fun and challenges to the game. Many of my friends are impressed by the ticking bomb which adds tension and... make them often unable to make a word until the bomb is gone. lol.Hong Kong people are not native english speakers. Better play with those who can manage word games. I always like to play this game with word gamers. The experience is really enjoyable... even someone has to lose. ;)This is once a game showing your WORD POWER than your pure vocabulary.

After 1 Play: Fun game, but hard to challenge a word when there's such a demanding time limit.  You really have to play with the optional 'no other forms of a word in a round' rule, but this of course leads to disagreement over what is or is not a form of a previous word.

Here you acquire cards and power them by discarding the appropriate power. The interesting bit is you can 'exchange' an aquired card to activate its Dominion-like power, but doing so offers it up to your opponent to score. Plays quite quickly and is fun with two. Perhaps will try again with more players, but fear a leader bashing result. For all that, not a bad game. Visually very pretty.

Played it at PAX Australia. Preliminary rating for the basic game. Some interesting economic mechanisms in this one, with a Race for the Galaxy style tension between building out fast to win early or building upwards to maximise points. With repeated play should become quite a fast game and fit the 30-45 min spot very well.

RATING: 5.5
Never play this game with 6, the down time between turns can get rather lengthy, especially later in the game when people start chaining powers to extend out their turns.  Overall it is not a bad civ building type game where not only do you have access to your contracts but also other people's contracts, making this a bit of a cut throat game too.  But with mechanics similar to Alhambra and an upgrade system that never really mattered except when drawing cards, I can't recommend this game, and if you liked this game I think you will like Alhambra more.

Rise to Power is a very interesting city-building card game. It is easy to learn, yet addictive!

The most interesting part for me is the upgrading and exchange mechanism. Players can upgrade their districts by putting the district on top of another one only with the same name and less influence points. This allows players to accumulate their influence points but not using any grid connection (despite the first district that completed).
Exchange is very powerful yet risky! While players have one or more incomplete district, they have abilities that can be used. Some of them can get you more Prisms or districts. Some can be offensive like taking other players district or even destroy their districts! The risky part is, after using the ability, that particular district card will be put on "The Exchange". This allows players to gain that card into their play area as a COMPLETED district, for free!

I am glad that I play tested this game, simple components but the game design requires you to be strategic. Hidden agendas that each players have will provide more variables in each play. For people who like card games or strategy games, I would totally recommend it.

The artwork is beautiful and I love the theme and story that comes out through the images and graphic design. But sadly, the gameplay isn't very intuitive and none of us had fun actually playing the game.  I wish it was different but sadly it wasn't meant to be.

It is an OK game, and it could be a great game. If the exact placements of cards mattered more, it'll push me into loving it. As it currently stands, it is a highly forgettable game. Unfortunately in this day and age, a game might as well not exist, if it was just an "OK game"

RATING: 3
Card tableau building for points with double sided cards. The idea is neat but the tableau building part feels unfinished since there isn't much of a factor in where you place the cards in relation to others. The game seems to reward randomness too much by given extra actions to players who happen to be able to get prism cards from the offer (or drawn randomly) that fit a contract they can get.

The weirdest part for me is the power exchange cards that seem to just hand victory points to the player on your left that doesn't seem to be balanced in a multiplayer game. Maybe a better two player filler tableau game.

The powering a city theme seems to be there in the cards but not much in the gameplay unlike other games with a similar theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's a lot of interesting things going on in this game and I really enjoy the cardplay but unfortunately the "city building" is very underwhelming. Even though there are restrictions to where cards can be played, you never get into a situation where you can't play a card so it seems pointless to even have the restrictions in the first place.

I feel like this game could be improved with some more iterations but as is it's just ok.

Éreztem, hogy ez egy nekem való játék lesz. Jó kis kombózós tablóépítés, városfejlesztéses témával. Hatalmas újítás talán nincs nagyon benne, de jól össze van rakva az egész. Első játékra csak kapkodtuk a fejünket, hogy mire kéne akkor most igazából figyelni. Ez általában a jó kombós játékok sajátja, amikkel azért kell párat tolni, hogy összeálljon a kép. Érdekes mechanika benne a lapdobás valami aránylag nagy előnyért, amivel viszont hozzásegíthetjük egy ellenfelünket egy gyakorlatilag ingyen laphoz. Az interakció is érdekes mivel el lehet venni az ellenfelek félkész épületeit. Ez egy nagy adag kitolási lehetőséget ad a játékhoz, de annyira alapeleme a játéknak, hogy nem igazán fájdalmas. 
Egyetlen fenntartásom van vele hosszú távon: úgy érzem, hogy azért a prizmahúzás sokat számít. 
Alig várom már a következő party-t.

Dissapointing -- or did I have the wrong expectations?
For example there's a page dedicated to rules constraining where contracts may be placed, suggesting there may be some clever city-building process (a la Suburbia); where in fact placement has zero impact on the game (a la San Juan).

Fun game. Simple and easy to understand, but with many different strategies that make replay value very high. The modular expansions help with that even more!

Artwork is very stylized and well done. Graphic design is also very good and even takes color-blind players into consideration.

In the handful of times I've played it though, no one has used an exchange ability unless it's the last turn in the game. No matter how amazing an exchange ability is, giving the next player free influence points never seems to be a thing players are willing to do.

I played the basic version once at a demo booth at PAX AU. I wanted to buy it immediately. Nice brain tickle, clear goals, systemic expansion that works witht the theme, beautiful and professional art and graphic design, and an element of bluffing as you try to trap players into making bids on your power contracts only to fill them in response. I want.

Rise to Power isn't really my type of game, but it was enjoyable and engaging, with a very approachable weight. I have seen all the mechanics before and there's nothing about it that's terrible innovative or eye-opening, but it had a really nice flow and I'd recommend it as a card-based Euro. I played an early version and was told there's more player interaction on the way, so I'm definitely interested in the final KS version. Some guy rated it 3 (KS hater?), which is the only rating, so I'm giving it 8.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed my first play. Two card types - currency cards and contract cards which need to be paid for to flip using the currency cards. Exact payment results in another free action a la Alhambra. There are three abilities that can and must be upgraded from the contracts built including drawing more currency cards, larger hand size, and allowable number of districts in your city. The upgrade option allows for moving contracts just completed on top of a lower level card of the same type to open up another district space. Also, one has the option to use these contracts for their special action which is the most interesting part of the game - to do so one discards the contract to another table location and takes a powerful action on the card. However, this does mean the next player can then build the card for free and it comes built.

I found the game very enjoyable.  The game tends to finish just as things are starting to really get crazy leaving you with the desire to play again.  I played the game twice and both times I found it quite compelling and there was a lot of choices to be made.  

In fact in the second game I made choices that solidified my second place position but also gave the platform for the next player to overtake me.  The whole risk vs reward concept behind the exchange and the exchange abilities on the contract cards was great fun.

I recommend the game as it is definitely a game I'd like to play many more times.

RATING: 8
Chang and Kearney's first game, a quick city builder, is really impressive. Players use cards to build a city, somewhat of an engine builder and power it up often comboing to trigger other actions. Cards can also be played into an exchange, triggering it's power but allowing future players to take it and add to their VPs. You can also play cards to take over other players' contracts from their city, those players can defend if they have the right cards to make the payment themselves.

Fairly straight-forward and plays in well under an hour. Surprising for a game with some serious decisions.

A tableau building game about powering a sci-fi world using a new energy source called prism.  Everything in the game works, but its rather dry and unremarkable.  Also the random draw of "prism" makes me feel like I cannot do what I want, but that I have to do what the random draws permits.

Yeah, I guess the restrictions on play make sense thematically (your infrastructure can only power so many districts), but it still manages to feel really abstract (I don't have any more room for districts, so I'm just unable to play this card).

I feel that the game focuses on mechanics that don't mesh with my playing style.  For example, I thought the challenge mechanic was really fun, but the game doesn't seem to provide a reward proportional to the risk it entails.  It's also one of those games that has pages of lore that no one cares about.

It seems to borrow stuff from everywhere - multiple currencies and extra actions for exact payments from Alhambra, 8 build end condition from Ohne Furcht Und Adel, global goal condition from the Race From The Galaxy expansion. But they don't mesh as well as you'd like due to the chosen scaling of the game - we saw goals being completed by third turn, purely because those players were lucky enough to have the right contracts available on their turn, and lucky enough to draw the matching colour currency. The blind currency draw is obviously more luck-bound than Alhambra, plus the extra AP's a player can get is more significant to the result given the low number of turns in the game. All of which left a taste of why bother playing if my result seems so out of my control. There were some new elements, such as providing a free build to the next player in return for doing a card's special action. But perusing all the card's special effects increased downtime, often for no game-gain as they often weren't worth that cost. So it kind of wants to be in filler territory, but it's a touch long for that, which leaves the game in a state of playless limbo for me. It's definitely playable and fine, but just doesn't hit the right spot for mine.

This is a weird card game that seems to be offering a lot but actually delivers quite little.  The game is a bit susceptible to long downtime on turns and any game that has a community pile of cards that is liable to completely change by the time it gets back to your turn is going to be a bit frustrating in terms of mitigating luck.  The game appears to be striving to have some spatial element but comes up quite short.

Although the ruleset is fairly small, there is quite a lot going on in this game. It is not a fast card game. It's almost like a strategic board game being played with cards. No-one get's knocked out, and although there can be a bit of "take that" it's more of a "let me take that from you." :-)

I'm looking forward to playing a lot of this to explore the extent of different strategies that can be used.

This is alright, nothing special though. It felt very much like Alhambra to me, with special abilities on the tiles. It also felt extremely random, random currency draw, random tile draw.

Just played the PnP version, twice.  Played with wife and 8 y/o son.  They enjoyed the first game enough that they immediately asked to play again.  

Good game, theme fits, mechanics are very simple to grasp (2-3 turns and you got it).  Good amount of capability to strategize.  Good amount of player interaction.  Each turn you seem to be confronted with several good choices of actions.

We enjoyed the game and are glad we are kickstarter backers for this project.  Cannot wait to see the final product!

Just received our copy today, and already played our first game with the real product.  Even more fun than the pnp!  This is definitely our go to quick "city builder".  It plays fast, but it still offers some depth and both tactical and strategic decisions.  This is a well designed gem of a card game.

I was very lucky to have been one of the first play testers. The rules are well thought out even though it was only at the beta stage and accounts for most of the situations that we had encountered during the game play. Although it is very simple to pick up, it can be very challenging to play at the same time, depending on how you strategise each experience. This game has just the right balance of strategy and chance which I liked. Personally the theme would not have been my usual pick but the art and whole concept/aim stays true to the theme of the game and therefore believable which is a lot more important to me than the fact that there is no Cthulhu on the cards (come on, everyone loves the octopussy). This is my general feel for the game as of this stage. I would have liked to have given a more in- depth review of the game play but I only had the chance to play it twice so far. When I get my own copy I'll be able to review it a bit more thoroughly (come on Kickstarter!). I rated it a nine (not because I'm pretty awesome and won both times) because it is one of the rare games that I actually don't need to question my mood whether I am allowed to play it or not.

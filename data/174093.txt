Worth looking at for the kids. Build a maze, then race.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a creatively implemented "game".  The game's components are smartly done; using dense foam with a magnetic base to make the walls of the maze.    Game play consists of 2 parts - a maze building and then a swap and race.  The building part is good mental activity - but mostly a solitaire activity.  The race is moving a small wooden ball through your opponent's maze faster than she does moves through your's.  Again, it's solitaire.  The race brings in a dexterity aspect to game play.  Overall - it's more activity than game, but its enjoyable activity.

Very unique game, with lots of playability.  Why buy a paper puzzle book you do once and throw away, or a wooden box puzzle that you'll memorize and be bored with quickly.  Instead, you can have infinite variety with Maze Racers!  If you're looking for a great game to play as a family, this is it!

This game is really really neat. The race to outbuild a maze is stressful in the best sort of way. Then racing each other's mazes is a lot of fun. This is great with kids and adults alike. Beware it's really easy to lose the little red balls

A decent maze building/maze racing game for kids, but it did not really feel like the right game for adults.

Excellent game for kids.  My boys played at GenCon2016 and had a blast building the mazes, then racing.

RATING: 6
Very unique game that will likely appeal to most kids.  2 players each build a maze out of magnetic components then race to see who can finish the other player's maze first.  Great for spatial reasoning.  My 11 y.o. loves it.

This game is deceptively fun and addicting. I played it about 7 times at Gen Con and would love to play it more. 
This was the sleeper hit of the con.

Frantic maze making fun, with very tactile three-dimensional components. Off the charts as far as toy factor is concerned. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a super, well-executed implementation of the idea. So if you like that concept and have the space to store it, get it.
It's not much of a game, really, but then that's not the idea. It's fascinating to see how different ages and personalities go about building their mazes. We generally allow unlimited time for building the mazes, or else my child gets much more time than me, but it's also fun to try to finish yours in a flash and catch the other player out, too.
I should add that I very carefully cut the "punchboards" into identical sets of extra pieces, including a few corners and bumper-shaped pieces. The more variety the merrier.

The most fun I had at BFIG (along with Slideways). Super simple to play, but surprisingly challenging as you try to build the most complex maze for your opponent - especially if you hate to lose like me!

Very original game that is extremely fun to play. Who does not love mazes, and the best part is you get to make a maze for your opponent to navigate through. No better game for 'friendly' competitors.

A very cool game of building mazes that your opponent then has to go through. Seems like it'd be great for kids who love LEGOS, etc.

RATING: 5
I played what appeared to be the published version at BFIG 2015. The idea's delightful and the execution basically matches, except that my very clever (I told myself) maze was only marginally slower to solve than my opponent's much simpler one. Hopefully that just means I outsmarted myself, but I worry that maze construction doesn't actually matter too much.

Still, feels like a toy but with fully gamified rules for how to play with it. Thumbs up.

BRILLIANT! Played at Gen Con 2015 with my son -- we had a blast.  This is the perfect game -- easy to learn and endless replayability.  Bought it from Amazon as soon as we got home and I expect we will buy more as gifts for friends and family.  Also, the designer is a totally cool guy and deserves tons of support for this!  HUZZAH!

RATING: 9
The concept for this game sounds so goofy but it is truly a fun game. It gives off the vibe of being a toy but once you play it it becomes apparent that there is some strategy with building traps and such within your maze. The components are amazing and I have found myself returning to this game a lot.

RATING: 5
Build your labyrinth and let the other player run that through. Building the maze is much more fun than getting out of one. My kids love this game.

RATING: 6
Nice idea, but suffers a bit from the speed aspect as you are rather building your maze of hell than testing whether your opponent can move in there. Racing afterwards is still fun.

Lots of fun playing this.  However, adult vs child games aren't much fun due to the different skill levels.

Nekem nagyon tetszik az alapkoncepció, szuper lehetőségek vannak benne, ki lehet élni a kreativitást, újabb és újabb labirintusokat lehet tervezni. Minőségi a kivitelezés, jó érzés kézbe venni. Szerintem ez rendkívül fejlesztő játék. És talán ez is a gyengéje, hogy aki nem ügyes benne, az gyorsan szembesül is vele, mert a nem elég jó labirintusokat egyszerűen pikkpakk megoldja az ellenfél, és zsinórban veszíteni demoralizáló lehet. Az időkorláttal csak óvatosan, elég frusztráló tud lenni. Én szívesen játszom vele, de tipikusan az a játék, ami néha előkerül, többnyire viszont nem. Ráadásul az nagyon nem szimpatikus, hogy vannak haladó kezdőkártyák, amiket a honlapjukról kellene letölteni és kinyomtatni... Ööööööö, no comment.... No, de a játék nagyon jó, tényleg. :)

Played at Boston FIG.  I thought it would be a kids game (and it was definitely attracting the kids) but it was surprisingly challenging and super fun!  I definitely see how you could build a maze that is quite challenging.  Kinda kicking myself for not picking up a copy!

I played Maze Racers at Gen Con 2015. It was a lot of fun. It was very easy to pick up. I learned how to play the game in less than 5 minutes and had a very competitive match with another player. It's a great dexterity game for players of all ages that brings out lots of creativity when designing the maze.

Great for all ages! It's such a simple concept, but you're only limited by your imagination (and the available walls) for how complex you want your maze to be. Everyone we've played with loves it.

Only drawback is that we sometimes wish there were more curved walls or more variety in the types of walls. Other than that, this game is perfect.

This is a really unique game. Someone mentioned that it is great for a car ride and I can absolutely see that. Magnetic pieces help you build a maze and then your opponent races you through it.

Taught Julia how to play Maze Racers last night.  She enjoyed it.  She built a much prettier maze for sure.  My maze had lots of illusions and traps.  I enjoy the creative process of building a maze.  That is really fun.  And, trying to navigate the maze in competition is fun.  Can't wait to show this to family - it will be a hit. For the price point, quality of components, ease of learning, depth and strategy of the game, and fun, I think this is a 10.

Excellent, almost perfect game for young children. The kids sit there and build their mazes quietly, on their own. The race itself is a brief burst of competition that satisfies their competitive urges without leading to frustration or arguing. Can be taught in a couple of minutes, endlessly replayable, top-notch components.

This is a must game for anyone who likes mazes. It is great to see the creations that friends build the first time they play. Some freeze up with a complete blank slate and end up make a simple road, while others immediately get it, and create many traps and dead ends. The more you play the better your maze building skills become.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For such simple rules, this offers a light but creatively diverse experience. You're making a maze for others to solve, using a magnetic board and foam borders, and it works nicely for a quick experience. Seems like it'd be great for families - and easily expandable either with multiple copies or the advanced rules that offer different starting setups. This could work as a nice 2-player filler too.

Boston Festival of Indie Games 2015

----

I played Maze Racers at the Boston FIG... it was great fun and drew a large crowd of all ages. (In fact, it was the most fun game I played at FIG.)

It was more challenging than I initially thought to create a difficult maze. Watching others play I thought I could do a better job, but once I sat down and started putting pieces on the board it proved quite a challenge!

I'd want to experiment with different ideas and expect that it would take a lot of play time to learn how to create the best maze, meaning I'd continue to enjoy playing it many times. How to optimize... hmmmmm.

Bought this game on a whim after watching videos about it from GenCon 2015.  I definitely recommend it for children of pretty much all ages.  My 6 year old loves it and even went as far as to make "traps" in the  maze for the ball to get stuck in.  My 4 year old *wants* to play, but loses interest.  He does like the race part.  Your mileage with kids may vary, but there is nothing in the box that is too hard for children as young as 4 (reading, etc.)

The components are top quality.  The magnets stick and don't  move or shift at all in the race, but aren't so magnetic that pulling it off the board makes me fear the foam will separate from the magnet.  It's a quality game - and this comes from someone who has over 250 board games.  It folds together expertly too.

The game has great replayability as you can make a typical type maze (think a hedge-rows maze) or something as abstract as a pachinko game.  Build traps that are easy to get stuck in, but hard to get out - it's different every time.  With the included timer you can really start to stretch the game to making the building of the maze the "first race" and the actual ball racing is the "second race".

Absolutely recommend this game.

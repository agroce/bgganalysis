RATING: 9
Roughly a year after owning this game I'm re-doing my comments here raising my rating from 8.5 to 9 with the release of the series’ version 2 rules. Wing Leader Victories is now a robust, streamlined and comprehensive look at squadron-based air combat 1940-42. My rating reflects the game’s engine, art and thematic coverage—not gameplay. Version 2 rules and charts (downloadable or included with Wing Leader Supremacy) make Victories a finished and reliable product. Design uniqueness and dedication to efficacy set it apart from less polished games.

An innovative system that is surprisingly easy once you do a few battles. The rules are up to Lee B-W's high standards and are clear and easily understood. I haven't played the battles enough yet to determine if they are balanced but this could be due to understanding what works and what doesn't in the system.

The components are top notch, except for the map which is bland (but on the other hand how could you make it better?). the aircraft ADC's are of the same quality and thickness as Panzer's ADCs.

RATING: 9.2
Update: upped the score to 9.3. I played this game 35 times now and with the Conflict of Heroes series, this is the most played wargame by far.

It is as exciting as a year ago and I am slowly going through the scenarios again.

Marvellous system to play solo, playing both sides to the best we can. Easy to do because most scenarios are bomber-raids against interceptors.

---
The game is rather intruiging as it uses full squadrons and flights to simulate tactical air combat.

Learning curve is moderate (5-6/10) but quite logical.

It took me around 1-2 hours before playing my first scenario, a teaching solo fight. Sure looks great to design some air battles of my own too.

I only came to this game because it included the Fairey Battle plane and I designed 2 simple scenarios with it on the Vroenhoven bridges on May 11 1940 by the Belgian Air Force.

Then I discovered it included the Italian SM 79 too! That was my first Airfix plane I put together when I was 13 :) The fact these kind of planes were included shows that this is not your usual Me 109 vs Spitfire game

The game made a huge impression on me indeed. I will try to look for an integration with existent WW2 wargames and the game simply begs to create your own scenarios. I like the early War theme very much. But scenario 3 is so simple and fun (flying into Stalingrad with logistics). 

9..7/10 for solo play as it is defender against attacker in most scenarios.

RATING: 7.5
Good solo
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Initial rating based on four solos.

Beyond the great counters and aircraft cards, I am unfortunately experiencing so far only a very dry, procedural game, which requires lots of ergometrically jarring off board checking of the uniformly marker-intensive squadron displays, which must be checked repeatedly, squinting to see which squadron Letter matches which display row, who's got the Ace, who's got the Green crew, etc.    

Then, plenty of table look ups, ambiguously labelled column select/drm tables that do not clearly depict how/when these should be applied, and remembering to subtract the number of losses from each squadron/wing on those Cohesion checks, and don't forget -1 Low Ammo or -2 Depleted Ammo.  Oh, and don't forget, a hit's not really a hit until it's confirmed with a few more lookups and a few more die rolls, and a lot turn out to be misses or stragglers.  Hey, did you check your attack/defense vs. your little Sun marker and sun angle diagrams?  Don't forget that either.  Which yields...results?  After 2-3 turns of combat, almost everyone is Disrupted or Broken, and headed home.   Strategy?  Get your planes in the enemy box as fast as possible, hope for really high dice rolls on the few shots you'll get before the ammo runs out (otherwise you won't score much), and your guys get Broken and are forced to go home.  

Accurate?  Admirably so!  -- given my reading to date.  Fun?  No.  After all the looking and look ups and dice and counter fiddling, each turn and at the end it all feels and looks like a mess.  (An accurate depiction of aerial combat chaos, I guess).  But the continual 18 inch side glances and reaches to displays, marker fiddling, and unit piling yields an equally accurate assessment of disappointment and lack of fun or excitement.  Just tedious, dreary admin, in a system that could rank with some of Berg's '80s and '90s Fiddliness messes.  Not clicking for me so far.

Solo' a couple scenarios to get the hang of it; like all of his games, Wing Leader is a ton of work for not much actual game. The tallying and movement rules are clever, the side-on approach is really good, and the physical design of the game is excellent (at least until you inevitably get 12 counters crammed into one space). But the rules load and time commitment for such a limited payoff in player engagement honestly makes this a hard game to like.
---
Intrigued by this one, but wow, that's a long rulebook. Taking a wait-and-see approach now. I think I always want to like Brimmicombe-Wood's games more than I actually do; Bomber Command really has been the only keeper. Earlier games are just so complicated for a fairly limited payoff.

RATING: 5.5
I'm finding the rules a real problem. They are staggeringly un-informative. Fortunately Elias Nordling's review in Battles 11 has begun to get me seeing why I am having this significant level of rule blindness. However, as I have to read and absorb the rules for the group with which I play it may deny us the opportunity to play this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The concept of this game is very cool. I really enjoy the early maneuvering. One thing I don't care for is that you get stuck in combat piles. Weather or not you choose to dog fight, you can't leave a square with an enemy you've tallied. So, as far as I can tell, you can't strategically retreat, which really ruins the funnest part (that being the maneuvering). The combat itself is mostly just a procedure without choices, what matters is how you enter combat, and the existing state of your planes. So once you're stuck in combat it's just repeated, long, and almost choiceless procedure until you or your opponent breaks.

RATING: 7
Very beautiful game.
The game consider many interesting elements of the airwar in WW2.
Fan of air War and pilot, I'm a little disappointed. 
The datas that differentiate aircraft are not precise enough. Aircraft of different values are then similar. (Example P-51) The art of pilots is precisely to take advantage of these small differences. (Eg the "hit and run" of the P-40 pilots against Zeke's, how to do it?)
During the game you have to make only few decisions... You are only a spectator of a beautiful dogfight regulated by dices.
For me, it's not the ultimate game to simulate the air war. But maybe it's impossible on a table.

I wish I love WL, but mixed feelings at last... 
Rating after playing 5 sessions on 3 scenarios.  
Pros: great idea, beautiful artwork, historical accuracy, replayability, perfect toolbox for personal creation, easy to learn (with video tutorial) and solo friendly => I was very excited at box opening ! 
Cons: too generic, a little too abstract, some reserves about the scale/movement/facing, lack of decisions during play => I felt bored after those few sessions
I prefer stop playing it at the time being. Will go for another attempt in few months to check if this judgment is transient or final.

While the game may reproduce historic outcomes, having squadrons become ineffective after a few passes with or without kills turns out to be less fun than I'd hope. On the other hand the components are beautiful and the historic aircraft profiles on the counters are cool to look at. We'll see if my attitude changes with more plays

[b]Wing Leader: Victories 1940-1942

An Innovative, Playable And Entertaining Tactical Game On Air Combat[/b]

An unusual side-view representation of tactical, or rather grand-tactical, WWII Air Combat. The graphical representation and components are outstanding. While the rules are lengthy with 48 pages, the game is not a complex one, its confusing nature more a consequence of its novelty/innovation. The system leaves you wondering at first how much decision making is actually involved, and this is the games greatest flaw, yet its most rewarding factor when pushing through. Ultimately, the decision making process is coequal with your experience. This has more of a chess-feeling to it than I would want to admit to myself, but at the same time I enjoy it for exactly this reason. Everything is a matter of positioning, gaining the point of vantage. When the squadrons enter combat, you cannot do much. This can be highly frustrating for newcomers, but is most rewarding for experienced players.

From a non hardcore wargamer: After learning a painful lot of rules with tons of exeptions without even touching the advanced chapters, I played the first two scenarios. What can I say... there seem to be very few real devisions to make. It doesnt evoke the feeling of participating in air battles, it rather feels like you're beeing played by a game, that needs you to check tables and to make rolls and place markers. It that sense it is probably very realistic (how could air war work with dozends and dozends plaines, when the pilots could do whatever they want), but the level of abstraction (i.e. dogfights are only represented by a marker and procedures, not actual piloting decisions) makes it boring. You are resolving rather then playing. Thats maybe also true for other wargames, but terrain and bigger freedom of movement gives you more sense of control. Maybe this would change with more complex scenarios, but I'll pobably not bother.

A really neat take on air combat that tries to capture procedures and mission aspect.

RATING: 9.5
A design that concentrates on appropriate-level decision making. You don't command your wings by aggregating the movement of individual aircraft. You decide where and when to commit your forces. How long your planes last in combat before they head for home is a bit of a crap-shoot, as it was historically. You - the wing leader - can maximise your odds by gaining good position. Yet a veteran flight/squadron might be quickly blown, green flyers might stubbornly hang on. Brilliant design, and one that plays quickly. If your thing is controlling individual aircraft then this probably isn't the game for you, but for me it's the best tactical air game out there.

This is the game I would have dreamed of when I was 12 had I been able to imagine it, but 40 years later it still greatly impresses the older me. As usual from LBW, it's graphically spectacular but also a very clever and original design, with a real historical tale to tell. As with Nightfighter, this should be be a good game to teach to offspring and other new wargamers. If that pans out, I'll have to raise my rating to 11.

I can't believe I haven't already commented on this as is really deserves as much praise as possible. A highly novel (with the side view) and very realistic simulation of tactical WWII air combat. The rule book is large around 50 odd pages but very logically set out and the game plays much simpler once you get a hang of the rules. Saying that it does take a few plays for the rules to become ingrained but once you've gotten into the swing of things you're set and the game positively rollicks along. I just today played my first game in around 5 months and I found that I was back in the saddle within about 5 or 10 minutes of playing. The scenario book is also arranged that more and more detail is added as you play through the scenarios.

I really don't think any boardgame thus far has come this close to giving such a realistic feeling of tactical level WWII air combat and also being exceptionally quick and easy to play and highly exciting and enjoyable at the same time. Combined with Wing Leader Supremacy it gives a fantastic feel for the technological progress which occurred during the war and there is just so much variety with the scenarios and the aircraft that the game has endless replay value. This is a downright fantastic game series with beautiful components and is an absolute must for any gamer with an interest in the air war in WWII. Bloody marvellous!

This is a amazingly inspired game.  It takes Mike Spick's use of the vertical (which I thought was interesting in the 1980's) and integrates it key features like communications  (CGI. radio nets), the relative importance of speed over maneuverability, and engine performance vs. altitude  - and portrays WWII air combat in a revolutionary - and I say highly realistic, digestible and fun game.  It also models what Clausewitz would the moral effects - training and leadership.  "Its the man -not the machine" - you see that clearly in this game.  Combat results make sense in a way they do not in  most other WWII tactical air games.  The rules have some issues and the map gets cluttered - but this is the future IMHO - the Sistine Chapel of WWII air games. Can't wait for Volume 2.

RATING: 5
02/06/16 Played scenarios 1 & 2. 
My impression of Wing Leader somewhat schizophrenic. That is, if I had to run the game it would have worn my brain to a frazzle. But if someone else is doing that, then its not that big of a strain. I only played the two easiest scenarios. And even then the second one became quite cluttered with planes and markers all in one square, in spite of the separate display sheet for the squadrons. To me this is basically the type of game I used to play back in the 1980s, in that games of that day often had scads of charts and tables to consult which generated a great many heavily modified die rolls every single turn. Well, I was a lot younger in the 80s, and thought all wargames were "just that way" and nothing could be done about it if one wanted any semblance of accuracy. Today I have a very low tolerance for all that clap trap. I am not a calculator. And in the last 25+ years I've played many better designed (that is, streamlined) games. So for that reason, and assuming I wasn't the poor sucker who had to run the game I'd rate Wing Leader a "6". Yet if I had to run the game I'd call it a "4". So I'm going to split the difference and call it a "5". I'd play it again (as long as some other smuck has to run the game), but I'd never ask for it.  
Two final thoughts. 1. All that complexity, yet fuel is never taken into account?  2. Why does just about every GMT game have endless charts/tables and DRMs? How about entering the 21st century of game design? For your goal seems to be "how much can we make the player's brain burn?"   

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Edit: have played the first three scenarios multiple times, giving this a tentative 8. Reading the advanced rules now so I can try some of the more involved scenarios. I think this is the first design that I have played that really works at this scale. (Basically squadron level tactical combat) Takes a while to understand all the consequences of the interactions of the various systems, but it's not really that heavy, rules wise. It is also one of the most graphically pleasing air games ever made. It is quite striking when it is on the table. I'm already looking forward to vol 2. 

Just received, have read most of the rules, no plays yet. Innovative squadron level air combat game. The counters and aircraft cards (which are beautiful, and not cards, really, but tiles, as you'll see in some euro games) are a visual feast, with the aircraft counters featuring theater or unit specific colors. will be playing very soon, maybe tonight. 

One thing -- the rules aren't as intimidating as they look by the page count. They are written basically on one half of each page, with the other half of the page being sidebars - examples, comments, etc, and a rule every now and then. The actual volume of rules in the rulebook is about half of what the page count indicates. Without actually playing yet (but having set up a scenario while going over the rules), the rules are well written and tight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A very interesting system for large scale air battles that features beautiful components and almost two dozen scenarios.  The system is pretty easy to figure out and after a few plays you can almost skip the sequence of play.  Although not a game for rivet counters or those interested in plane on plane combat/technical discussions, there are a large number of decisions each turn about how to use the squadrons and flights of aircraft under your control.  It's also one of those games where you can set the game up, play for a few hours, then because of bad die rolls, circumstances, etc., nothing happens!  Some gamers may or may not like that aspect.

Wow, this was FUN to play!  Kept moving ata cracking pace, and no fiddling with relative positions on an area grid or something.  Planes different enough to be interesting, lots of wild fate.

Easily playable in one sitting.  Scenario's reveal historical insights about tactics and the practical realities of the era.

I've played 4 scenarios in quick succession. The rules are not hard, just different from any other game on air warfare I've played, but then no other game I've played tried to do what this one does. Doesn't hurt that it looks gorgeous on the table, LBW hit it out of the park with the artwork!

Looking at the airplane ratings and charts, you may think that everything looks kind of same-ish, but you would be wrong. The differences, though small in appearance, definitely show once the lead starts flying.

I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, fun, but still serious game on WWII air warfare. Volume II and expansions can't come soon enough!

Just got this last weekend even though I have struggled with this designer's rulebooks in the past (my issue, not his, I suspect). I'm hoping either Marco or Enrico do a video review of this game to help with the learning curve (even though it doesn't appear to be too difficult). 

Update: I am certain it is my fault and not the designer's that I struggle with his rules but I sold this one because I was never certain I was playing the game correctly. For what it is worth, I get the same feeling from rule books written by Don Greenwood as well. I'm sure it is a splendid game with a ton of historical insight and, perhaps, with repeated play the rules would have clicked but I moved on.

LBW does it again. His historical research shows. The side view (abstracting out a lateral dimension to show the more important vertical dimension) is a good bit of thinking outside the box.

The game is easy and quick to play once you've gone through a few turns. (Some scenarios only last a few turns.) The ergonomics are good. All the information for each air unit is tracked on an off-map display with markers; no written records. There are few enough units in play that this works well.

I've been playing the scenarios solitaire multiple times to experiment with different tactics.

Squadron level grand tactical.  Very different look at WWII air combat.  Ammo depletion, and cohesion really show transitory nature of aerial attacks.

Beautiful game. Awesome rule book. Extremely thematic and historical feel to the play. My number one recommendation for an air game. Frankly, my number one tactical game period.

Really the best flying game I have played in years. it does not get bogged down in minutiae. Quick playing with a good rule set. Haven't had this much fun with an air game since the Avalon Hill days

A very fun and playable title by LBW.  Excellent components, and works well solo too.

Innovative and fun tactical air combat.  Rules divided into "basic" and "advanced" sections permitting the opportunity to learn them in stages.  Rules book laid out well with plenty of example illustrations.  Not difficult to learn the rules.  Scenario #1 (AVG P-40s vs. Japanese Ki-21 bombers) is solo and designed as an opportunity to apply the basic air combat rules.

Just lovely! My game of the year for 2015 (yes, I like it even more than Enemy Action Ardennes) - I want to have its babies, too.

Excellent game - looks fantastic from the side views.

Playing quite a bit now.  There are a lot of nuances here involved with the decisions.... Climb?  Attack? Split?  Concentrate?  Tally? React? Bounce?

A nice change of pace from the usual games I play.  Took me a little longer to get the hang of it than I thought it would but it is a very unique and fun take on the air war of WWII.

Beautiful Looking Game,  GMT really outdid themselves this time around.   Cannot wait to try playing this,  excited to see what vol. 2 will include.  Will update after I play.  Very fun to play when you dont' need 4-5 hour game or scenario.  WL scenarios all vary but so far I have found them to be less than 2 hours or shorter and very fun to play a real winner of a game.

Probably my favourite "dudes on a map game". It's got all the manoeuvring and shooting you could want, but without the silly exceptions, terrain affects, and squad cohesion bollocks.

Interesting side-on approach to dogfighting. Takes a bit of getting used to but it works.

Caveat - I was involved in the production of this game. Having said that, I didn't get to play it until I got hold of a copy from GMT, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I've had several sessions playing with local friends, and each time we've managed to get 3 or 4 scenarios played over about 5 hours, and that included time to teach my opponent the rules. So it's fast playing, gives believable results, is easy to learn, and looks good (but I'm biased on that).

Very attractive counters, bland map. I'm a big fan of LBW air war games but this one doesn't do it for me. Novel concept that introduces the vsual dimension that is missing from most air war games. Played number of scenarios but it just didn't grip me in the same way as Nightfighter or the Burning Blue does.

Update: trying a VASSAL game with one of the playtesters. Rating may improve in the near future. Watch this space. Enjoying the system more than I did. Rating up to 7.

I keep reading enthusiastic and well-argumented comments, yet, I am not sold...

But it is LBW, so it *must* be good, right?

Super fun. Though a bit pricey. I have been involved in both of the Kickstarter projects for this game and do not regret a bit of it. My whole family loves playing. And it's super easy to convince others to join in. There is a bit of a learning curve due to the massive amount of iconography. But do not let that be a barrier to fun!

Not to be confused with Dungeon Roll by Tasty Minstrel which I had played two weeks ago. This one seems more fiddly than the first game of the same name I played about two weeks ago. This one feels more like a RPG with its options for players and less like a dungeon crawl. Neither game is really for me.

Kickstarted this one based on all the hype and amazing looking dice.  Totally random and the rules are atrocious.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is quite awesome, it has a ton of rules but after a couple playthroughs you will have most of them mastered. I have all the existing expansions and recommend them all, just add one at a time so you get used to new rules. Like Munchkin you can help other players and play against them (although less significantly against them). Played with 3, 4, 5, and 6 players and worked fine in all of those, we had at least 3 players competing for the last fame in the last round so i would say it is very luck driven but amazingly balanced as well. 

A definite must if you like dice, and this game definitely has a ton of nice dice.

Could have been so much better than it was with a team behind it that cared as much about putting effort into the rulebook as they did about funding custom molded dice.  Nearly unplayable for as much time as you have to spend cross referencing what should be SIMPLE!

NEW: Lowering my score here as I make the sad realization that this is Munchkin with dice. That's not exactly true, but it's pretty close. It is still a fun game, but I have games that do the help/hinder from other players thing better.

OLD: I finally gave this game a try and my first impression is that the rules are a bit hard to follow. I made many mistakes. But, even with the mistakes and all the referencing the manual, I found the game very fun, which is a good sign, in my opinion. For now, it's a solid 8. That score may go up as I incorporate more expansion content to my plays and learn the rules better.

RATING: N/A
I Like this one enough that I am glad to have another expansion on the way, as much as they can be, this dice game has some teeth and a decent amount of replayability for me. So far it has been brutal tough and it takes an intrepid group of gamers to gain traction enough for everyone to be able to hold their own and make some headway to some truly interesting situations. I will not score it yet, I want some plays with the expansion I have already, but I can easily say this is one of my "keeper" Kick starters.

Fun dice combat game, can play really quick. The dice are very high quality and feel good to roll. The rules are pretty simple, but it does take multiple plays to remember all the ability icons. Im looking forward to more dice in the upcoming expansion!

One thing about this game is that the diplomacy part of the game is not for every group of gamers and I can see the potential for more than a few game groups getting mad at each other and the game if they are not really friends and do cut throat diplomacy. On the flip side, that can be a draw for some people too.

House Rule:
After a bunch of playing, I found it to be more fun to go to 6 fame instead of 4. That way you have more opportunity to battle stronger monsters and have more advanced equipment.

[b]Kickstarter 2015/2016/2017[/b] 
This is a fun and quick dice/dungeon crawl game.  You draw dice from different bags to defeat monsters (with different abilities), collect equipment and potions, and try to win with four points.  Points are awarded for different high end monsters (trophies), artifact dice, and reaching the highest level.

We do not like how the artifacts are worth a point each.  They're extremely powerful, but usually by the time you get one, you cannot use it because you just won.  Also, you could be really lucky and essentially collect artifacts and win that way without collecting a trophy monster.  A lot of it has to do with the luck of the draw and the luck of the roll.  However, even with the down sides, I still think it is a great game with BEAUTIFUL dice.  I really appreciate how quickly you can play a game.

[b]Expansions owned:[/b]
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/158227/dungeon-dice-guilds][i]Guilds[/i][/geekurl] - These add some interesting twists to the game.  The guilds require being equipped with certain equipment before being able to use the guild dice.  Each guild gives a potential power (before, during, or after roll).  It is an interesting addition to the game.  It also encourages us of different equipment that might not otherwise been used, and also encourages negotiating with the other players to trade dice.

If it comes up with their symbol you can use their ability.  However, they do have a "flee" symbol which puts it back into the bag.  It works.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/159622/dungeon-dice-monster-pack][i]Monster Pack[/i][/geekurl] - More monsters + new abilities = more fun!

RATING: 7
The game seems to be and could be awesome. However, the rules are somewhat not refined. The random initial draw is not a good idea, all the monsters (regardless of level/reward) shouldn't be mixed up as this takes away enjoyment. But regardless of some occasions where you are unlucky, this game is very funny and satisfactory.

RATING: 9
A great quick dice rolling RPG. The base game is plenty of fun on its own, but gets significantly more depth with the expansions. This is one of my top games and I highly recommend it. The quality of the dice is amazing. The closest comparison I can make to another better known game is to Munchkin, but I have had much more fun and better player interaction with Dungeon Dice.

(Rating after one play)

Played it as a 2-player game and it wasn't fun at all. A big part of the game is choosing a teammate to gang up on a monster, but if you only have one option, what's the point? It's not a cooperative game after all... 

The rules are unclear on a few things as well, but there are FAQs online.

Will have to try it out with 3 and 4 players.

This is pretty light fare, but the negotiation element elevates this from a simple "roll high to win" game to something that is genuinely fun to play.  The rules are good but some things are hard to find and you'll want to find the FAQ to resolve some timing issues.  But honestly, this isn't a rules lawyer game so just wing it if anything comes up.

This is a real grower. The first couple of games are a bit "well whatever". The fun of this game comes later when everyone understands how to play and the bribing for co-operation and sabotaging starts to happen. The expansions also add a lot to the game.

Dungeon Dice is an all-dice game and challenges the all-dice market with its heavy focus on deep layered strategy and accessible humor. There's plenty of heart under the surface to boot! It's not only fun to collect, but having the complete set has been one of the added benefits. My dice collection usually sits around so it's fun to be able to crank these out and really get them used. While games with two players are still fun, the game's at its best when adventuring with four players. The negotiation options get a bit heated, especially when there are artifact dice on the line. When the expansions come into play, there are even more options to take your Dice game to the next level. Every bag has the color-coded clearly marked and the guide provides excellent reference for all of the symbols. If you're a fan of games like Munchkin and games with a lot dice, then Dungeon Dice is for you. I highly recommend getting in on this growing franchise!

This one did not go over well, and the rules didn't exactly help. It was ok, and I liked the concept, but it wasn't very dynamic with two players. This isn't the cheapest game, but wow do you get a lot of dice! Maybe the game is better now that there are expansions?

I suspected this was a poorly-designed game but thought the fun of rolling lots of different dice would be worth it.

In fact the design flaws get in the way of enjoying how many dice there are. And the rolling is rarely as high-stakes as picking dice out of the bag in the first place (which would also be fun, if the game were fun). The "ask for assistance" mechanics are dumb and lead to even more lopsided battles. The "first to 4" scoring is anticlimactic (though the game is already too long). The interactions among all the abilities aren't interesting or unusual. Or well-specified in the rules.

But I can imagine people being able to get past that and have fun, so it does get a 3. I just will be astonished if I'm ever one of those people.

Redeeming factor: They noticed and proactively offered refunds when the "deluxe bags" they sold in the Kickstarter turned out to fray too easily.

Main downsides are a slight learning curve for so many die abilities, and having to reference several different rulebooks to figure things out. Those issues are getting addressed in a comprehensive rulebook coming out with the second edition.

Played at STG Con.  Learned it from a demonstrator and it was fairly simple and intuitive in that context.  I can't help thinking if I was trying to learn the game myself it would be a nightmare of looking up different icons and figuring out how their interactions are supposed to work.

Didn't really care for the mouse pad player mats.  Art in general is a little on the weak side.

Just not that fun really.  A game called "Dungeon Dice" needs to have some adventure and excitement.   This was more adding and counting than anything else.

Another KS success story.

This has gone over extremely well with the family, thus far.

I am hesitant to rate it yet, because I want to see if my excitement and the whole newness factor are clouding my judgment.

The only knock, that I see, really...is the utter randomness, which is to be expected in dice games.

I went ~ 3 turns in our last game picking/rolling impossible monsters, and my turns were all FLEES. Oh well...no biggie, but that's the only real down-side.

So much fun hoisting a handful of Her/Equipment Dice onto the table...and those Artifacts..ooohhhhh....

More please!!!

Ok, I broke down and rated it...for now  :)  We are having so much fun with this one. There are so many varieties of how your character can be built and yet we still find ourselves wanting MORE dice!!!  More weapons, especially Artifacts! More spells!  More everything!
It's a ton of fun. get through the iconography and the rules set...it's well worth it!

Dungeon Dice is a competitive, all-dice game with a classic adventuring feel in which players battle monsters and try to collect more dice than their friends. Players equip dice, drink dice potions, and kill dice monsters. If you've killed enough monsters, grab a level-up die. You get the idea.

Fun, light dice roller with lots of player interaction. In the vein of Cutthroat Caverns..but with dice.

Also, for the price of the game, you get PILES of dice. Well worth the $$!

An excellent dice-rolling game.  This is one of the better 'dungeon rolling' games I have ever played.  The components are beautiful, and the game flows easily.  I will be picking up all the expansions for this based on the play value of the base game.  Do not pass it up.

An inordinate number of symbols, flat, repetitive gameplay, very little drama, no point in continuing to cooperate past level six, too easy to gain levels, some of the magic dice had markings on all faces which I found ridiculous...  No, this one did not work at all for me.  And I like dice and dice games, and randomness does not bother me.

I know there are a lot of teachers on BGG so I wanted to share this...

I teach 4-8th grade and have shared this game with all my classes. It's incredible to me how much appeal this game has to a wide variety of ages. I use games as part of a reward system in my class and this one has been, by far, the most successful. 

Personally I like to see the kids using their reasoning skills as well as shifting between being competitors one moment and then helping one another in the next. I believe there is enormous value in playing games that are fun even if you don't win.

I have 4th grade girls who LOVE this game as well as 8th grade boys! Very wide appeal...highly recommend it for the classroom (and home too!).

I saw a few bad ratings and I had to put my 2 cents in.  

This is a very fun and fast pace game with a lot of expandability. 

It is very easy to play and learn.  All you need is the icon quick reference sheet that you can find in the file section.  Thank you for making it, Skaak.  I was going to but you already did.  

Game should take about 10-15 minutes once you know the game.

I did the print and play version from the cancelled/failed Kickstarter and have played it a few times. The game seems really random and a bit simplistic. While I've never purchased the "real" game, I have played it at a few cons and went to a demo of it. I didn't really see the improvements needed to entice me to buy a real set of the dice. I have enjoyed playing a few games of this on occasion, but the last few games we played, we went all the way around the table of 5 players four times without a single monster being defeated, even when help was given. That's not a common occurrence, but you usually just end up playing something else.

HOWEVER, the dice from the game do look really nice, and we've used the print and play versions in some of our own made up games. I've occasionally thought about buying a set because of that rather than for the Dungeon Dice game itself.

If a luck based game of throwing dice with minor level up elements is your kind thing, then I'd suggest giving this a try. Still, I suggest you find a way to try before you buy (like at BGG Con!).

At first blush, this game seems to have the strategy of Zombie Dice (draw the right dice from the bag without any choice), the strategic arc of Munchkin (the early game is irrelevant and everyone cooperates, then the late game is a luck fest that is all that matter), and the rulebook organization of Dragon Dice (lots of icons with multiple layers of indirection across various poorly formalized rulebooks).  That is to say, the game is a disaster.

The base game is straight forward, and the rulebook is fine, but the game had no substance.  The expansions might add a little substance, but they turn it into a steaming mess of icons and rules that are poorly written, heavily cross-referenced, and ambiguous in many situations.  They are a disaster trying to fix a bad game by adding more bad stuff.

The dice are nice at least...which is all I really expected when I backed the KS.  So, I do not regret my purchase despite hating the game.

another note:  I will credit the designer for reading criticism on BGG and producing additional materials to help address them, such as clearer skill summaries and cleaned up rules.  He is quite dedicated and professional, and I will give future games of his a try despite my opinion of this one.

update:  I designed a revision of the game (+ all expansions) that, for me, raises the game to a 6/10 by offering some choices, less playtime, and less variance.  It can also be run solo.  Will eventually post it to variants.

Pros:
- Easy Setup
- Nothing like rolling tons of dice!
- While it is luck driven (obviously, it's a dice game) there is all kinds of strategy in the weapons/items you pick and using what you roll to turn a bad situation into a good one.
- Game creators are putting up new expansions pretty much every year.
- Game creators are very active on BGG and they get user feedback and suggestions when picking new types of monsters and elements to add to the game.
- Very large and active community of players on BGG that not only have created supplemental content (instructions, player cards, etc) but also come up with their own variants and home-brewed ideas for dice to add to the game.

Cons:
- There are A LOT of icons to learn and the list keeps getting larger with each expansion.  Be prepared to look up icons often.  This is tempered by users creating a document that shows the order of effects and icon look-ups so it isn't too bad once you have those.

Not balanced at all. Success during game entirely dependent on monster draws. As each monster is represented by one die, and only a handful can be completed at base level, it means many many turns are spent running away.

Once the players are comfortable with interpreting the Dice Symbols and how to apply them in combat situations, both the speed and enjoyment increases.  Plays very well with 2 but think there will be a much more exciting experience with 3 or more as Trades, Assisting in Combat, and using dice with a negative effect against the active player will make much more sense then.  The game does rely heavily on Luck, as repeated poor dice rolls can leave a player feeling like they are not even part of the game.  There is some strategy however; deciding when to push your luck, how to best utilize your dice, and what kind of safety margin you want to have when you are deciding how many dice you should roll against a specific Monster in the Dungeon.  The game can run longer than expected or be over rather quickly depending on the rolls and luck in blindly choosing monsters, spells, equipment, and artifacts from their respective bags.  Kids, non-gamers, and light hearted or casual gamers will enjoy this, but the luck element may put off true Tactical Strategy aficionados.

PnP is great.  I'm a backer too.  Well designed, simple, enjoyable game. Edit - just received actual game and it's awesome - the actual game looks so much better in person. Edit - With multiple expansions, the game is even better. Increased to 10 stars.  Great game with 3-6 players.

Includes the thief mini expansion, the kickstarter exclusive expansion and the guilds expansion. I love the quality of the dice and the idea of the game play. Only played the base game so far, but really liked it. The cluttered manual is allivated a bit by the available references on BGG. Rules are quite easy to get, at least with the base game parts, and turns are quick. I like that the game really gives you reasons for haggling, as that spices up the game a ton and elevates it from a simple rolling off game to something much more social. Great pub game, as the components are near indestructable.

One of my very favorite and most played games, despite some serious issues with the rules and design. I've played Dungeon Dice more than 100 times over the last 2 years and always enjoy it.

Dungeon Dice is like Munchkin, only without the cloying humor and with somewhat less backstabbing. And it's all dice. That's a good place to be - it sets up almost instantly and you can bang out a game in about 10 minutes per player once you know the rules. It's light, appropriate for casual play, but there are still plenty of decisions to make to try and slant the odds in your favor. I've played with kids, adults, teens, gamers, and non-gamers, and everyone's enjoyed it. The negotiation element makes the game a lot more interesting and fun - while I occasionally play a quick 2p match with my son, it's significantly better with 3+ players.

However, the rules and underlying design are a significant problem. 95% of the game's design is very clever and tight, but the rules are so poorly written and organized that they often fail to communicate that design. There are also some design choices (that remaining 5%) that are counter-intuitive or that add significant rules baggage for an insignificant effect. The designer is a super-nice guy and very active answering questions, and I appreciate that, but he can't seem to grasp how other people are going to read his rules. And despite how much I love the game, I feel there are fundamental design flaws that will never be remedied by any number of FAQ's or rules rewrites, and these flaws become more pronounced the more you add onto the base game. That the game is [i]still[/i] so much fun is a testament to the designer's creativity and intuition. But there will be some rules-lawyer-heavy groups for which this game will produce more conflict than enjoyment.

With two expansions and a selection of add-on packs available, there's also a real question of what bits to play with. I would certainly recommend starting out with just the base game first. It's lots of fun by itself and was all I had for a year before my Guilds package arrived. I'd argue the design of the monsters and abilities in the base game is tighter as well. The expansions and supplements [i]do[/i] add significantly to the experience. But the base game by itself is completely enjoyable, so much so that I have an additional set of just the base game (OK... plus the Familiars) for times when the fast-and-light Dungeon Dice experience is exactly what I want.

Great looking game, plays quick, end is a little anti climatic, and you can really be set back with a frustrating initial weapon draw.  Needs an expansion to flesh out the end game, and I think it could use a standard Item set to start with, maybe use a drafting mechanic out of what should be available starting items.
Overall Great game,glad i backed it on Kickstarter. Look forward to the expansion.

Quite a bit to work with in this game.  It almost requires you to work with others at the beginning due to the random nature of pulling a die out of the bag.

backed this on kickstarter - tons of custom dice, how can you skip this one. First reviews of PnP version also look positive so looks there's gonna be a game there, not just dice. Update: there is a game! Without single miniature or tile this game manages to give you a feeling of exploring dungeon, fighting monsters, unlocking chests looking for treasures.Your hero's level-up is also here - all in less time than it might take to setup any "traditional" dungeon crawler.

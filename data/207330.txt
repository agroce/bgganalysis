RATING: 7
I found this game to be rather solid with a reasonable playing time. Rules are quite straightforward and intuitive. On your turn you choose an action (preferably you benefit more from it than your opponents do) to either collect resources or to construct buildings. There is only one type of resource (marble), three types of basic buildings (hut, square, palace) and two types of special buildings (statue, temple). Basic buildings give you an access to marble and victory points while the special buildings are the source of victory points (you need to have your own city built next to them). That is all. Simple and straightforward, but still offers meaningful decisions. Moreover Hellas plays fast. 

Not spectacular but I like.

That's not a thematic game. Apart from the pillars of the temples it has nothing to do with "Hellas". Nevertheless a nice abstract game with a short playing time.

This one is not really grabbing me and accordingly I'm finding the rules a bit fiddly even though they are not complicated.  Playing it online on Yucata so there is time between turns for me to have forgotten how the games works again so maybe I should try and give this one a whirl face-to-face.

Heel eenvoudig qua regels.  10+ staat erop, maar ik denk dat een 8-jarige de spelregels ook onder de knie kan krijgen.  Natuurlijk wordt er ook wel gepest...

Je bouwt dorpjes rond marmermijnen, en mijnt.. De mijnen verouderen en sluiten na een tijdje.  Je bouwt een stad door er een paleis in te zetten.  Je kan toegangswegen voor anderen afsluiten.
Aandacht voor het standbeeld !!
Heel eenvoudig, toch quasi geen geluk.  Enkel KT strategie mogelijk, want er verandert te veel op het spelbord om veel vooruit te plannen.

The depth to complexity/playing time ratio is excellent. The game takes you back in time to where simplicity and elegance where the norm. There is nothing incredibly innovative about the game, but what it does it does well. Player interaction, a spatial element and meaningful decisions in a quick playtime; what's not to like.

Solid game for sure, but I fear it will be forgotten in a year.  The aging query mechanism is really neat, but the single resource economy and basic area majority end up making for an "ok" game.  Wouldnt mind playing again, but don't need to own a copy since the size of the box is way to big for the content (Ticket to ride size box).

RATING: 6.5
This game reminds me of many things I have played before but I can't think of a clear comparison. Here's stretching it: It's like Terra Mystica without all the convoluted rules. Or... Through the Desert with added rules. That more or less indicates weight of the game I guess.

So, not too heavy, filler-like play time. I like the action choosing/worker placement part. There are actions just for you, or shared by all players. It's all about blocking routes, connecting temples, reaching mines, and building the biggest city on a hexagon map. There's some luck involved in how productive a mine you're adjacent to can be. A lucrative spot near a productive mine can be a dead end in a heartbeat. Even if you spread your chances the luck of the draw can really have an impact for more than one round.

To my surpise it even has a challenging dexerity involved minigame; Placing the temple pillars exactly on their spot without making the temple a ruin. It's like dominoes with toothpicks.

Not totally sure on this one yet. It feels like the game should of come out about 10 years ago. It’s got a little Puerto Rico action selection with quarry mining. I like the action selection mechanic but the rest of game seems a little dull. I still want to explore more. It plays in under 60 min.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Some nice basic hex-claiming and resource-generating, with a mechanic that keeps you from counting on any one source of income as quarries get worn out with time - maybe next turn, maybe this one!  Unfortunately, the turn-order mechanics feel a little herky-jerky, so it never really feels all that smooth, and apart from the little fluted columns (which are dangerously easy to lose in the carpet) the art and bits all feel a little generic.

Valahogy így kell játékot tervezni. Egyszerű szabályok, kevesebb, mint egy órás játékmenet, mégis komoly döntések, komoly interakció. Az interakció ráadásul csak kis részben kitolós, nagyobb részben agyalós, "nehogy a másiknak többet kedvezzek" fajta.
Kevés játék van, ami ennyi szabállyal, ilyen játékidővel ilyen mélységet nyújt.

Dorra does the classic euro perfectly. Low entry investment with great interaction, meaningful decisions, and quick game play. 

I am also a fan of the small twists Dorra builds into his games that bring what should be standard fare  and makes his designs brilliant.  

Dorra is no saint.  He will force your hand to make plays that hurt others' plans.  I personally love this about his games, and Hellas has it in bundles.  

Dora's games are distinct because they have a personality, unlike so many other games out there his have a real signature.

In this day and age of point and mechanic salads, it's refreshing to see a good old-school Euro that manages to have a decent amount of strategy with elegance and simplicity. The players use a single resource type to build temples and statues, as well their own cities, made of houses, palaces and plazas. Everything is scored at the end of the game, with points for each player's biggest city and adjacency to neutral buildings.

The action-selection system, with everyone being able to perform the selected action or benefit from it most of the time and no obvious bonus for the selecting player, sounds weird when you read the rules, but it works quite well in practice. The only random element is in drawing quarry tiles after every production action, in an interesting way of simulating the exhaustion of some quarries and the eventual activation of new ones.

The production is adequate at best, marred by a glossy board with valleys in the folds. The tiny temple columns are charming, but terribly fiddly. The gameplay, however, more than compensates for these inconveniences.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2017)

I hate when there are very different games with similar names. I tried to buy Hellas (Rio Grande Games Edition 2002) and I bought Hellas (White Goblin Games 2016). Both games have no relation except for the name. I played the game first on Yucata before opening it. It is an ok game but nothing too exciting.

The rules of the game aren’t very hard to explain. You can do it under 12 minutes. It plays rather fast.

The theme is ok, you don’t feel it very much in the game.

The game´s decisions aren’t very hard nor too obvious. When you execute most actions, you also allow your opponents to do the same action and that’s neat. Players are fighting over the best spots in the map.

Bottom line, Hellas is an ok game. I feel it would have been a great game a long time ago, it feels old somehow. There is nothing innovative in it, but it is a solid game. I would play again if requested and my appreciation of the game can even go up with more plays but I already sold it.

RATING: 7
Players have three rounds to build cities and connect them to temples and monuments to score points. Building columns for the temples brings additional points and introduces a small majority competition. A steady supply of marble has to be maintained. The central element is the selection of an action. Some can be executed by other players as well, others are exclusive.

Old-fashioned, abstract, lean, short. Variation comes from the player interaction which can be mean. It's a good game but I doubt that there's a buying public out there making it worthwile for the publisher. No special powers, no cards, no drafting, no combos. Hellas feels more like a light alternative to Tigris & Euphrates. I'm surprised that a title with such a strong pre-2000 vibe can get published in 2016. While modern games offer a plentitude of mechanisms and random elements for exploration, Hellas offers a simple framework within which the players interact.

Méltatlanul alulértékelt, ismeretlen darab a Hellas. Az a kategória, ami a tapasztalatlan játékosoknak is tanítható, szóval egyszerű szabályrendszerű, de mégis érdekes, összetett játékmenet, játékérzet élhető át vele. Rengeteg az interakció nem csak a területfoglalás miatt, hanem a bányák felhelyezésénél is , érdekes helyzetek alakulnak ki, nagy jelentősége lehet egy-egy döntésnek. Remek családi játék, de gémerek is élvezhetik, vannak mélységei bőven.

Trustworthy designer Stefan Dorra's late entry to the Worker Placement genre is a really good game in itself. The problem is it would have been a much bigger hit 6 to 10 years ago. For action selection, this game combines worker placement with its predecessor, the Puerto Rico-like action selection (when everyone takes the action selected by a player, more than half of the actions are like this) that was also used in numerous games since. All this is used for constructing stuff on a hexagonal map where you are trying to connect to the best spaces, make your largest city score a lot, block others and so on. It also has a very small hint of Kreta in the mining action. It's a neat, well-developed, well-constructed game, even if it does not feature any novelty or idea that you have not seen in this decade before (well, I guess the mining can be called somewhat novel. I love it.)

Surprised by how good this is. In a time when many gamers perceive (or mistake?) sheer complexity for quality, here's a clear game design which is easy to learn but not quite so easy to master. 
Reminds me of Dorra's masterpiece Medina (though decisions are not as meaningful) with a bit of Taluva flavour added.

Very simple game where you build buildings on a map to score points at the end of the game. The game is very old school in its approach with clean rules, but some strategy layers to explore. It all seems to not matter as much in the beginning what you do, but after a few plays I found out that every bad decision can lose you the game. Very tight game especially if you play it with an experienced player. I like it, but I didn't fall in love with it.

RATING: 6
Very bland euro that feels as if it's from a bygone era. Abstract too, which is not my thing. The game itself is decent, but with actions being out of balance, sometimes followed by others, sometimes not, it just doesn't make me feel this game should've come to be. Just not for me...

RATING: 6.5
Players are building a Greek civilzation by building villages and mining marble at quarries. You use the marble to  build palaces, temples, statues or more villages. You are trying to build a city beside all the monuments to score points. Each turn you select an action from the available choices - some actions other players can do, while some actions only you can do. When you mine marble, you have to close a quarry, and open a new quarry. The other actions are building villages, or building special buildings. 

It can be a tactical game as you try to shut out your opponents from temples or quarries. It's an okay game, it seems more like a filler as there are only three rounds and there isn't much variety in the actions. It does make it simpler to understand, but can be a little dry in the implementation. For people who like tactical aspects of trying to shut out your opponents, you'll enjoy it.

RATING: 6.5
At first it seems quite simple and it is as you simple collect resources to build up cities but the interaction of the pieces and how you gain resources versus how you gain points is a fairly subtle strategy. You block off others while attempting to mine stone at quarries but that only gives you resources, to get points you must be near columns that are not build at the start. One of those games that you have limited actions so you must remember the end goal before it is too late. Played a few times and it is more interesting each time.

Action selection game where some actions allow for other people to piggy back on. Ultimately I don't think there is enough here to really stand on.

tl;dr: nice classic style euro

[person=13][/person] has been around for a while. You know, from back in the day of those classic euros. The ones that where simpler and more elegant than those of today. I'm not saying that is better or worse than what we have today, but these days games are either simple and light or not so simple and not so light. Back in the day they managed to make medium weight games with very streamlined designs in a way you don't see as much today.
But this game brings back that flavor. Very simple, sort rules with few components yet not too light. There is enough planning and strategy to interest the more hardcore gamer.
On the other hand I must say that this game doesn't do anything we haven't seen before and while to does everything it does very well, it doesn't do anything in an exceptional way. It just remixes a bunch of things that feel familiar without explicitly copying anything from any particular game.
So a very solid game, just not exceptional.

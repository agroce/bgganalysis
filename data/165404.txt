RATING: 6.5
I have a bit mixed feelings about this. Regarding gameplay mechanics, it offer nothing really new. There is not much developement in the game, and the luck factor is extremely high, a little too high for my taste. Increasing your flaming abilities does hardly guarantee better success in future fights thus.

On the other hand it features not only extraordinary components and fun with the flaming tower of death. The theme is well integrated and it's really a wonderful feature, that you don't just gather victory points, but that the accomplished mission cards add to your story, which in the end really result in a text which can be read out. I also like the title you're getting for your dragon.

So not much of strategy or intersting mechanics in here, but very nice looks and a lot theme flavour.

I enjoyed the game but I wouldn't play it very often probably.

Dragonscroll combines Carcassonne-ish tile laying with some cheerful carnage as we dragons travel the country incinerating any fantasy folk or goats that cross our paths.  Chucking balls down the Flaming Tower of Death is way more fun than simply rolling dice. It simply and cleverly makes it easiest to kill orcs and toughest to slay knights and wizards.  The little sections of narrative on each objective card that build into the tale of your fearsome dragon at the end are another delightful touch.  If only Dragonscroll engaged my brain as much as my funny bone and my sense of whimsy, it would rate very highly indeed.

As ever with Fragor, the production quality is high.  The four ceramic dragons are particularly characterful.

Luck Fest with no way to mitigate bad luck. Luck of card draws, luck of tile draws, luck of ball drops. The ball drops being more random than even dice rolls. We played 4 adult players and no one cares to play again. 

In our game I got elf killer secret game goal - meaning I needed to save the elves for end game scoring, then all card goals I drew for victory points were kill 3 elves (X2) and kill 3 - 4 things at once (X3). Couple that with unlucky tile draws and rolls, I ended up -4 victory points. The highest score was +15, because that person got multiple goals of flip two tiles in a turn or other things that could actually be done. I even got a minus when rolling 7 balls, because I missed!!! That is a lot of balls for one turn incidentally.  The fact that unlucky misses also remove a victory point, it just adds insult to injury. I was only able to accomplish the "kill 2 things in one turn" goal for 2 points. Despite drawing many cards, I never got anything accomplish-able. I mean I had 6 flames in the end, but even then couldn't roll what I needed to kill what I needed to kill. I think kids would love the game, and that is the only reason this gets a 2. I would never play this again. I mean my dragon did not even have a story to tell. Just not fun.

The flaming tower of death is a really fun mechanic. As far as the rest of the game goes, nothing too out of the box here, but still really fun.

Even if I like this game it really bothers me that the tower is almost useless (some enemies are never hit). We consider to use 4 sided dice instead of the tower - what is pretty sad - becasue the idea of the tower is so neat...

Gordon Lamont informed me, that it is a good idea to throw all balls together in the tower and not one by one. We will try it and if it works better I will correct my comment and the rating.

BTW: Thanks to Gordon Lamont for the very quick response to my critique.

Great concept, just too much luck. I detest games so reliant on a luck factor. It takes all the strategy out of it. The flaming tower seemed cool but once you use it enough times, it just frustrates you. I'd rather have some d4 dice. At least those would be more consistent. 

It has a lot of cuteness, but that wears off once your inner child stops caring.

A fast playing game, which looks gorgeous. Played with two yesterday and definitely had fun. Would love to play it with more.
Randomness might be an issue for some, but then again dragons aren't the most precise weapon anyway. And if it really bugs you, make the dragon have focused fire for a certain hit and with less fireballs somehow for this throw or the next ... no game has set rules.

After one play, a 4-player game. The Tower of Flaming Death could be a little maddening, but the chaos fits the theme. The tokens for knights, dwarves, and elves are pretty generic, and I'm replacing them with meeples. For 4 players the game felt like it ended too quickly. Perhaps better as 2? Also want to explore bonus (destiny) scoring as an open, shareable target--i.e., whoever gets the most dwarves gets that bonus, etc.

This is not a gamer's game. Yes, there's strategy involved, but you'll probably get more enjoyment out of this one if you approached it as a casual game that rewards you with silly fun for small tactical accomplishments. It's a good one to pull out when you're more interested in the narrative arc than burning your brain to defeat your opponents.

Wife loves it. I'll say, there is something pretty fun about pouring those dragonballs down the chute and watching them land.

Update: Novelty wears off quickly. I feel like it would need many more tiles for the game to be satisfying; as it is, it's difficult for players to accomplish much. I guess there's the benefit of having a shorter game, but it leaves me wanting.

This game is quite fun.  An interesting narrative is revealed as you fly around discovering cities, wizards, and orc princesses.  Make sure to eat plenty of goats so you can grow big and strong to ensure you have enough fireballs to take down all of your foes.  Great components to include the amazing Tower of Death.  This was my first Fragor game and I highly recommend it!

A lot of fun. I love Carcassonne; this feels like the legends the people of Carc-land would be telling each other over ale on a winter's eve. The tile play can be tactical and some people love trying to master the 'dice tower' (which is a ball-tower really). The winner has the honour of reading out the exploits of their dragon. The losers do not. Which is nice.

Unboxing y primer juego.
Los componentes 10/10 y hacen que la historia sea agradable. Aunque me considero un apasionado de la temática de los Dragones este juego realmente te atrapa. La torre de la muerte le añade un toque de "azar" que si bien no lo puedes controlar. Si lo puedes minimizar teniendo mayor número de fireballs por disparar. En conclusión a pesar de que la caja dice +13 mis dos hijos 5 y 11 lo lograron entender, disfrutar y admirar. Y para mi eso ya de por si es suficiente para valorarlo como un éxito dentro de nuestra colección familiar. No vemos la hora de volverlo a jugar. Valoración inicial 10 03/04/2015

Fun tile based game with a gimmicky tower.  The tower is a lot of fun though and my favorite part.  Like it a lot.  The sheep/goat meeples are fun and trying to score points is a lot of fun.  Bad luck can be mitigated or not which gives a lot of strategy.

RATING: 8.5
My first Fragor game is shaping up to be quite the hit. While aside from the flaming tower of death the rest of the mechanics are very ordinary, they are well blended together. The rules are pretty light but the turns and their decisions are always interesting. There's no direct interaction but subtle opportunities for blocking or making things a bit harder for your opponents. And the idea that the winner can tell his story at the end is a very nice touch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The simple turn structure of revealing a tile, moving, and then attacking is reminiscent of the "Zombies" series or some of the lighter dungeon crawls.  Having said that, it's the little touches that elevates this family friendly title above the rest.  Players have specific goals and a revolving trio of bonus actions.  Also, the uncertainty of successfully making an attack, thanks to the "Flaming Tower of Death", keeps things exciting.

Rating this a '7' after a single play.  That rating could see some adjustments after getting a few more plays in.

After three plays, I think I'm done.  While the fireball tower is kind of cool, whether you're successful is pretty much random and the only control you have is whether you add more fireballs.  The rest of the game is pretty cool, but since it all comes down to how well you roll those fireballs, one can get frustrated quickly.  

FIRST IMPRESSION:  This is another enjoyable lighter game from Fragor Games.  There is quite a bit of luck involved in this game so if that isn't something you can handle, give this game a wide berth.  The fire ball tower is a fun gimmick but I wish they would have built a larger spout as it can be difficult to roll 5-6 fireballs down the spout.  One can exert some cleverness in placement of tiles and increasing one's probabilities when dispensing fireballs.  Thought the end game where everyone reads their story was pretty clever and fun as well.  Wizards can be hellish.

Like all Fragor games, beautiful components, nice thematic experience with the writing of the dragon's story, and a simple, family friendly gameplay. The dragon tower adds tons of luck, the game isn't to be taken too seriously and is to be enjoyed for what it is.

RATING: 6
Some of the components in this game are very cute: the houses and the dragons are quite nicely done. The rest are less impressive: dwarf cubes, elf cubes, orc cubes, goat meeples that are definitely sheep meeples, wizard blobs, knight knobs, and a game box that is so flimsy it has started falling in on itself. This is a cute game, I enjoyed playing it with the grandkids - but it's absolutely necessary to skip the "broken minstrel" rule.

RATING: 6
The few times I played this now, it was fun enough.
It's quiet light and luck-dependent from the gameplay and it feels a little bit like Carcassone meets Takenoko (tile laying and capturing/eating things for points).

Initially the flaming tower of death felt like a very fancy version of a d4, but we've found it to be actually quiet different from a d4 as the distribution is not equal into the 4 compartments, which is actually a good thing. At least for us (maybe we were also "lucky" in putting the tower together in a biased way :D ), orcs seems to be hit more likely than knights and wizards, which makes sense as they are more common in the game. 

Is production value overshadowing the actual "quality" of the gameplay? Probably. It's my first Fragor game and I'm quiet impressed by the love for detail that went into the game. But if a game is more fun because it has cute big dragon figures and a flaming tower of death rather than a few meeples and some dice then that's the way it is and also slightly goes into my rating. For now this is staying in my collection and if it's only for the fun of throwing fireballs in the tower once in a while. :D

After seeing this in the BGG news earlier in the year and then seeing the game available at the Funagain booth @BGGCon for $150, I was excited to find this available in the BGGCon library and wanted to find out if I would enjoy this game.  If I liked it, I would definitely want to buy it and play it with my 3 and 4 yo kids. Who doesn't love adorable dragons, am I right?

My 2 BGGCon buddies and I eagerly set this game up and ooh'd and aah'd at the awesome dragon and village sculptures that came with the game.  I also couldn't wait to roll some balls down the fireball device!!

We continued to ooh and aah as we found out about the way the story of the dragon was told as we accomplished our quests.  What a cool and novel idea!

After reading the rules and understanding that this was like Carcassonne with dragons (AweSOME!!), we started playing the game.  It was fun at first, but after the 3rd or 4th round, we started to figure out that the fireball device didn't work very well.  It's completely random and ours kept going to the wizard/knight side.  We checked the table to make sure it wasn't lopsided and even turned the tower around, but it's just completely random.  There's absolutely not strategy to it, you just hope and pray that you get the one you're looking for.

I do like the powers mechanic where you have to flip the card after you use it, but honestly, about 3/4 of the way through the 2 hr game we played, all 3 of us were ready to call it quits.  I normally try to play through any game, but i wanted to end this one ASAP.  If either one of my buddies had said so, I would've been ready to call it quits immediately.

Not only is it random, it's too complicated for a kid to play so I'm not sure who the audience is here.

My rating is based on the BGG recommendations.  I do not ever want to play this game again.

RATING: 5
The player and hut pieces to this game are beautiful, the fireballs are nice to hold, but every other bit in this game seems shoddy. The pieces representing the different things your dragon fights don't seem well thought out, as they all look remarkably unlike each other. It just has the look of some bits that were lying around. The gameplay itself is overall fun, although for combat you roll fireballs into this tower, where they land in 1 of 4 sides, and one has to land in the fight side to hit the thing you are fighting. We found the tower to be kitschy but infinitely more frustrating than just rolling a D4. It's like rather than random chance, you can't kill what you need to kill because you suck at an impossible dexterity game. Really, the issue is, the balls don't land evenly on all 4 sides. It's much much harder to land a fireball on 2 of the 4 sides, which makes it difficult when you are randomly dealt a major point goal to kill X amount of one of those two types. I'm going to take a break from this game. There's a lot to like, I just don't know if it mechanically works... but the idea of replacing the cool tower with D4s to make it work is kind of heartbreaking in it's own right.

A light storytelling adventure game.  really you are just going around collecting things and trying to finish off cards to add to your story all while keeping an eye on your destiny card. It is pretty fun and is about an hour to play which is just right for a game like this. Any longer at it would be too long.  One problem is the flaming tower.  It's not sound or symmetrical when put to together even though it looks like it is supposed to be so the balls don't fall evenly.

A nice, fun, light game. Not breaking any huge ground here, but good fun. Rated a 6 due to the usual Fragor problem: rules that need an edit badly. Not nearly as incomprehensible as Poseidon's Kingdom (First Edition), but there are some ambiguities here and there, and some points that are sort of lost amongst the clutter. I wouldn't call this Chvatil bad... certainly readable. But could be better.

Actually put down a pre-payment to pre-order to pick it up in Essen 2014. However, on the sight of the flimsy dicetower, the small resin components (compared to Spellbound, they are about half the size) and the overall crappiness of the game otherwise, decided to ask my money back.

I read the rule-book, seemed to me a simple 'collect some VP' game without any strategy and only some tactics involved. 

All in all: no unique smart mechanism to fling spells to your oppontents, components crappier as I'd been expecting from Fragor and very shallow gameplay: pass.

Try before you buy. Or if you're interested in the component quality of Fragor: go for Spellbound instead.

RATING: 5
tl;dr: a disappointment

Each year I play the new Fragor game. Each year I'm hoping their crazy ideas and great components make a good game. Sometimes they come close, sometimes they don't come close. I quite like [thing=30483][/thing], I really didn't like [thing=23848][/thing].
This game combines a ball tower and tile laying with resource collection. The tile laying doesn't add much to the game, it doesn't really inject any fun challenge like it does in [thing=822][/thing]. The fighting with the ball tower sounds fun, but there is a huge problem: the tower is broken. Killing orcs is SO easy, killing knights and wizards is doable, but elves and dwarfs are very, very difficult. That is the result of the design of the tower. It results in the player holding the orc scoring card having a real easy time of scoring big points.
But most of all the game isn't challenging nor entertaining. It's just so incredibly bland.
A disappointment

Playce a tile, find an enemy to fight, use the most inconvenient d4 ever invented. Cash in your trophy for more fireballs or points. Not too exciting, actually. The best part of the game was actually reading the rules, which are really entertaining.

Ridiculously overproduced components mixed with very simple ones. Minor production issues like sheep pieces instead of goats and tile design that could be improved regaring visibility and clearness. 

OK, and although I called the flaming tower of death an inconvenient d4, it is in fact quite fun to drop balls into this thing. 

Will try again to see whether the rating improves - perhaps there is more depth to discover.

The mechanics are solid and sound, the gameplay runs along smooth, rules are intuitive, and it is tons of fun. Playing a story as it unfolds within the Fragor quality universe lets me immerse myself into the game. And that's a quality I don't usually get out of your typical challenging brainburniness. Every once in a while it's quite nice to have something like this! And if its a more "mature" game system you are looking for there's Fragors Antics! for you. That is, it's not really there for you.  You'd have to take a mortgage on your house and then be lucky to obtain one of the rare copies, but theoretically it's there for you.

Next to Snow Tails, this has to be the best Fragor game I played so far.

Would certainly play if it hits the table again in my playgroup.

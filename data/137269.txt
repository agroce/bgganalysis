This game is criminally underrated in my opinion.  The steam punk theme might seem a little abstract.  But it's actually not.  Each of the characters you can visit have a very specific role and their mechanics reflect this.  Excellent worker placement game.  Try it!  It's a shame it will probably never get an expansion.

Played it twice and I like it a lot. The worker placement and the game of chicken of moving from placement to activation works really well. A worker placement game where rushing to get more workers isn't necessarily best - I love that aspect, as in many cases that isn't so.
Very compact, and inexpensive to boot, I think it's a winner.

+ Surprisingly quick game with a unique area control sort of mechanic; Tight cash situations make every of your decisions mean just that much more.
- It seems like there should be more variety in the market cards, particularly the building cards.


Why it's previously-owned:
This game is solid, but it doesn't do anything interesting or cool to demand attention in amongst an increasingly-deep game collection.
This was given to my best friend who shares many of my gaming interests and preferences; I think it'll be a game he can get to the table and enjoy.

I love this game!  Feels tight the whole way through.  Money is critical but so is everything else.  The screwage is excellent, unavoidable and necessary.  I love how the patents push/pull on everything.

My only concern is that sometimes the residential track might be a little strong.  As long as more than one person pushes it then it should be fine.  (Don't let one person monopolize the residential actions if they come up early, say turns 1 and 2.)

MORE:  I've done that in [-]2[/-] [i]3[/i] games now - abuse the residential track.  First game (3p) was a crushing win.  Third or fourth game (5p) was a win by ~20 points or so (if memory serves), not quite crushing.  Another (10/24/13) was a 5p win by ~6-8 points or so.  Still, it is a mild concern, though I have yet to see a game where more than one person aggressively pursues that strategy.

AND MORE FOLLOW UP:  I think it will depend on how/when the residential things come up.  I've now seen games where it would have been a bad choice to pursue that strategy.  May also depend on if/when the residential event comes up.  I'm not so sure it's unbalanced, but I'm also not 100% sure it isn't.

Also, I LOVE THIS GAME!  Scales well all the way from 3 to 5.  Beautiful!  Love it every time!  Might have to up my rating from 9 to 10.  Must play it more!

EDIT (3/25/16):  Yeah, after more plays, the residential strategy COMPLETELY depends on the cards and events.  I've seen games where it would be foolhardy to push the residential track.  I've also seen some excellent combos that aren't immediately obvious.  And I've seen how tempo is a tremendous factor throughout the game.  In a 5-player game, as the 4th or 5th player I like to sacrifice a worker on the first turn to gain tempo on the other players.  Oddly enough, this is huge and helps offset the advantage that the earlier turn order affords.  This is interesting to me.

I really, [i]really[/i] like this game.  And one of my favorite aspects is how it so readily and seamlessly scales from 3-5 players.  Play time doesn't dramatically increase and gameplay actually changes a bit.  Kind of cool.

Great worker placement game.  The placement/pick up mechanic is really neat, and the dynamic works well.  You can almost always get something if you really want it, but the cost can be very high.  Every time your opponent grabs something you want you feel "I could have had that if I played a little differently".   So many good choices to mull over.

It's unabashedly a Euro game. The mechanics make very little thematic sense. It's dry. It's about converting money, spyrium, and manpower into points. But it's also got a unique marketplace with a pleasant game flow. And it  has a fair amount of variability, so fun.

Spyrium is an odd game.  It doesn't quite have the brilliance of Caylus, but it's half as long and very clever.  It's a thoroughly inoffensive game - it takes few risks and just plays solidly, taking a bunch of reasonably good attributes (worker locationing, engines with workers and tap cards, synergistic buildings) and throwing them together into something that looks interesting and works alright.

You know, if you made a portable board of some sort it could probably fit into a tiny container, since the board is the only big piece...

Also, the Spyrium crystals look cool.

Spyrium is an engine building game, yet it keeps it very simple.  There are just two resources: money and spyrium.  Money is needed principally to buy buildings; run short of it and your options shrink dramatically.  Spyrium needs to be mined and then is mostly turned into victory points in factories.  So you need both mines and factories. Simple.

That simplicity allows us to focus on some much more interesting decisions around timing; when to transition from one phase of the turn to the next; when to take money instead of buying or making use of a card; when to buy a card at over the odds because an opponent will take it if you don't; when to buy time by doing those things you could do at any point like run your engine or use this turn's event.

Spyrium is a thoroughly well crafted design.  The cards provide just enough variety to offer alternative strategies.  There's just enough time to get your engine running to full efficiency and then the game is over.  

The artwork is at the subtle end of Steampunk and the better for it.  Production quality is very good.  The rules are pretty clear and readable.

An interesting worker placement game with a range of quite cleverly designed mechanisms.  I enjoyed it, although a 5-player game was very long (over 2.5 hours with a lot of chance for AP) and extremely competitive.  Being lucky or in a position to setup a fortunate strategy can lead to a runaway leader.  Worker placement just doesn't seem to be my style of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Spyrium is a game which looks simple and the rules are quite straightforward, but the strategy is hard to build. After a 2-player game, I have the feeling that with multiple players the game gets easier because there's a lot more money in the game. Leaving details aside, this is a game which can (or should) only be played by competitive people, it's cutthroat (which I love) and the player interaction is almost vicious. I will play it again and soon.

From Caylus's designer, I had very high hopes, and alas, this game dashed them.  For me, this game glaringly lacks theme, and essentially parades conversion efficiency questions in your face, turn after boring turn to the point where I feel like I am playing an uninspired abstract, in this case an uninspired abstract euro.  

Yes, Spyrium does provide worker placement on randomized matrices decisions, and the decision of when to the pull the workers off for an effect, or more money, but to me, this is a very thin foundation for a fun game. There are many far better worker placement games out there, that actually have well integrated themes, and frankly, more interesting, and in some cases amusing (eg wake up times in Fresco), mechanics.

So I was completely lost the first half of the game. Then it started to gel a bit. I think you have to know the cards and how they can work together, or you're sunk. Honestly I was ready to proclaim it "one and done", but then the lightbulb went on dimly. This is not my kind of game, and I can't see buying it. But I'd play it occasionally as long as the duration between games is short enough that I don't forget everything.

Probably the most Euro complexity you can get for your money. Small box. Big game. Worker placement mixed with area majority to give you (possibly) access to locations or special abilities. What's neat is that you place the worker between locations giving you a chance to get something even if what you really wanted gets taken by someone else. So you have quite a bit to think about in that regard. It can be prone to pull AP players into a fugue from time to time however so be wary of that. And except for that is runs like clockwork. A deep complex game in a small package. I do agree with Richard Ham though. Why did they even bother with the "Spyrium" concept. Making this game some weird steam-punk world doesn't really brings anything to it. They could just has easily have mad it about coal mining and it would have been just as good. Maybe Attia didn't want to try and compete with "Coal Baron."

Probably my first or second euro game that I've really enjoyed. Other worker placement games like Lords of Waterdeep and/or Agricola feel so frustrating if someone takes that spot you want. 

This game gives you a way of benefiting off of that, e.g., make it more expensive for them to purchase, giving some monies to yourself to buy something else in less demand. 

I really like how resources feel tight all around. It limits choice and makes decision making in a turn a bit quicker. For me, this feels more like a resource management / engine building game than traditional? worker placement.

This game is underrated in my opinion.  For what is in the box there is a lot of game.  Worker placement / reverse worker placement is a great game mechanic and this game pulls it off perfectly.  Plays out over the course of six rounds.  The first three using the A stack cards, the next two using the B stack cards and the last one using C.  Cards get more expensive and have better abilities in the later rounds but make sure you have the money to buy them and know when to transition to the buying phase to make sure you get what you want before someone else takes it.

This game is very underrated. The setup may lead people to think this game is more simplistic than it really is. There is a lot more than meets the eye here. The complexity is in the decision-making and not in the deciphering of rules. That's the sort of thing I love in a euro. I paid less than $20, but I'd have paid more for such a well-designed game.

The only negative I can think of is dealing with iconography if you dislike that sort of thing. There will be some referencing the book for the function of a few cards, but it was fine to pick up.

In Spyrium, workers are used as a form of currency to buy/used cards in an auction mechanic; because of this, the game reminds me of Keyflower... but that's about as far as the similarities go. Overall, this is a very solid, very engaging, optimization problem that doesn't overstay its welcome. There seems to be several strategies and each action feels like a tactical decision based on what others players have done. This isn't the type of game where you can approach it from a fixed strategic point-of-view... you must constantly react and adjust to other players. And while this is a card game, it's not luck driven; the distribution of cards is limited enough where players can plan out their future turn. And the last round is fixed, which creates some brain-burning decisions as you attempt to optimize your actions with consideration of those cards and what others players may do. 


That being said, I've played this game over 20 times and feel like I've explored most it has to offer. While the tactical problems change each round... the game itself feels quite similar. Because of that, it doesn't enamor me anymore... but it's still a very strong game.

Another great game from Mr. Attia. The mechanics are very simple, but the actual combinations of what you can do seem limitless. Those are the marks of a great game, in my mind.

I'll have to play it some more times, but it all points towards my score for this game rising.

UPDATE: I love this game. I want to buy it and play it face-to-face, but it's my favorite BGA game by far.

UPDATE: Bought it and played it once in real life. It's even better than on-line. One of my favorite games, and it might even rise to a perfect 10 in the future.

Thought I was a long way adrift with only three buildings and little Spyrium.  But only 5 points off winner in equal third (of five).  So very well balanced as would expect from Attia and Tom Lehman.  Nice decisions on timing and choices of use.  Similar positive feeling as Keyflower.  Recommended.

RATING: 8
A good, solid euro game, by the same designer of Caylus.
The theme makes sense: build mines to get spyrium and then use factories or labs to turn it into VP. But the part where you put workers and then get Money for each worker there isn't very thematic, but as a game mechanic works.
Interesting balance between putting more workers and potencially get money when removing them but have less cards available as they get bought, or put few workers down and quickly buy the card you want while it's still somewhat cheap but that leaves you with fewer options to do other things.

Nem vártam, hogy újra Caylus-szintű játékkal rukkol elő a szerző, de azért akaratlanul is sokat vártam a játéktól. És az a helyzet, hogy nem rossz! Jó az alapmotor, és van néhány nagyon jó ötlet benne...(pl. I.-ből II. szakaszba lépés időzítése, a munkások lehelyezése-elvétele, stb.) szerintem egy egészen kiugró játék is kerekedhetett volna belőle. Ha! Ha kihozza belőle a maximumot Attia. De szerintem nem hozta ki. Talán több fajta épület kellett volna, vagy kevesebb kör, nem tudom, de a vége felé nem volt izgalmas, mert ugyanazok, vagy nagyon hasonló épületek ismétlődtek körökön át. A hangulatot rontotta, hogy egy faék taktika szinte gondolkodás nélkül nyert (kevés emberrel, 0 működő épülettel, folyamatosan csak 7 pontok szerzésével). Nekem összességében jó játékélmény, de zavar, hogy lehetett volna akár az év játéka is, de nem lett, csak olyan "jó, de nem veszem meg" szint. Aki a worker placementet szereti, azért feltétlenül próbálja ki, én magam szívesen játszom vele máskor is!!

His Caylus' majesty William Attia is back with another game after many years far from the scenes.
Spyrium is an odd game: it is an euro about resource conversion, with an unusual (tacked on) steam punk theme and very tight gameplay.

The game lasts 6 rounds, divided in three phases: A (rounds 1-3), B (rounds 4-5) and C (round 6). In each phase a new deck (with more powerful cards) is used to create a 3x3 grid of nine cards. The grid is used to place workers, which are then removed to gain money (more with more other workers around the same card), activate or purchase cards (with additional costs for each other worker around the same card).

The mechanic is quite original, there's lots of competition, difficult choices and room for different strategies and tactical jockeying. Everything inside a smaller than usual box (thanks Ystari!), with a cheap price.

Could be a bit abstract, but is engaging enough to make me wanting to explore it more deeply. Initial tentative rating after two half games and one full game is 7, but could go up...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed playing this game. At first I was afraid that Spyrium would be subpar. This is a card game which uses the same grid system as Guilds of Cadwallon but now more than one player can stand in between the 2 cards.

I like the decision when you choose to transit from the first phase (placement of workers) to the second phase (removing the workers). What cards to take and when to take it is also important since the cost of the card is higher when there are other workers (yours or that of other players) are around.

The cards work well together and the board is like Bruges, just for scoring purposes. All in all a great game and look forward to more plays.

First Play: rules explanation didn't really prepare me for how advantageous knowledge of the decks would be. Success is highly dependent on developing a firing engine by round 2. The green contracts are too powerful to be ignored. Without an efficient engine early doors you will struggle  and the gulf between the haves and have nots will only widen.

The game has clever mechanisms but this first 'learning' game was a bit of a struggle and the winner was clear an hour before the game ended.  Without strategy advice beyond a basic run through of the rules a new comer is likely to have a back seat during the game.

Brian and I played a 2player game of this for our Hurricane Irma Friday. Neither of us had played before, but it still only took about 45 minutes to play. For a shorter game, however, Spyrium packs a lot of meaty decisions. When to move on to Phase 2 so you can activate your buildings or remove guys to get money (which is incredibly tight) is very key to victory. There is a good mixture of 1 time effects as well as money and/or VP boosters to try to acquire. The way cards are acquired is also rather unique. Brian won 59-52 with a big last turn. I would probably only play this as a 2 player game as I would think 3 or more would get a little crowded and you could really get screwed out of some good cards. Keeper.

 William Attia, the designer of Caylus, brings us Spyrium... This could be described as "Just Another Soulless Euro" with a pasted on theme. It has worker placement mechanics with resource conversion for victory points.

There are two phases to the game; you first start by placing workers around cards and then switch to retrieving workers for actions and money. The more workers are around a card, the more a card is worth to purchase or the more money you can gain since you can collect money based on how many workers are left after you pull him out. There are other aspects to the game, but that's it in a nutshell.

The innovative aspect to the game is that players could be in different phases at the same time. When to switch phases is the crux and engaging mechanic that drives the game. Other than that, it's just another build your engine resource conversion game. 

The production values, price point, quick playtime and artwork are excellent for this small box footprint game and it seems to have sufficient replay value... I enjoy Euros, so it sat well with me, but some members of my play group were of a different opinion; thinking that it was bland and bringing nothing particularly new to the table. I was of a different opinion; although not dazzled.

I love the unique spacial auction worker placement system. There is so much delightful tension as to when and where you want to place workers / pull them off to either purchase something or collect income. It provides a deeply rich space for strategy and tactics, and your decisions are completely tied to what your opponents want to do. It's fantastic. It's also not too difficult for new players to learn.

OK, so a fairly interesting euro with two currencies and several paths to victory. Quite punishing interaction with lots of opportunities to screw other people out of actions (or screw yourself if you are not careful - tough when you are learning). Longer than you might expect for a handful of cards (took us over 2 hours for a first time 5p), so this all seems like heavy euro territory and yet something didn't feel quite right, it felt sort of, erm, light. Don't know why but it did and whilst it is a decent game, I am not sure I want to spend 2 hours on something that feels this light.

The theme for this game is amazing, although not as strongly represented as it could be by the gameplay. I love the Victorian steampunk art. The worker placement in the market is quite unique and provides for some really interesting player interaction as you try to out think the other players and gain maximum advantage. The engine building is a bit simple for my taste, and I would have liked more variation in the cards (the patents are great though).

RATING: 7
A push-your-luck, worker placement, dutch auction, resource engine building game that plays in 45 - 90 minutes.

Have now reached 4 plays and think this games has legs.  It feels like there are multiple strategies.  Players generally will want to have some sort of mine/factory thing, but lots of money can work too (particularly with capitalization).  Workers can be very useful but costs need to be considered.  2-player games are much cash poorer so the residences are much more important.  

After 4 plays, I'm beginning to feel like I can start exploring this game.  I think if played with people of roughly equal skill, the game has the potential for a lot of play since, ultimately, the dutch auction mechanic means players can ensure that other players are paying what a card is worth.  My biggest concern is can I get gameplay down to 1 hour for 4 players.  I've gotten it to 35 - 40 minutes with 2 players so I think 1 hour with 4 is possible.  That would make this a game that could regularly get in the rotation.  Small box is a plus too (although the box could have been even smaller if they replaced the board with some VP chips and a couple of cards).

I envy a designer who can come up with a game like Spyrium - such a totally 'clean' thoroughly thought-through concept not needing the support of any additional make-weight 'fat'.  I originally thought that the game might be flawed when on my first play (4 players) I roared ahead for most of the game.  But powerful cards appeared at the end with the result that due to completely different playing approaches one player finally overtook me by just 1 point and another by 2 - a sure sign of a well tested perfect game.   However I do recommend the removal of the Technical card that allows its owner to take a card without having to pay the extra £1 per meeple round that card.  It totally disrupts game play.

Very well-designed and easy to play after a round or two of getting used to the mechanics. This went over well with non-euro gamers too, since the worker placement and card drafting mechanics can be very aggressive and confrontational. This is definitely not a typical "multiplayer solitaire" type of euro, even though it sounds like it might play that way.

Decent enough, but very dry; the steampunk theme is not even wafer thin and evaporates on opening the box, not even making it from the cards onto the small board - which looks like it comes from a different game entirely. 

This is a not quite by the numbers euro game of investing/recycling resources to generate victory points - the main distinguishing features being a relatively large dollop of chaos as to what opportunities arise each round (due to the card draw) and a rather more interesting than usual worker placement subsystem - reminding me of the marketplace in Hermagor - driving option choice and cost in a way which makes for interesting and tough choices most turns.

RATING: 6
In Spyrium, players are placing workers in a grid of cards each turn, placing each worker between two cards.  Players may use these workers to activate the cards, which do various things.

Some cards are claimed, giving game long abilities which allows players to build their own personal engine.  Some cards have special effects as well as end game bonuses.  And others give immediate one time bonuses.

The game is very interactive, as the placement of other players workers highly affects both the costs of the cards you activate, and you will also worry that other players will claim a card you had wanted, as the intentions of other players aren't always clear.

Overall, a good strategic game for those that like trying to carry out a game long strategy, while having to make adaptations to fit whatever cards come out.

Here's a good solid game with a lot of good solid mechanics and the semblance of an amazing theme... but something is missing...  and that something is the feeling of the theme coming through, or that I am building something, or towards something.  My engine doesn't feel like anything...  I definitely feel I did well in the game.  The decisions are good solid decisions to be made.  Do I place between these 2 cards, do I pull off and buy a card or use an ability or do I take the money for everyone around that card...  Do I hold a couple of guys back to activate buildings...  When do I use the special once a turn ability available to everyone?  It's all there... BUT I just can't see myself hunting this game out (Which means I will probably buy it within the month) but would happily play it if someone else suggested it.

RATING: 6
I really like the tension of pawns around cards. Pulling out early for money, nets you more money, and others less, but makes things cheaper to purchase. Buying early costs more, but buy too late and someone might buy it from under your nose.

That is the best part of the game. The rest is, unfortunately, just a standard engine building game. Get pawns to get more actions. Get money and cubes, convert them into victory points.

The techniques are underwhelming as they feel like hardcoded paths to victory.

Spyrium is a game of timing your actions in a way that minimizes your payments and maximizes your opponents, and I almost always love that element in a game.

I am not particularly interested in the resource conversion engine that drives the VP acquisition in the game, but the game is short enough that it ends before the engine really gets going, so it's mostly about managing your workers on the board. 

Not bad.

Spyrium is a good game, and the placing meeples between the cards rather than on the cards to give you a choice of which card to use is very clever. That said, the game suffers a bit from "too-many-symbols" and some rulebook quirks.

Also, none of the cards (for placing your meeples) ever really give the feeling of "that's awesome".  Everything feels mildly useful, until the last round where all the destinations are just major point scorers.

The other main thing that detracts from this game is the painful lack of money. Rather than presenting the player with an abundance of cool decisions on how to use the money (since basically every action requires money), instead, you spend your turns figuring out how many meeples you can afford to throw away so you can afford to buy one thing in a turn.

But a good worker placement game with a neat core mechanic.

Traded away.

RATING: 5.5
Spyrium is just another light, quick engine building eurogame; I already own a lot of those and don’t need to add a copy to my collection. The game evolves over time as better buildings become available. What’s interesting about the game is that there are two phases each round; you either place meeples or decide to pull them off, but you cannot place meeples anymore if you’ve chosen to remove one! This means that you have to decide how long you can hold on placing meeples, because if the other players are starting to remove their meeples, you’ll not get as good rewards. In continuation of this point, it was a neat twist that you either has to get some income or to pay a lot for the building you want when you remove workers (you place workers around cards, so you either have to pay the price or workers around the card, or you can get as much gold as there are workers around that card).

I don’t think that I would actively suggest playing this game again; however, to be fair, my one and so far only play of Spyrium was around 1:30 AM and I was well aware of the fact that I made a lot of mistakes because I was tired. So I think I owe it to the designer of the great Caylus to play Spyrium at least once again, perhaps with 3 players, and see if my opinion changes. However, I doubt it.

Played with four and it is definitely thinky for such a small box. I would be interested in playing it again, but thought 4 was too many as it took us almost 2 hours to play. It felt similar to Keyflower in that your workers will do a few things for you, in Spyrium you either get a card, action, or money for your workers and more workers around the card drives up the cost of it. With all that said, I'm not sure what it was about Spyrium but I didn't really enjoy it. I felt more like I was going through the motions than anything else, and I just couldn't feel the theme although the green Spyrium crystals are very cool.

RATING: 8
Elegant, economical, and beautiful in its mechanisms. Decisions are dense and tense. Of equal brilliance as Caylus, the mechanism that elevates it is the deduction / push-your-luck placement mechanism for card purchase vs. resource gathering. Timing is everything. An utter joy. The iconography is easy on the eyes, and the components are great. Plays fast, is quite easy to teach, and works well with all player counts. If I could have one wish, it would be that this game gets an expansion to freshen it up a bit. 

Make sure you play with the C cards face up from the start of the game, as they are really swingy goal cards. A classic.

Get ready to struggle with only one ressource in this game (well... two actually if you include money).

Very unique mechanism, where you reserve cards with your meeples, and acquire it by withdrawing said meeple and paying the cost plus one money for each other meeple around it.

Basic artwork, very light on theme (no, I did not believe in spyrium mining or the whole so-called steampunk universe), but very good game.

Medium box for a big game.

RATING: 7
I'll be the first to admit that the prospect of playing a new Attia game did not thrill me: his magnum opus Caylus proved to be a bit of a dud, and it wasn't until he created the cardgame version that I was able to make some sense of the game at all. So when information gradually started to drizzle down, about it being a cardgame and featuring a fresh twist on the worker placement mechanism, my anxiety subsided to the point where I'd be interested in giving the game a go.

The background of the game can be conveniently forgotten: it is completely silly and without redeeming merit. It is the umpteenth economic growth engine where a meager amount of starting materials is grown and gradually turned into VP. The interesting bit is in the worker placement mechanism. Like any good twist, it separates influence placement and withdrawal, allowing players to decide when they want to enter the withdrawal phase. This has the curious effect that the nominal value of cards the players surround with their workers actually decreases: it costs less to purchase and yields less money if you just withdraw a worker. The result is good mix of timing and blocking which integrates seamlessly with the rest of the game as well as its length. 

Spyrium is not a game which will blow you away, not by a long shot. But it offers a clean variation on the worker placement mechanism, is very polished and well-crafted removing any burr which might cause painful pricks, and plays with a pleasing rythm. Despite the utterly unremarkable engine the core mechanism has been bolted onto, I like this game far more than Ystari's equally new offspring Prosperity. Consequently, it has a greater chance of ending up in my collection, although I think that won't really happen for a good while yet.

[b]Update[/b] Eventually purchased a copy, played the game: yup, still the smoothly clicking and whirring mechanisms in place. It struck me that the game might actually be a 'do everything right from the beginning, and sprint to the end immediately'-sorta game, but there are slightly too many rounds in the game to fit into that general pattern. Still, there's hardly any dallying, and goes over well. A snag is that it doesn't work that great with just 2 players, and that at 5 player chaos becomes annoying to deal with. Stick to 3 or 4 players, and you'll be fine. The rate is for those latter cases.

Ok, so the theme is stupid. There was no reason to paste on a Steam-punk theme. It was surely designed as an industrial revolution game - the Spyrium is just coal.

However, the timing decisions around when to stop placing and start activating workers add a really interesting twist to the genre.

If you already have a bunch of middle-weight worker placement games, I can see that this might not be for you but if you don't, this would be an excellent addition to your collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A pretty themeless/dry resource conversion game. While the placement of workers to purchase or activate cards in the market is not bad, that mechanic was implemented much more interestingly in Hermagor.

The endgame, particularly the last round, really seems to bog down. Every possibility at that point is on the table, and the number of combinations and permutations just sort of explodes. We enjoyed the first couple of rounds, got bored a bit in the midgame and then wore out on the last round or two.

The cards themselves and the various special powers are unfortunately nothing special--just discounts on this or that, etc.

Too long for what it offers. Overall, pretty meh.

The main mechanisms of Spyrium are fun and fairly novel: adding meeples to the card tableau, switching over to removing them, and deciding what to do with them as you remove them.  Ok, there's a little bit of Tzolk'in in there, but mostly it was a different experience.  The rest of the game is pretty standard euro fare, and involved juggling two currencies and trying to improve your lie while gaining the all important victory points.  As a whole, the package works and I enjoy it, and would be fine playing again.  Though as a whole, there's nothing that particularly would call me to buy it or even ask for it by name.  It's a perfectly fine game that at least deserves to exist, which is more than I can say for most.

It's an okay worker placement games that reminds me of key flower but with less options. It is a very tight game. Too tight for me. I find it frustrating. Typically out of five worker actions you might be able to get one of the things you want. It has quite a lot of luck even though it is fundamentally a strategy game. The reason for this is is because people can take what you need and therefore you are caught out of what you need. This happens more often than not creating a game that is about managing losses and figuring out your probability of getting one thing or another.

Players mine a new energy source, Spyrium, and convert it into cash and victory points.  Players on their turn place workers onto "streets" formed by the placement of cards into a 3x3 grid.  Once they are finished placing workers, they can flip into "action" mode, to withdraw workers to either claim income (based on workers remaining nearby) or buy one of the cards and add it to their portfolio.  Cards grant abilities, which workers not placed, rather held back, can be used for.  The object is to run a cash/spyrium economy and turn that into victory points.  The game is played over six turns, and predictably, the cards scale up in power, and thus the engine grows.  

Thoroughly predictable game of place stuff to take stuff to turn stuff into victory points.  It's clean, it works, and we've seen it all before.

RATING: 6
One of the better worker-placement games. One of its strengths is the fact it juggles several mini-games at once: a push-your-luck game for who will forego placement and start reaping rewards, a positional outlasting game to grab resources, etc. 

Granted, I'm not at all a fan of this genre but this is by far one of the most playable ones :)

A relatively simple and quick engine builder. But one where you often have a plan, and then have to make lemonade when it doesn't go quite the way you planned. It's got a enjoyable economic system that doesn't bog down play.

RATING: 6
The primary mechanism of placing and removing workers on the "streets" of a 3x3 grid is mainly what drives this game.   You can never be sure that you will get the cards that you want, and you cannot be sure of the price either.   Coupled with a tight economy, that part of the game feels very much like Speicherstadt to me.   It has that same kind of tension and uncertainty, even though the mechanism is a little different here.   The rest of the game is pretty straight-forward.   Use workers to mine Spyrium, churn Spyrium into VPs.   One or two good Patents are probably essential to winning.  The uncertainty can be both thrilling and frustrating.

Love love love this game. Much to say but I will keep it brief as others elsewhere have commented much on this game. All there is to say is that I love the tension you get in the bidding, the tension in the use of your workers, the tension in the timing of withdrawal from the market, the tension in the various strategies that can be adopted, the tension in the lack of money, the tension in the bluffing in the market...in so many ways there is so much tension. Terrific game.

Spyrium was an instant hit for me with interesting gameplay and appealing artwork.  It takes an innovative twist on worker placement through the placement between rather than on cards and the variable costs/ income depending on number of workers surrounding a card.  Can't wait to play it more.

Wonder about replays after learning the cards.  (Perhaps new cards have been reserved for an expansion.)  Flexes nicely to handle diff nos. of players.  Like that the 'board' config changes to compensate for the fact that most of the cards are used every game (and many of them are similar).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[2 plays] This is an OK game, but I have figured out what annoys me about it the very most. It's the lack of titles on the cards. I didn't find out until I looked at the rules that all the tech cards and all the character cards have names. These not only add to the theme (which could use all the help it can get), but make the function of the cards more intuitive and easier to remember. But nobody ever knows, remembers, or uses them, because they're not on the cards!  Maddening. 

This game seems to vary a lot with number of players. With 3p we ended up with higher scores, but had a lot less money than with 4p. This is because of the clever way that in the market, other players both help you and hurt you. 

Both times I've ended up focusing on the residence track. This is most effective if only one person is doing it, as there are just about enough related cards to give one person a boost. Having to squabble for them with someone else might make it not worthwhile.

Elegant, clean, and tight. Perhaps the very definition of a dry euro. The theme could really be anything, but I like the artwork and iconography. There is a good amount of interaction since multiple workers can be placed on the same space. I love the dynamic nature of the placement and activation phases. This is a game i admire as much as I enjoy. No, it's not a replacement for Caylus. But it is worthy of being Caylus' little brother. For the price of a typical card game you get a med. heavy euro, what a value! Highly Recommended.

RATING: 6
I like the card-based, modular "board". That said, neither that feature nor the unique treatment of multiple meeples (activate at heavy cost or remove for cash) is enough to make Spyrium feel like anything but a mid-tier engine-building Euro.

A robust game here considering the 60 minute play time and that it accommodates 5 players. Besides the main draw decision point of “place a worker or remove a worker (and if so, for money or the action?)”, there are choices in the engine you build with the cards you acquire. I quite like the way you can move over into phase 2 out of sequence with other players and how phase 2 plays into the actions you take with the cards you’ve acquired.

Easy to teach and play, and could be used as a good gateway game. The price asked for the quality of components and depth of play inside this game is unmatched.

I appreciate the worker placement mechanic for buying cards. It allows the players to effect the economy within the game by increasing the cost of cards through clever worker placement. It's also awesome that players can choose to leave the first phase earlier then others. However, the buildings and characters are only marginally different as you advance to the later stages of the game and could cause this game to wear thin quickly.

Nothing especially new, except the additional cost or gain by counting meeples around a card. Other than that a nice, efficient worker placement Victory Point generator with rather dark graphics. Evidently steam didn't bring light.

The timing from 1st phase of placement to 2nd phase of using your meeples was nice, and I was surprised that the extra card actions all did have useful effect in the game. Nice that it's just six rounds and you see nearly all the cards. Nice plastic Spyrium bits. No diversity in the humans in the artwork either, which is getting to be a greater and greater disappointment.

Like some recent games (Tournay and Ginkgopolis), i wasn't interested to discover/play them and i find myself blasted each time. This is not different with Spyrium.

This is a brillant design, a big Ystari's game in a small box. There is enough room for replayability, interaction and decision here. I like what the game brings to us with so few components and easy rules :
1) timing (when to switch to activation phase, when to acquire technics if ever...)
2) jockeying
3) combos
4) race

The theme is almost here (at least, it is ok for me as i can see the theme relation of each building/technics) except for the events : i really don't see the thematic justification for these cards (i think they are here to balance the game although i am surprise that it is a free action/bonus --in term of action, not resources). Also, i was very surprised that the main resource is not the spyrium but the money.

To summarize, i can see the different thematic paths :
- go for mining and transforming spyrium crystals into VP.
- go for workers and make them work into mine/factories/laboratories or educate them.
- go for residence to accumulate money in order to buy the most expansive buildings in order to show to everyone your social success.

I find the idea of having only 9 era C cards interesting. This put everyone on the same level of knowledge, prevent to screw a strategy if the relative card is not drawn, focus the action and bring pressure for the last round.

Some signs show us that Spyrium is a very well thought out and tested game :
- no residence card on the last turn to prevent degraded strategies
- Taylorism in era B and not A like other technics
- always the same cards in the last turn
- the self-balancing for 2 players (no specific setup, see below)
- the crane seems less stronger that it seemed to me at first sight

It could be odd to not have any setup variation for the 2 players configuration but, on TricTrac.net, Ystari guys told us that they wanted the 2 players game to be very different from other configurations :
- some tech cards are less powerful
- some character cards will become useless after the first activation
- money is tight

All of this will entice you to interact because you have only one opponent and a perfect information of its finances.

I've been excited about a new game from William Attia (the designer of one of my favorite games - Caylus) ever since I heard it was coming.  Spyrium has a fascinating central mechanic that turns the geographical placement of workers into something that affects the cost of various cards that need to be acquired, with the added twist that I can longer place workers as soon as I decide to buy my first card in a round.  People that care about theme may want to stay clear, but I find this to be very interesting with plenty of room for exploration.

Akkor csak röviden: nekem is nagyon tetszett. Pont olyan nehézségű, amin már lehet agyalni, de nem fáradok le a végére. Picit a gateway fölé mondanána  nehézségét, egy stone age után mondjuk már simán tanítható. Az alapmechanizmus nagyon egyszerű, max. a kártyák értelmezésének útvesztőjében tud elveszni a kezdőbb játékos. 

A kártyák grafikája elég nyomasztó, de szép. Talán a tábla nézhetne ki jobban is. A kártyák szétválogatása nem egyszerű mert sikerült terepszínűre nyomtatni a hátán a forduló jelöléseket...

Tematika, hangulat nincs túl sok, a de mechanizmus magával ragadja az embert, szóval én most kivételesen nem is igényeltem különösebben.

Nálam 8-as a kezdp értékelése, ami fölé nem nagyon szoktam menni egy játék után.

Spyrium is a fairly generic resource conversion game. Most of the game seems to be in knowing which cards exist in the game and determining what the optimal conversion path is between those. There is a nice tension between using your workers to generate income in order to buy new cards or to activate cards to generate points but that fact remains that there is little else to the game. It's a raw little resource conversion engine put into a box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really fun mechanically game that doesn't make any sense whatsoever thematically. Why did they introduce a new resource into the industrial revolution? What does that accomplish for the concept of the game?

Anyway, the stock market is very fun, as is planning your strategy and stockpiling resources to fire your factories. One thing I really like is how end-game scoring isn't really a given, there are several ways of scoring points that aren't even possible in the last round of the game, such as the residence track. You might also not have enough spyrium or workers to do all you want to do. This contrasts witt a lot of euros to me in that several reward set collecting or some other kind of exponential scoring based on something you've built up over the course of the game. St. Petersburg had this. Those games overdo it. Spyrium still has a lot of exciting end game scoring, but it's manageable, and more importantly the chance of pace is much appreciated.

A really cool game with many subtle play options for what is really glorified worker placement x resource conversion. The theme doesn't do a lot for me, but that is fine, since it is barely glued on. Pretty though, very pretty. Like most worker placement style games, there isn't much you are actually doing - putting a worker on a board or taking him off, but the consequences of timing and placement are huge. I love how tense the game gets just by the amount of potential a well placed worker can add to the game.

Market-based tableau building game with a thin steam-punk theme.  The market is a great mechanism where the players vie to either leverage interest in the various cards for cash or to buy them.  It's an interesting trade-off that creates a lot of scenarios to work through especially as the various card alignments are random from game to game. It's a pretty standard efficiency engine game after the cards are purchased, but the purchasing is quite unpredictable so flexibilty in planning is required.

Easily one of my favourite games at this time. The worker placement and phase 1/2 switching is very interesting for me, as are the round bonuses and the numerous strategies that can be employed. I only knock off the .5 points because I've found that the random setup of the rounds (specifically with the A deck) can be somewhat frustrating, especially when none of the Patents come out, or if there are too many of the Character cards. I would still rather take my chances with Spyrium over most other games I've played, however.

On the fence about this one.  Takes the market mechanism from Hermagor and makes a beautifully crafted tight interactive worker placement game out of it.  Just, it seemed a bit dry - I didn't get the steampunk feel at all.  The jump to 4p from 2p gives just as good game with different dynamics - again the theme which should be a strong point doesn't come through well at all - eg played in same evening as Bruges - Syprium have better gameplay possibilities but enjoyed Bruges more.

Very good worker placement game from the designer of Caylus.  This game is different because you place workers between 2 card and you have 2 options when you take your worker back :
- Activate a card and paying the cost + 1$ for each worker adjacent to it
- Take 1$ for each worker adjacent to one of the 2 card
So the more a card is popular, the more it will cost to buy it (or the more money you'll get).
A player can start removing worker even if all their worker have not been place before a card he really wants gets too expansive or before someone else takes it.
What I really like in this game is that your strategy is constantly changing.  This game is unique because the actions you perform when removing workers are often not what you intend to do when you first place it.

Spyrium is an engine builder efficiency game driven by worker placement. There is one resource here, the titular Spyrium.  Everything in the game focuses on a conversion between a combination of worker, Spyrium, and money to create victory points. For an efficiency game, this is approachable. It is always easy to see a way to get one of the resources that is needed. Unfortunately, none of the engine building is exciting. There is little arc to the game. Money gets easier to manage as the game progresses, but as actions grow stronger and more capable, they have the feel of more work, not more fun. Placing workers in the market is, however, interesting. Workers are placed between locations and the cost of that location's action is dependent on how many workers are adjacent to that location. Since there is are no blocked spots, the choice here is how much to make a spot cost. I enjoyed this mechanic. It has depth and made for a full-feeling game that requires few components and table space. That said, Spyrium does not feel to hit a stride. It meanders, then comes to an end.

Place your workers around cards to either buy them or activate their power. Each worker around a card increases this card's price by one, and you can also remove a worker to get as much money as there are workers left around the card. Another interesting feature: placement and resolution phase are distinct, so you may pass sooner in order to get a card before your opponents. 
Good game in the lighter/shorter - optimization category.

The main feature of the game is the two-part action selection mechanic, with a soft worker placement phase before actions can be performed. Workers can be placed without restrictions between any two cards, but they increase the cost of taking or using those cards, and it's up to each player to decide when to stop placing workers and start performing actions. The rest is your run-of-the-mill resource conversion game: earn money, buy buildings and technologies, produce crystals and convert them to victory points.

The biggest flaw is that the game doesn't scale very well with the number of players. The main way to get income depends on how many workers are around some card, but the number of workers per player and cards on the table is fixed. Thus, money feels very tight with two players and still a little with three. Otherwise, there is nothing too wrong with the gameplay, but nothing very exciting, either. The theme is irrelevant, while the components and artwork are merely adequate.

Picked this up at a deep discount since I'm a Euro fan. Had let other more showy things get to the table first. We ended up being really pleased with the value to game on this one. The market mechanics were different that the other games we've played thus far, and gave lots of options for choices even in a 2 player game. There are better Euros out there, but this one had a neat premise and was a good buy. Also has a relatively small table footprint.

There is some interesting tempo stuff, but sadly the economy is not calibrated to exploit the one novel thing (placement and removal of meeples)--so what you're left with is mostly bog-standard engine-building.

A collection of fairly simple mechanics come together for some really intricate gameplay.  I really like the way workers can take actions OR generate income, combined with the way actions cost more based on demand.  It makes for an elegantly self-balancing market.  And the midgame bonuses throw a new twist into a VP engine game.

Spyrium is a lean, mean engine building eurogame with interesting mechanics and a new interactive mechanism.

No surprise that it comes from William Attia, esteemed designer of Caylus.

I really like the quick pace and focused action of this game, unlike Caylus the interactions have less blocking of others and are pointed more towards increasing one's own production, with an interesting timing mechanism offsetting timing and cost.

While Spyrium isn't heavy on theme, neither is Caylus, and it is long on play for its game length.

Definitely a keeper, in fact, more likely to hit the table than Caylus, I suspect

JEM Magazin 8. szám 2013. november:
http://jemmagazin.hu/magazin/

William Attia neve sokaknak ismerős lehet, hiszen az ő alkotása a híres-neves Caylus . Ez az a játék, amelyet az európai típusú játékokat kedvelők ma is alapműnek tartanak.  
Sokan várták már az új játékának a megjelenését. A Spyrium egy párhuzamos világban játszódik a viktoriánus kori Angliában. Ebben az elképzelt univerzumban spyrium egy nagy energiahatékonyságú ásvány, amely forradalmasította az ipart. A játékosok, mint iparmágnások próbálják ezen felfedezést saját hasznukra fordítani, hogy gyárakat építsenek, szabadalmakat szerezzenek meg, s így egy virágzó üzleti birodalmat hozzanak létre. Nem véletlen, hogy a játék neve ez a kitalált ásvány lett, amelybe belerakták az Ystari Games játékokra jellemző Y és S betűket, hiszen a játék kiadója ugyanaz az Ystari Games, amelyik a Caylust is kiadta.
A játék egy közepes méretű táblán, illetve a mellé helyezett kártyák körül játszódik. A táblán találjuk a pontozó sávot, a forduló eseményeit, egy lakóhely sáv mezőt (ami az adott forduló elején kapott bevételünket mutatja). A tábla tetején pedig az adott fordulón belüli két fázisnak a jelölése található. Ezekről a fázisokról később lesz szó.
 
A tábla mellett minden forduló elején 9 kártyát rakunk ki az 59 kártyából. Miután a kártyák hátoldalán A, B vagy C jelölés található, így a kártyák ebben a sorrendben fognak előkerülni. A játék 6 fordulóból áll, azaz a kártyák nagy része a játékban előkerül. Ezek a kártyák adják a játék lényeges elemeit. 
A játék ugyanis nagyon egyszerű mechanizmussal rendelkezik. Vagy munkásokat rakunk le a kártyákhoz, vagy munkásokat veszünk fel a kártyák mellől. Hasonlóan, mint a Tzolk’in-ban, csak itt a lerakás és a felvétel is egy fordulón belül történik. Három munkással kezdünk (maximum még négy munkást szerezhetünk), amelyek lerakásával kezdjük a játékot. A munkásokat mindig két kártya közé kell leraknunk, tehát a kártya oldalára, tetejére vagy aljára helyezhetjük az emberünket, a sarkára nem. Minden körben egy embert rakhatunk le, de bármikor dönthetünk úgy is, hogy már nem szeretnénk embert lerakni, hanem felvenni szeretnénk őket. Ilyenkor a táblán a jelölőnket az I-es, lerakási fázisból áttesszük a II-es, aktiválási fázisba. 

Ezt követően kezdhetjük el az embereink felvételét és három lehetőség közül választhatunk. Vagy kapunk annyi pénzt, ahány ember maradt azon kártya mellett, ahonnan az emberünket felvettük. Miután minden emberhez két kártya tartozik, így logikusan azon kártya után kapunk pénzt, amely körül több bábu van. A másik lehetőség, hogy a kártyát visszük el. Vannak kék épületkártyák, amelyeket az előttünk lévő kezdőlapka jobb oldalára tudjuk letenni, ekkor ki kell fizetnünk a kártyán feltüntetett árat, plusz még annyit, ahány bábu maradt a kártya mellett, és ki kell fizetnünk az építési hely költségét is. Az első épület leépítése ingyenes a másodiké egy font, a harmadiké kettő és így tovább. Megtehetjük azt is, hogy egy már lerakott épületre rakjuk le az új épületet, ilyenkor a régi épületet eldobjuk, de cserébe nem kell fizetnünk az építési helyért. Ha az új épület és a lecserélendő épületen legalább egy azonos jel van, akkor három fonttal kevesebbe kerül az új épület ára (de nem csökkenhet 0 alá).

Vannak zöld szabadalmi kártyák, ezeket a kezdőkártyánk bal oldalára rakjuk le és az ára annyi, amennyi a kártyán fel van tüntetve, amit megnövelhet a mellette maradó bábuk ára. Ezeknek a kártyáknak a lerakása – ellentétben az épületekkel – nem jár plusz költséggel.
A harmadik lehetőség, hogy használjuk az egyik szakember kártyát. Ilyenkor a munkást elvesszük a kártya mellől, de a kártya a helyén marad. A szakember használatának költsége a kártyán van, és ki kell itt is fizetni pluszban annyit, amennyi munkás a kártya mellett maradt. Néhány szakember használata a kártya kirakásakor húzott zsetonoktól függ. A zsetonok 1-es, 2-es vagy 3-as jelűek lehetnek. Ha zsetont kell felhelyezni – akár épület-, akár szakember kártyára – mindig eggyel kevesebbet rakunk fel, mint ahány játékos van. Ha a játékos felbérel egy szakembert, eldob egy általa választott zsetont a kártyáról és megkapja a megfelelő számú győzelmi pontot (Bürokrata) vagy nyersanyagot (Bányász) vagy befizeti az adott összeget (Építész, Bankár, Tőkéstárs). Ha már nem maradt több zseton a kártyán, akkor az ott maradt szakembert nem lehet többet használni. 

Továbbá az aktiválási fázisban használhatjuk a lerakott kártyáinkat. Ilyenkor elfordítjuk a kártyát jelezve, hogy az adott fordulóban a kártya többször már nem használható. Ha az épület hatásához szükség van munkásra, azt a kezdőkártyáról kell elvenni, azaz nem lehet olyan munkást használni, amelyet korábban már leraktunk és utána visszavettük az adott fordulóban. Ha spyrium kell a kártyához, azt be kell fizetni a bankba. 

Minden fordulóban egy eseménykártyát helyezünk a közös táblára. Mind a lerakási, mind az aktiválási fázisban lehetőségünk van ezt az eseményt használni (de csak egyszer). Ez egyrészt azért jó, mert az események mindig előnyösek számunkra, másrészt időhúzásra is jó, ha akár a lerakásnál, akár a felvételnél taktikázásból időt akarunknyerni. 

És ha végképp nem tudunk semmit csinálni, akkor passzolhatunk és nézzük, ahogy a többiek még akcióznak és várjuk a következő fordulót. 

A játék hat forduló után ér véget. A játék közben szerzett pontokhoz hozzáadjuk a megépített épületeken jelzett pontokat és a szabadalmi eljárásokkal szerzett plusz pontokat. Ahogy az ilyen játékoknál megszoktuk, a játék közben kín-keservvel megszerzett pénzünk és spyriumunk nem ér semmit (kivéve, ha olyan szabadalmi kártyánk van, ami erre ad pontot). A legtöbb pontot elérő játékos lesz a győztes. 

Nem tudom mennyire sikerült ezt írásban visszaadni, de a játék maga elég egyszerű mechanizmussal működik, elég gyorsan átlátható. A kártyákon lévő jelölések is teljesen egyértelműek, a játék teljesen nyelv független. 
Mégsem mondanám családi játéknak, mert minden lépésünknek komoly következményei vannak. Miután három emberünk van és azt legfeljebb hétre tudjuk felduzzasztani a játék hat fordulója során (az épületkártyákkal illetve az egyik forduló kártyával) így általában 20-25 lépésünk van. Ebből a 20-25 lépésből kell pénzt szereznünk, kártyákat leépítenünk és a leépített kártyákat aktiválni. Ha pár lépésünk ebből nem sikerül – például elviszik a munkásunk mellől mindkét kártyát – akkor kevés esélyünk van a győzelemhez, vagyis a játék eléggé tud büntetni. 
Összetettségében nem éri el a tervező William Attia korábbi játékának, a Caylusnak a mélységét, nem is lesz olyan alapmű, mint az volt, de azt kell mondanom, hogy megint csak egy nagyon jó játékot sikerült készítenie, amit az európai típusú játékokat kedvelők örömmel fognak a kezükbe venni. 
Az 59 kártyából 54 kártya illetve a 7 eseménykártyából 6 mindig játékba kerül, azaz elég hamar kiismerhetők a kártyák. Ennek ellenére elég jó az újrajátszhatósági faktora, mert minden játék más helyzetet teremt. Ami még ennél is fontosabb a játékot több féle módon is meg lehet nyerni, nincs egy fajta nyerő stratégia, hiszen például győzelmi pontokat lehet szerezni az épületek játék közbeni használatával, a szakember kártyák használatával, a szabadalmi kártyákkal a játék végén, a megépített épületek győzelmi pontjaival stb. Ezért érdemes kipróbálni több féle stratégiát is a győzelem érdekében.  
A Spyrium 2013. egyik nagy újdonsága és igen örömteli módon hamar a magyar társasjáték boltok polcaira került. Szerencsére az Ystari Games jó árképézésének köszönhetőn egészen elviselhető áron kapható a játék. Dunda munkásságának köszönhetően pedig már magyar szabály is létezik, amely a ketaklub oldaláról le is tölthető. Ráadásul a board game arena oldalán már online is kipróbálható. Persze mint minden társasjáték ez is élőben az igazi, ha másért nem azért, hogy a jópofa spyrium kristályokat a kezünkbe vehessük.

A simple engine game that doesn't outstay its welcome by virtue of keeping itself to six rounds. There are three currencies: cash, workers and spyrium. It doesn't pay to go too far into one at the expense of the others, so you really only need four buildings: extra worker, mine, factory and research facility, then over-build them as more efficient ones come out. I'm not sure there's a lot of replay value here as there aren't really competing strategies, but I did enjoy my one playing of this.

My love of Scythe has driven me to explore the purer efficiency eurogames that it was inspired by...and lo and behold, a brand new copy of this sat inexpensively on the clearance rack of my local game store. Just like going for the first-turn patent, this was definitely a solid investment. The dynamic asymmetry of having the option to forgo further placement and jump to activation really makes this one stand out, and will leave you sweating the decisions that should (for all intents and purposes) be simple.

The extra half-point had to be taken off for the less-than-intuitive symbol usage, which makes this game take longer to explain to a newcomer than it should.

RATING: 5
The game is a competition to make high efficiency by using resources. A unique mineral called Spyrium is a key point to make high victory point. Players use their limited actions and workers. As the game progresses, players achieve industrialization for victory. The aspect of the game is tough and tight. Players always feel lack of workers, money and Spyrium for making victory points. If someone who love to make strategic choices upon challenging circumstances, Spyrium is a good choice.

Very tight and relatively quick, I like this one. One nice thing is that I feel that if a player really knew the game well and was a master of optimising it, he/she could still get their plans knocked back by an early pull-out of another player's worker or something, I think this is nice as it levels the playing field a bit.

I can't help but find some similarities between Spyrium and its predecessor, Caylus. They obviously come from the same designer, so that's expected. Spyrium is definitely its own game though, and it plays very differently. Its method of worker-placement is sufficiently distinct to merit standing on its own. It provides difficult decisions and lots of room for strategic play. I don't think it's quite as deep as Caylus but I don't count that against it. If you like euro-style strategy games, then this one is definitely one to try out.

Players wrestle with each other on the board composed of cards.  No special skills are required.  If you play well, you should be fine and finish within of a few VPs from others.  Whoever comes out of the scuffle a bit luckier than others, wins.  Not my definition of fun.

Generally a disappointment barring the publisher (Ystari) and the designer (creator of 'Caylus').

I should play this again as I had too many rules questions when being taught... it may just have been that the teacher seemed to be winging it on remembering the rules and that the incorrect rules I was likely taught ruined the game.

for the bidding mechanism for cards... it's like Keyflower, though I think Keyflower obviously is a much better game

Extremely interesting worker placement game where your workers represent several different possible options. I love the balance of knowing when you need to swap from placing workers to taking workers back. The whole game is a see-saw of risk and reward where timing can be incredibly important.

I would like to see some more cards for the game though. A little more variety would get this one to the table a lot more frequently.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2015)

I finally played Spyrium. It took me a while but I always thought it could be a good game because I have  William Attia in a high regard.

Spyrium rules are easy to teach, but reading them from the game manual can be a bit harder. It is mostly a card game, but it is a good one.

The theme is pasted on (and boring for me). The art is ok.

It has interesting decisions (where to play my worker, should I use it for money or to acquire a cards?, should I pass?, Should I use the event?, should I activate a building?) and lots of replayability (due to the cards and the tokens) so the decisions aren’t obvious and it plays differently each time. The board is a 3 x 3 grid which changes every turn. 

The game can be slow (high downtime) with 4 players, so I think it is best as a 3 player game. 

For now I don’t have anything bad to say about it, I want to play it again.

Bottom line, Spyrium is a good game, it doesn’t feature anything groundbreaking but all the parts work very well together. It has a spot in my game collection and I want to play it again.

After more Spyrium´s plays I have become a bit bored by the game. Its gameplay is (somewhat) repetitive so I’m downgrading its rating. For now I will keep it in my game collection but Spyrium is not a game I want to play too often. However, I still recognize it  can be a fun game to play.

Spyrium is no longer among my favorite games of 2013.

RATING: 7
A strategic engine-building game with crucial tactical challenges. A first play indicates various different paths that could lead to victory as our scores were pretty close while choosing vastly different approaches. The paths are mainly determined by patents that give special skills and VPs at game end.

Mechanically, Spyrium recycles the market mechanism from Hermagor and implements it in a new way to either earn money or acquire the needed buildings, patents or prestige (together the engine). Two salient features distinguish Spyrium:
- There’s an incentive to collect victory points from the beginning by awarding an additional worker or gold when crossing certain thresholds.
- Players choose when to stop placing workers on the market and switch to retrieving them. This is possible as workers can be used to work in previously purchased buildings instead of competing in the market. An interesting asynchronism  between players comes into play as some players will already be buying cards when others are still setting up their position.

I enjoyed my play. Nice game, William!

Very dry euro that is easily holding it's own due to two things. Firstly the timing element of of your actions, i.e. when to move to the phase two and the choices you make during the phase two add some good old-fashioned tension to the game. Secondly, the whole market design with the costs based on demand is pretty brilliant. Combine these two dimensions and the game is nice tactical experience. On additional positive note the box is very compact. On the negative side the game looks very unappealing.

RATING: 8.5
Great twists on worker placement. The central mechanism rewards flexibility, and makes WP even meaner because if you take someone's action away, not only do you deny them, they also lost a worker. Sometimes you want to go where it's crowded, other times you don't. Money management is also Power Grid-tight. Solid gem. Expansion would make this go through the roof with added replayability and some more of those cool techs.

Couple of clever mechanisms make Spyrium more interesting than your average worker placement game. What prevents Spyrium from reaching greatness is that the cards bought during the game are incredibly generic, the kind of "use X number of resource Y to get Z points" seen in what must be hundreds of other games. Still a better and more streamlined game than Caylus or Caylur Magna Carta.

Spyrium is set in an alternate world, an England set in a steampunk-based universe. Players build factories, needing workers to manage the production of a commodity previously unknown to us called "Spyrium". Producing Spyrium in one factory, then processing it in the next results in victory points (VPs) for that particular player. Alternatively, Spyrium can be purchased, but the material is rare and expensive, and players are constantly scraping for money.

Only those who from the beginning of the game manage to increase their regular income or their base of permanently employed workers (who can be used again and again to raise money) will be flexible enough to get their hands on the important end-of-game buildings to generate many VPs.

Caylus designer William Attia’s game is definitely not a grand scale game like Caylus; I’d compare it more to Ystari’s Mykerinos (another game where you are collecting cards with an innovative mechanism of placing your markers at the cards in a few subsequent turns). The game is tactical and strategic at the same time (like Mykerinos). 
The mechanism is special, while the rest built around this idea is not that special; you are building your personal display just like in many other games of the past few years (even the three piles of cards marked A, B, C work just like those – cards in pile A can provide you easy conversions and some simple benefits, cards in pile B do the same but are significantly stronger, cards in pile C are mostly for collecting victory points).

It’s not the greatest game of all time - it's simply a very good game that is not too complex (but not for beginners either) and has many interesting considerations for your decisions – like timing (when to start taking your workers back; when to take money and when to take cards; when to take the special action available for everyone once in the round, just to wait to make a card cheaper etc.) and worker management (keeping some of them active – not using them at cards – so you can use your workers on your own buildings). As you have choices about what you can do with your workers when picking them up, you are constantly forced to evaluate the current situation at the given cards (as others might have made you change your mind). The aims are usual, the tools for reaching the aims are usual, the way and order you get the tools is not that usual. And it's the second WP game in the past 365 days that makes "taking back workers and executing the action connected to them" a separate action from the placement of workers (the other game was Tzolk'in and I found that one a bit boring). 
I also like that it works fine with 4 but is still rather good with 2 (a bit less competition for the cards, but then it’s a lot harder to get any money so you still end up around the same card with your workers). The game is not very thematic but that has never been a problem for me; what can be a bit of a problem is that it can get longer than it should if you play with AP-players.

After three plays, I find myself not really enjoying the game.  There seems to be only two primary methods for gaining points with a few other secondary methods.  If this game only took an hour with my group(s), I'd likely enjoy this more, but the AP levels can rachet up quickly.  As a result, I decreased my rating by one to a 6 and sold my copy.  The other players did enjoy the game, but they'll have to buy this one if they want to play again!  :-)  

Very abstracted design involving workers, spyrium resources, money, and three different types of cards.  The cleverness in this game is the 3 x 3 grid where one places workers in the "streets" to later claim the action of the person, build the building, or claim the technology that gives a permanent bonus the rest of the game as well as an end game bonus.  One can also withdraw a person from a street and take gold based on how many people remain around one of the adjacent buildings...otherwise, one always pays money equal to the number of workers around the card + the base cost of card + variable amount dependent upon how many buildings you already own.  Economy is relatively tight and the buildings increase in effectiveness in the 4-6 rounds.

"Spyrium relies on the players playing each other, instead of having it as one simple facet. The strategies in Spyrium are VERY narrow. In fact, there’s basically one: get mines to get Spyrium ore, get factories to process Spyrium ore for points, get workers to give you a more flexible board presence, make sure you get enough money from the worker placement situations out on the board to facilitate those builds. It’s a checklist more than a strategy, really, and it’s the player that balances all of that the best that will likely win. Spyrium is a finesse game, for sure, with players very much in each others’ faces vying for the better positions on the pieces for their point engines."

During the rules for this I was not sure how much I was going to like it, as it sounded like a lot of the same old. I was pleased to find that it's not; it does a lot of pretty interesting things. It's sort of worker placement, but with some neat ways the workers interact other than merely taking spots away. Also, like some more current worker placement games, you have options on when to activate the workers, so there's some nice timing elements in there. In addition there are bunches of ways to try to win. There's a lot to like here.

That said, halfway through the game, though the box lid said Asmodee on it, I knew I was playing a game published through Ystari. There's a look-and-feel to most Ystari games, and Spyrium has it. That includes the fact that while there are Ystari games I like, they just don't have staying power. Yspahan, Mykerinos, Metropolys, all games I like, but all just don't get played. Spyrium is so close to being a keeper, and I might trade for it or pick it up cheap, but I don't have confidence it would get enough table time to justify owning it.

When I first read about Spyrium I was interested but hesitant simply because it seemed like a novel mechanic and not much else. Color me impressed after my first play.

As the game develops you have several major avenues of vp generation and within each there are multiple combinations. This alone kept my interest, but it's the further tension and pressure of the worker placement mechanism, what I thought was the lone novel mechanic, was what really helped tie everything togethers. It's not just a vehicle but a true strategic element.

What I think I like the most is that the game is uncluttered; it's unfettered by the other layers of false strategy some games try to pile on in the name of complexity (I'm looking at you Vinhos).

I REALLY like this one. Way to go William, way to go.

A medium to light worker placement game with some clever mechanics. Place workers between a small tableau of cards and the cost of those cards goes up.  You can pick up a card for money or pay the full cost.  A simple "economy".  The game is relatively quick to play (60-90) based on number of players.  I am not keen on steampunk themes but this one was fine.  

A game that would be good for older (12 year old) kids.  It is not that complex but has some good choices.

What a great compact game this is.

It feels like an abstract game, but there is a theme tucked away under these very smart mechanisms.

Sure, this is again a, "optimize your engine" game, but a compact and smartly implemented. No superficial elements. The game plays fast and is interactive. And despite what you might think about the limited amount of cards, since they show up in a slightly different order, and the tough competition for them, every play will be different and you need to come up with other strategies. Going extreme is certainly a good idea in this game. 

I hear you say, "but its just a bidding and worker placement game". I agree, but this game plays so fast, it feels like it isn't.

Knowing which cards are in the game gives you a competitive advantage which could be seen as a minus. 

This is a fun little game with simple rules and enough depth to excite the experienced player.
A lot of game in a small box.

Am i sensing an expansion already?

Games that have a very strong script for the development – here implemented via a stacked deck – are a bit hard to judge after a single game, since that first go will necessarily be more of a learning game. Nevertheless, I saw enough to be intrigued, and having the opportunity to play in a round of experienced players, I could at least witness, if not actually participate, in a tense exchange of strategies and counter strategies. I also came dead last, which speaks well towards the importance of skill in the game.

So this is an original, nifty game that offers a lot of depth. What kept me from becoming more enamored with it is probably the lackluster graphics and weak theme. Still, I’d certainly be willing to play again to find out how much the game improves if you know its arc beforehand.

I normally LOVE engine building games.  However, this one is very basic - you spend your time converting Spryium and money into VPs.  Comes across as kind of light.  I was expecting more interesting decisions.  There are some decent ideas in this game that I would like to see expanded on, but for now I'd rather play Keyflower.

RATING: 7
I think that Spyrium is one o the lightest worker placement games that I have played.  I say this as a compliment.  I was not expecting great things when I first played this game, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Much of the tension in this game comes from *when* you decide to move from Phase A to Phase B, which is just a brilliant mechanic.  Allowing everyone to bid on certain locations, and then up-pricing them as a result works very nicely as an automatic balancer.

I also really like that you don't use every card every time.  This is a big thing with many new games that I have noticed.  Don't include all components every time, that way each game will be slightly different.  This works nicely in Agricola for Occupations/Minor Improvements, it works nicely in Russian Railroads with mechanics, and it works nicely here.

I liked this game enough that I bought my younger brother a copy for Christmas.  It's a compliment to pick up a game for yourself after playing it with friends, but it's a HIGH compliment to buy it for another person.

RATING: 7
Egy (a közelgő zárórára tekintettel be sem fejezett) játék alapján még nem tudok teljes véleményt írni, de elsőre nem volt rossz. Ami biztosnak látszódik, hogy 5 fővel (kezdőkkel) elhúzódhat :) Érdekes és számomra újszerű a mechanizmusa. Érzésem szerint a fixen fokozatosan növekvő értékű (nagyobb előnyt biztosító) paklik néhány játék után egyhangúvá tehetik a játékot (a'la 7 Csoda), bár ezt ellensúlyozza, hogy egy adott játékban nem kerül egy adott pakli minden kártyája játékba, tehát egy picit minden játék más lesz. Ami még érdekes kérdés, hogy a patent (zöld) kártyák mennyire képviselnek domináns stratégiát? Érzésem szerint ezek a kártyák nagyon erősek (persze nem önmagunkban, hanem egyéb kártyákkal kombóban), szóval viszonylag fix stratégiának tűik, hogy néhány zöld kártyát be kell szerezni a jó eredmény eléréséhez. Szintén érdekes kérdés az ideális játékosszám. Emlékeim szerint a játék fix körszámos, ugyanakkor minden játékosszámnál mindenki 3 munkást kap, tehát pl. egy 2-3 fős játéknál jellemzően kevesebb lesz az egy körben lehelyezett munkások száma, mint egy 4-5 fős játékban, így jellemzően kevesebb lesz a potenciális bevételforrás, ugyanakkor a kiadási oldal csak részben csökken: az épületek vételára és helypénze változatlan, csak a szomszédos munkások száma miatt fizetendő felár lesz jellemzően kevesebb. Mindent egybevéve érdekes játék, szívesen játszanék még vele.

Placement of workers around the cards instead of on the cards is neat as the number of meeples around a spot affect your income (benefit) and the price of a building (cost).

You need one play to fully get it and the theme is perhaps a little dry. But personally i find the gameplay fascinating and completely compensating for these few points of critique.

The game is highly interactive without the opportunity of completely sabotaging other players voluntary. In essence it is a worker placement game but the way it does this is very elegant. This is a game you need to play to experience how exciting and puzzling it can be. I like it that almost no luck is involved but every decision has an effect on the other players, certainly when more players are involved. With two this is less competitive but you are dependent on eachother to generate more money.

Lovely game from a master designer. Some people were disappointed when this game failed to reach the complexity or scope of Caylus, but that wasn't the intention. It's a slick light-medium game with a clever system allowing individual players to move from a worker placement phase to a worker activation phase at their own speed. That timing tension coupled with the "crowding" tension that either punishes by raising prices or rewards by raising income makes the game replete with interesting decisions. It's a delightful engine builder that plays in a short time and is easily taught.

Extraordinary supply-demand economic mechanic hidden in a smaller worker-placement game.  Love the fact that the game IS small (table space-wise).

However, on the whole, fantastic game (really cheap, too), and I'd love to get it lots more plays.

Well, I'll play it again since we aborted our first play, but let's be honest: Spyrium is yet another dime-a-dozen resource conversion game. This time, you are converting money, workers, and--here's the big difference--little green plastic jewels ("Spyrium") into Victory Points. No food, barley, gold, or cows here! The initial placement is essentially an auction in which you get paid to retract a high bid. Once you buy a building, it goes into your own personal tableau, where you alone can use it, Homesteaders-style. The random setup adds to replayability at the expense of strategy, since you never know what cards will ultimately come out over the course of the six rounds. If you like Homesteaders, Caylus, etc., then this will be right up your alley. For me, it's yet another game I'll probably have to get used to, but am not going to get super excited to play.

The great mechanic is the way the workers are placed, not on the cards but on the intersections of the cards... and the timing to go to the next phase to start retrieving workers to get more money or the card you really want...

Very clever game, very easy to understand but it requires mental power to build a point scoring engine...

Like it a lot

I played Spyrium at a local games meet-up with four other new players of whom only one had skimmed the rules. I was a bit apprehensive at first as I was worried we’d make a dogs breakfast of the game as no-one had much of an idea how to play. Pleasingly, we picked it up pretty well and didn’t (as far as we could see) make any major mistakes. Even better, the game played really well, the mechanisms meshed nicely with each other and offered consistent challenging decision making.

The game itself revolves around managing scarcity. The theme of the game is that players must manage the production of the rare (and hitherto-unknown) element of Spyrium and convert them into victory points. To do this players manage their scant labour force and meagre finances to get the best result while other players are also jostling for limited resources and opportunities. In the one game I played all players opted for some pretty different strategies and I came equal first with three building (which I just used and used and used) while my co-winner had something like seven buildings and one or two advantages in play which suggests there are multiple paths to victory.

The game itself was really well designed – I really liked the way the discretionary to switch from the placement to the activation phase worked – and offered challenging choices as well as being a lot of fun I can see myself playing this again if circumstances allow. I’ll look out for this one as a possible purchase.

Interesting, unusual, but dry game, with zero thematic flavour despite the nominal steampunk setting: it's an abstract worker placement game. Something of a bookkeeping exercise, in which you try to juggle limited resources (workers, money, spyrium crystals) and convert them into points. Worth playing, if you're into heavier strategy games, but a difficult game to love. If you like Tournay, you'll probably like this (as yet another headache-inducing game based on activating a 3x3 grid of cards), and vice versa--but this is the better game, far more elegant in its mechanisms.

FURTHER THOUGHTS 21 Mar 2017: I really like so much about the basic principle of the game (it's like a 2-dimensional Speicherstadt: adding workers increases the cost of a card, but also adds to the money obtained by just removing them). But it feels frustrating that there are basically two paths to victory: one is very complex (assembling all the necessary resources: workers, cards, spyrium, money) and one is brainlessly simple: max out the residence track and keep grabbing 7 points a pop. It's true that competent opponents will prevent the latter strategy from succeeding easily, but it still feels like a game lacking in a balanced variety of paths to victory.

Spyrium has a very simple economic model where workers are used to generate resources (spyrium) which in turn are used to generate victory points. What makes Spyrium unique, however, is the clever market model where the players place workers next to the cards they want and where every new worker increases the cost to take that card. Hence, the important part of the game is not to build an efficient economic engine but rather to build it so efficiently as possible by taking the right cards in the right time.

William Attia hasn't disappointed us. While similar mechanics have appeared in Hermagor (the queue-up and get adjacent tiles) and Keyflower (use the tile adjacent to your workers and possibly purchase it), it's still very thought-provoking. The dynamtic between players is very strong, and while you need to plan ahead, prepare to change plan.

The game has very easy rules, and with its short game lengths, it is quite a handy game for gamers. It's dry and very cutthroat in nature, though.

In this worker placement game, players place workers in the space between cards in a 3 X 3 grid. You can then choose to take off the worker for money, equal to the number of workers left beside the card, or you can buy/use the effect of the card for a certain price, added to it the leftover workers adjacent to the card. 

The theme is in 20th century England, and a new metal called Spyrium has been found. You either build buildings sucn as mine or factories to generate spyrium or VPs. You can also buy patents which give you bonuses during play and at the end.

You play over 6 rounds, and each round there is a certain event card which influences the game (get an extra worker, for instance). 

This is a fun, thoughtful and well designed game. The mechanics are simple, and the game very replayable. You are always tense whether someone else will leave taking a card you want and you have to trade off getting money or VPs. This game forces you to be precise, since getting money might be a better play in the early going.
This is a really elegant game, and I am looking forward to more game designs from William Attia.

Thinky worker placement game that introduces the idea of spaces becoming more expensive as demand for them increases.

I love the mechanism in this game where you put your workers in between cards.  Once you start picking them up you can decide to take the card action, OR you can get money in the amount of different workers that are there when you pick up.  This dynamic is really cool because you want to go where it's popular to get money, but than you also want the popular cards before it's not there anymore.

There is also your play area that allows you to buy inventions and buildings.

Spyrium is the big currency in this game that will get you big points.  There are plenty of other ways to get points as well, as there are opportunities for clever play by passing early on to get that desired card, and to use the special cards that are usable by everyone once a round.

workers are placed between cards. after worker placement comes worker pick-up. worker pick-up is the way to get money or buy cards. cards may bring more workers or income and could produce spyrium or VPs. this is a typical euro without anything particularly interesting going on.

You can see the theme in the cards, but that's about it, because the game is abstract. It's a very open worker placement game, with 2 phases that can be simultaneous: placement and activation. The greatest virtue of the game: it offers plenty of different ways to victory; there are many possibilities with each move, you will combo cards and actions in also different ways. And even if the game theme focuses on Spyrium production, you can win without it.

On the other side, the graphic design is lacking. The symbols are fine, very intuitive, and most illustrations are also OK. But that's all. The box is directly ugly, almost as much as the small game board and the card backgrounds.

But what I liked the least is what comes with the game being so open: the AP and the long time between turns. The situation changes a lot, especially in the placement phase, and you ned time to reassess your options. As they say: great power comes at a price :p


[b]Conclusion:[/b] very smart economic and original euro with many, many paths to victory, a horrible graphic design and some AP.

The basic system is very appealing but I'm worried about the cards: There are so few cards that almost every one of them is included every time, and the card effects are very similar to each other. This makes me feel that the replayability and variability is far more limited than it should be, and players may start relying on standard opening moves rather quickly.

Based on 1 complete game: Very solid worker placement mechanics with some innovation. Different paths to victory. Many strategies.  The Steampunk Setting is a joke. The Artwork is crap. The game has deserved much better artwork. With better artwork the game would easily get a 9 or 10.

Gioco di carte con meccaniche interessanti. Tra i punti di forza anche la semplicità e la durata contenuta. Con molta attenzione i giocatori dovranno cercare di ampliare i propri edifici, fonte di ricavi con l'obiettivo di ottenere entro fine partita più punti vittoria. Fondamentale sarà la produzione di Spyrium un nuovo minerale che potrà essere utilizzato per avere ulteriori punti vittoria. Il gioco risulta da subito molto stretto, pochi lavoratori a disposizione, pochi soldi per poter comprare quanto serve e poco Spyrium. Mettere in moto la giusta strategia per produrre queste risorse si rivelerà molto complesso perché la partita dura solo 6 turni e ci si accorgerà presto che sono molto, troppo, pochi. Un gioco avvincente che ha anche nelle dinamiche delle originalità come la metodologia di acquisizione delle carte. Per poter acquistare una carta, infatti, si dovrà posizionare un proprio lavoratore tra la carta stessa e un'altra carta e successivamente la si potrà acquistare ma pagando anche una tassa dovuta a tutti gli altri giocatori interessati a quella carta. Alternativamente si potrà guadagnare denaro pari all'interesse. Sinteticamente trovo il gioco valido e interessante.

Worker placement (again, sigh) but with some interesting twists (yay). First lets get rid of any static board and provide a modular board made up of 9 cards, and refresh it each round. And instead of placing meeples on the cards, you get to place between two cards so you can choose either, or choose neither card and take money equal to the number of meeples around a card that you're next to. Neat. And lastly, let's give people a chance to shoot early. You place your meeples in turn, but can stop and start retrieving them before you've placed all your meeples, meaning you can pre-emptively claim a card, but at a cost in that you don't get as many meeples out. And in another neat idea, a card costs an extra dollar for each meeple next to it, so the demand for a card helps decide its price. So there's lots to like. A downside is that all the cards are variations of the same thing ... get spyrium, get income, convert spyrium into VPs. So despite the variety offered by the changing boards, I have a suspicion that the game will end up samey-samey, otherwise I'd be rating it higher as it was certainly enjoyable and interesting to play. The other downer in the design was that 5th player has a hard road, being last to place and last to start retrieving (unless you shoot early, but there's a cost to that as well), meaning you don't start the game well and there's no compensating mechanic. Except that you start first later when more powerful cards come out. But if you don't get your engine going early, cheaply, you have to hope for dregs that are decent. Other than that, certainly worth exploring, even for those who are jaded by worker placement.

This game has the distinct honor of being the first steampunk game in my collection.  You really have to time this one right; when to gain resources and when to spend them.

Based on one play: This has an interesting mechanic in which cards are placed on the table and you can play your workers between them. When you decide you can then switch to activate mode and buy cards or trash cards for money. But each player will switch modes when they want. However it seems like there are few ways to make points, so would have to try it again.

This has an odd place in my collection in that I don’t often feel like getting it out to play, but every time I do I really enjoy it. The workers being placed in between cards and then consequently being used to buy cards or make money, both being affected by the number of workers left behind is just fantastic and the timing between switching from placing workers to retrieving them is so simple yet so enthralling.

Compared to many games the engines you build are very small and have to be super efficient, it can be quite hard when you first start playing this as over stepping the mark can hurt you really badly. I feel that this is a good thing in the long run, but early on it can be brutal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Parts of the game are a tad bland (turn in x resources for y points), but the market economy driven by player placement near cards is fantastic. When to transition from placing workers to retrieving workers is often a brutally tough decision. It may never reach the pinnacle of Caylus, but this is a very solid game in it's own right.

In this worker placement game, you're placing your workers in-between cards, and later pulling them off to claim those cards (or performing the abilities on them).  After you start picking up your workers, you can no longer place any more, but your opponents can keep placing until their pull their first one off.  To take a card, you not only have to pay the cost of the card, but also the number of other workers surrounding that card--the economy is very tight, so there's a lot of angst here.  This system feeds a somewhat typical economic engine game driven by the cards.  I liked this quite a bit, there are a ton of agonizing tactical decisions to be made here.

Almost a filler but quite deep for what's in the box. We screwed up a few rules which broke the game and I lost horribly because of it. I'd love to play this again and I think the sweet spot might be 3-4 players for all the extra interaction. Money is super tight in a two player game.

Played it again, but still only with 2. Much better with the correct rules, but man is everything super tight. I would really like to try this with 3+ players as I suspect this will be even better.

Update: With 3 players, the gameplay improved immensely. I rather enjoyed it, but it did feel a bit mechanical. I'd easily play it again, but I'm not dying to get it to the table.

Spyrpium is an interesting take on the worker placement mechanism. Players place workers [i]between[/i] cards and pay for a card based on the number of workers adjacent to it. This process leads to a bit of a game of chicken wherein the timing of placing, recalling and buying becomes very important. Spyrium also features a solid enginge-building component. However, I do like me engine-bulding game to be just a bit longer. In this case (and to some degree in Keyflower), just as I’m starting to get the engine going, the game is over. It’s a solid game. Not one I’ll request, but I wouldn’t mind playing again.

If you designed a game like Caylus, I can imagine it's hard to make something new, as everybody will compare your new design with Caylus. William Attia certainly took his time before he releasing something new after Caylus Magna Carta. And for me it was worth it. It's not the 'new Caylus'. But you feel that the design is polished, there seem to be no overpowered cards or combo's and it feels like is more then enough playtested to just work as it should be. 
The putting down meeples between cards is a nice feature, feels a bit similar to the mechanic used in Hermagor. The entire game you'll have to make interesting choices (wait an other turn hoping to have a greater return/cheaper price with the risk that someone else grabs it?) an that's the type of game I like to play.

This game made a bit of a splash (in popularity) when it first came out, but you don't hear too much about it any more.

This is a good game, but unfortunately the placement of workers is similar to one of my favorite games, Keyflower. In Keyflower, when someone buys a tile out from under you, you get to reassign the workers you spent on your losing bid. In Spyrium, the mechanic is similar, but your workers are just lost, as it's a Caylus inspired aggressive play.

I had high hopes for the part of the game where when you are done with phase 1, you can get a jump on other players by moving yourself to phase 2, but it turned out to be fairly minor in terms of it's impact. What it amounted to was that a player can get a bit of a one turn jump on player order if they are willing to bid on cards less and use effects on cards more.

RATING: 7
 With your workers you get more workers, money or the raw material spyrium. The nicest aspect of this game is the bidding mechanism. At your turn you can place a worker next to a card, or once you decided that the placing workers phase is over for you, you may take the workers from the places and they then can generate cash, pick a card and count the number of workers adjacent to that card and take the same amount of pound sterling. Or you may buy a card and then you have to pay the cost of the card plus a pound sterling for each worker that is adjacent to that card.
This leads to a very tense timing in the game. If you do not want to pay too much you may find your workers useless if both cards where that worker was adjacent to are purchased.

Nice card game with a pleasant flow. The artwork looks nice though I am not too fond on the steam punk theme.

Really impressive small box game. I really like Ystari games anyway, and this one was tight and quickly accessible. Lots of different strategies to consider, and each one can be successful. Do you go for the long-term play that nets you lots of VP at the end, or smash and grab VPs as you go? Best bet seems to do what others don't.

I really like the income revenue move (I initially thought it too abstact) where you remove a Meeple and gain one pound for every other Meeple, including yours, surrounding the card.

This is a very tight game of worker placement/management. It seems like there's plenty of valid strategies, and winning isn't just a matter of knowing how to build the best engine out of your cards, but knowing how long to let your meeple sit around before activation. You might miss out on something really important if you're too stingy with your money, but then again, you might intimidate an opponent into spending enough cash to give you an advantage at a later turn. It's a nice level of player interaction. I am a tiny bit worried about the replay value presented here, but the game mechanics seem very open to expansion. That being said, there's a lot of game here for such a small box.

Quite clever in how the game uses the activation phase, and how this adds tension to a different part of the game besides the auction (though people may not perceive it as such that is what the 'worker placement' part of the game is).

It is however a bit repetitive and I suspect pretty chaotic with 4 or 5 players (I have played only at the 2-3 player count).

I don't know if I like the game that much, if I was able to play it regularly with experienced players I think I might enjoy it quite a bit but unfortunately it is one of those where you really have to have all involved playing at their best to get the intended gaming experience.

Pretty basic Euro of finding the most efficient way to earn victory points by building cards that work together - it moves along fairly quickly and with experienced players should play quite fast.  I really like the mechanic of choosing when to stop placing workers on the board and start activating them - do you wait one more turn and risk not getting the building you want, or do you pull the trigger now and have one or more unused workers? A couple minor gripes - the rules don't do a great job explaining how turns go - the explanation of placement phase vs. action phase is pretty clunky, but easily fixed with a good teacher.  Also, I really wish the player cards had been bigger boards instead of cards, with spaces to put the workers that you have not yet placed vs. the workers that you have placed and pulled off the board, and places to put the activation chips before and after activation rather than just above and below it.  Even better, player mats with slots to the left and right (with rising cost indicators) for your techniques and building.  $5 added to the price to make these would be worth it.

Perhaps the "trading resources for victory points" mechanics that are at the bottom of this game are old and tired. Maybe. But the auction gimmick is very clever. And there is an exquisite timing element to the game as well. Deciding when to jump to Phase Two, when to stall, these are painful decisions...the fun kind of painful. It is rare that I like a game with the max player count (I like shorter playing times). But this game shines with 5 players, works okay with 4, and suffers with less.

It's a fairly elegant little worker placement game, with the twist that you place workers in one step so they can take either of two actions, but any number of workers can be placed there, and then in a second step you remove your workers to either take the action and pay extra based on how many people are there, or don't take the action and get paid based on how many people are there.  Extra workers aren't as useful as they are in other games, due to the timing aspects of it, but you can buy cards that let you do things with your spare workers.  Graphically, I feel like the designer said "Hey, coal is black, which is boring, and makes for hard-to-see icons across the table.  How about we make it bright green and call it something else?"

My cup of tea, middle weight, clever mechanisms, beautiful artwork, scales well with all player counts and highly interactive. More to come after a couple of plays.

Gameplay: 7

Score is tentative (2plays). I like the different ramifications of a simple worker placement, very similiar to Bruxelles. You have to think about different things each time one of your dudes is placed. For example: How much demand will I create here and how such demand affects building price, income generation, and timimg because you don't want to miscalculate and get left out like lonely idiot lol. I like the events (although I wish there were more than 7). I like the cost of land per building space unless you build over something, and if it's a simillar type, a nice little discount awaits you. I like the patents and how they give you a special power and and end-game focus. The need to push up your rent income is also a big part of the game, since that'll dictate your beginning round revenue, but can also yield you vp's when you use a residence card. Juicy stuff, so why am I not in love? Hard to explain really.. But I am more than willing to play it more and discover more layers. Let's see, let's see. Btw, the game is quite Thematic imo, all of the mechanisms make perfect sense to the subject matter. I don't have a problem with the steampunk movement and I think the decisions to go with green pieces called Spyrium, instead of some boring good ol black coal was an efficient one. I think the design begs for this to be played with 3-4p, the interaction wasn't very high with just 2. Each player can sort of do their own thing and the supply and demand feel is sort of lost. That effectively makes the money in 2p games super tight, and it becomes quite difficult to buy expensive buildings.I imagine the interaction with higher player counts should be sublime. 

Update: Increasing score by 1 point. This is a very solid game for 2p, just a different experience to what it would be with more.  I'll comment more after I play with 3.

Update: Bumping up to a 9. This game is excellent. It's so elegant and has so many layers of depth when you get deeper into it. Pure excellence. Components are solid.

I can't understand why it's not more popular, it completely lives up to the expectations I got for the first in years game from the author of Caylus - I think I even prefer it, although it remains to be seen if it will age as well. Simple rules, difficult decisions, scales well, pasted-on theme and an original mechanic - exactly what one would expect. I love the 'push your luck, with no real luck' aspect, where every turn you have to decide if you want to keep sending your workers for greater benefits/flexibility risking that others will snatch what you want first, or start cashing out before other players with the workers you already sent.

My wife and I tried William Attia's Caylus for the first time this year and really like it a lot. And we have now played Spyrium multiple times. It's quite good, but not quite as good as Caylus.

I really like the bidding-type rules in the way you play your meeples, and it works quite well with 2 players and perhaps even better with more. You can also build a little resource/points engine, or go after some long-term, end-of-game scoring opportunities. It's a fairly dense game in a short time frame. Definitely a winner.

Played once with 4P. A light-to-medium weight Euro which has a clever grid-based Dutch auction system to prop it up. The more workers are standing around a card, the more a card costs, but players may also use such a situation to their advantage by pulling their worker out and grabbing some much-needed money. The rest of the game is decent, with a bare-bones engine building mechanism incorporated into the game. Players generally have to carefully balance their workers, money and spyrium to do well in this game.

Pretty much a generic euro-with-one-clever-mechanic.

Played at GenCon 2013.  Interesting worker placement card game with a couple unique twists.  The game is a somewhat abstract since the theme is only thinly applied, but that's fairly typically for Euro games like this.  There's a lot of complexity in a small package at an attractive price point.  However, the game can feel a bit long due to the amount of analysis that can be involved in determining the best play.

Attia játékához nagy várakozással ültem le, de csalódnom kellett. Egy kőszáraz, igazából egy ötletre épülő játékot kaptam. Sokszor szoktam írni, hogy a kevesebb néha több lett volna egy-egy játéknál. Nos a Spyrium esetében pont az ellenkezőt éreztem, ez így nekem nagyon kevés volt. Attia ötlete, hogy a fordulónként lent levő 9 kártya mellé helyezzük le embereinket és utána ezeket kétféleképpen tudjuk felhasználni. Vagy elvesszük és annyi pénzt kapunk, ahány másik ember még körülötte van vagy magát a kártyát vesszük meg annyival drágábban, ahány ember van körülötte. Ez egy teljesen jó ötlet, de ennyiben a játék ki is merült. Egy spyrium nevű anyagot bányászunk, ezt lehet különböző kártyák segítségével győzelmi pontra váltani és ennyi. Ez az egy út van a játékban, illetve egy bevétel meghatározó sávon nem csak pénzt, hanem győzelmi pontot lehet kérni. Ez a másik út. És ennyi az egész. Nekem ez túl száraz, túl egyszerű így. Működik, de ez így lapos és úgy érzem kb. 5-6 játékalkalom után nekem sok újat nem mutatna. Nagyon, nagyon messze van a Caylustól.

Really not all that impressive. The bidding mechanic certainly is interesting, as you can also make a bunch of money from a highly desirable position, but can have it swiped out from underneath you if someone is willing to pay the price. However, beyond that, I just didn't feel myself getting all that drawn in. It just didn't seem to have quite the same build-up as other games in the genre.

This is a pretty cool worker-placement resource-management type of game, with a neat placement mechanism I've only seen once before, at the airport on the way home from GenCon last year when we'd run into the designer of [thing=130499]Stones of Fate[/thing]. If you end up liking that mechanism, you should check that game out on [url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosmicwombatgames/stones-of-fate?ref=search]Kickstarter [/url], or the [url=http://www.cosmicwombatgames.com/Stones_of_Fate.html#Stones_of_Fate]publisher's website[/url]. Of course, the games went in very different directions. This is a pretty meaty game that gives you a lot to think about!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players start with some money, spyrium tokens, and workers. Each turn, players first collect income. Then, create a market board: 3x3 grid of cards (different deck each round of the game). Players take turns either placing a worker in the spaces between cards, or going to phase 2 when they can start retrieving workers. When you retrieve a worker, you either earn one money per other worker there, or
- pay one/worker to use the character card (for VP, or more workers, spyrium, etc.)
- pay one/worker + card cost to buy a technology card; place in your tableau
- pay one/worker + one/building you already have to buy the building card and place it in your tableau
You can also use one of your buildings (to earn VP, spyrium, etc.).

When you get to 8 VP, you either get another worker or 5 money. When you get to 20VP, you get the other thing.

After 6 turns (three with era 1 cards, two with era 2, one with era 3), the player with the most VP (earned during game, and from values of cards purchased) wins.

This little game has a surprising amount of depth and a lot of really interesting decisions.  It is essentially a worker placement affair where players' workers are placed in between two cards on a 3x3 grid, giving them access to either card.

Where the depth comes in is there are so many little factors to consider when placing workers and when actually using them.  Each worker placed next to a card makes it more expensive to use that card.  But you can also take the worker back without using a card for that amount of money.  Sometimes you have to leave workers behind to use cards you've already acquired.  Even when to transition between the placement and activation phase is another interesting decision you need to consider.

Don't let any of the above fool you though, this is still a reasonably simple game to teach and therein lies the problem with it.  Don't get me wrong, I love it when reasonably uncomplicated games offer a lot of depth and interesting decisions and can be played quickly.  The problem is this game can't really be played quickly.  First of all, you need large player numbers for this to work well.  The game is all about competition and the push/pull of where to put your workers and when to use them.  With fewer than 4 this competition diminishes and with it a lot of the interesting decisions.  However with that number of players and the number of decisions the game length is way too long in this game for what it is.

The rules are easy to teach and understand but the number of decisions lends itself very easily to long, AP turns.  Multiply that by 4 or 5 and you've got a game that takes 1.5+ hours that is more suited to less than an hour.  If I'm spending that much time on a game I would like a meatier, more fulfilling experience.  I really do like the balance of depth and ease of entry with this game but the time it takes is a bit of a deal breaker.  I would still play it, as it's a good game, but I don't think it fills a needed spot in my collection.

RATING: 6
Worker placement game where you place your workers between cards and the cost of the card is the card cost plus number of workers around the card. Beyond how the workers were placed, this was just a standard get resources (including pretty green gems!) and convert to victory points. There are more innovative worker placements then Spyrium. It's not a bad game, just not overly innovative.

RATING: N/A
I was expecting a bit more of heaviness in the new Attia design but, even with this fairly medium game I think the game has some depth. Cards tend to get a bit too much repetitive and I would rather prefer a game changer for the last (maybe) 2 turns, giving more 'salero' to the strategy.

Worker placement with a twist! What makes Spyrium different from your typical worker placement game is that when players place a worker, he or she simultaneously picks two spots, rather than only one. However, the spot is not immediately utilized, but can be challenged by other players who also want the same thing. In this lays an integral press your luck element as well as an extra layer of player interaction.

Spyrium is a very clever, stupidly-named, graphically lovely, Euro-style game that provides players with a rich decision tree and an utterly forgettable play experience (at least for those of us who appreciate at least a smidgen of theme and narrative in our games).  For my money, the game is chock full of clever and very lacking in fun.  However, those who enjoy typically "Euroy" optimization exercises will likely love Spyrium (the game, not the... what exactly was Spyrium meant to be, again?).  I'm not trying to bash the game design; it's just not my style.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 7
Players place workers between cards laid out in a 3x3 grid; when workers are removed, they can either take cash equal to the number of workers left adjacent to a card, or use its ability by paying it cost plus one for each worker adjacent. The result is an agonizing game of timing -- buildings and characters get cheaper if you wait, but another player might get there first.

Attia's other ingenious mechanism here is that players switch from the worker placement phase to the worker activation phase independently -- one player can start using their workers while another is still placing theirs. This has interesting implications for both timing and the value of workers.

The rest of the game is essentially about acquiring money, Spyrium and victory points, and/or converting Spyrium/money into money/Spyrium or victory points; it goes beyond "pasted-on theme" and into "utterly soulless". But mechanically it is delicious enough for that not to be a huge concern: the values of these simple cards are hard enough to gauge, and the timings difficult enough to manage, that anything more complex would be too much in any case.

[2013-09-28] GERMAN Ich finde es ganz nett, denke aber, viele werden enttäuscht sein.

Es hat für mich auf keinen Fall das Durchhaltevermögen etwa von CAYLUS oder PUERTO RICO, die ich heute noch gerne Spiele; bei SPYRIUM stellt sich bereits nach 3 Partien bei mir eine gewisse Gewöhnung ein. Ich weiß schon, was ich wann machen muß - welche Gebäude ich unbedingt kaufen müßte, und welche für die anderen Spieler wichtig wären; allein, ob es dann gelingt, hängt davon ab, wieviel Arbeiter ich gerade habe, wieviel Geld, und wann ich dran bin. Das gute ist, dadurch spielt es sich recht flott, der Nachteil für mich bei so "raschen" Spielen, das mir das Gefühl fehlt, mir wirklich was aufzubauen. Es wurde ja schon angemerkt, daß es sehr abstrakt ist, aber es ist außerdem noch kurz, bevor man seine Punktemaschine richtig am laufen hat, ist schon wieder alles vorbei.

Als Gegenbeispiel noch TZOLKIN, wo ich bei um die 20 Partien noch nicht so ganz sicher bin, ob die "da und damit gewinnt man immer"-Aussagen nun stimmen oder nicht.

Sicher kein Fehlkauf, aber ich bezweifle, daß wir davon nächstes Jahr noch reden werden (damit meine ich nicht "heute in einem Jahr" sondern "in drei Monaten").

Imaginative but limited worker placement game with a spurious steampunk theme. Players are attempting to build a number of buildings which award victory points and help produce spyrium the imaginary 'commodity' used in the game. Spyrium is processed through built factories to yield further victory points. The game turns are divided into two phases, one where players place their workers next to tiles, the second where the workers are removed and buildings activated. When removing the workers, players have to decide whether to take income, based on how many other workers are adjacent to the card, or whether to purchase it/trigger its effect by paying the amount depending on the other adjacent workers. The driving mechanism of the game is well designed and feels fresh, especially considering that this is yet another worker placement game. The gameplay is however limited by the relatively small set of cards available, and the steampunk theme feels completely tagged on.

Yet Another Soulles Euro. Found myself drifting away during rules explanation. So totally generic this one. Worker placement? Check. Building your own tableau giving you small extra advantages? Check. Actions that anyone can use? Check. Slight variations in the environment? Check. No theme, no soul, drab artwork? Check. No direct player interaction? Check. Playing the whole game knowing it is only the end that REALLY counts? Check.

Pfff, why do games like these still getting made? There are SO MANY Euro games already out there. So much BETTER Euro games. And even having theme! Pass, pass, pass.

RATING: 8.5
Very much enjoying Spyrium currently.  The decision space in a short time frame is wonderful.  The decisions are not hard and definitely based on experience.  I feel there are many ways to go about a win.  So far I have tried something different each time.

You are always a dollar short but it's ingenious to have the ability to forsake an action to make money.  This leads to well played plan A or Plan B situations.  The events help out to mitigate shortfalls or boost a strategy a bit.  I like how the characters can be milked for much needed boosts.  

The Techniques can really guide you and give really nice abilities throughout the game.  Grabbing a late one gives a nice surprise bonus for all your hard work.  

The 8 and 20 point bonus is a great mechanism to plan for.

I'm not sure if it will wear out it's welcome but so far I can't see anything stale because of the 'just enough' randomness of the layouts.  The spread is always going to be different but there are many options to pursue each turn given you can time it correctly.  It is wholly played out through player actions.  This mitigates any random advantage.

Theme: The most 'steampunk' thing about this is the cover.  And that barely qualifies.  It just looks like Victorian England to me.  Spyrium is just green coal.  No gears, no clockworks, no goggles, no steam really anywhere.  Some of the workers look a little like they are flying planes rather than mining.  So if that theme turns you off you'll never really see it in this game.

[thing=18602][/thing] is kind of the quintessential strategic gamers game. And I rank it very highly. And it certainly raises expectations for anything [person=5629][/person] puts out. But I tried being realistic and approached this game with as open a mind as I could. Otherwise there was but one outcome: disappointment. And we don't want that, now do we?
This game has a very solid 'auction' (but not really) mechanism in which you pay more of you want to claim something valuable, or wait a bit longer but risk someone else snatching it from under your nose. And it kind of reminds me of the market system in [thing=25224][/thing]. But the similarities are superficial as it plays out very differently.
But one good mechanism alone does not make a great game save for some notable exceptions. But this game also offers meaningful choices, different strategies to explore and it doesn't outstay it's welcome. All in all a very solid game, maybe even a great one, but it's too soon to judge.

This didn't feel like it added anything I hadn't seen a hundred times before. Collect coal, convert it to points, buy extra workers if you want, collect money to do stuff. Yawn.

While it's perfectly decent, I'd be shocked if anyone remembered this in 2 years time.

An enjoyable game that emphasizes timing. However, I can't help thinking that it feels similar to many other resource conversion games. Knowledge of the deck is necessary for skillful play. At the very least, there is real competition for resources. I like a little meanness in my worker placement games. Definitely warrants another play.

Enjoyed my initial play of this, but need to see how much staying power it has. Conservative rating of 7 to begin ... but looking forward to seeing if Spyrium has enough staying power to rise in my rankings. Update: I now have some concerns that the best strategy in Spyrium may be to ignore spyrium entirely and just push the money track to the top and then pump it for points.

Interesting variation on the worker placement: You place on a border of two actions and can pick either when you collect the worker, except if your opponents removed this card already. There is almost always the risk that your worker cannot do his job because someone else was faster, or that your planned income shrinks significantly when the others collect their workers faster than expected.

I'm 3 plays in and I'm liking it more with each play. For a game that has such a small number of rules, it has a ton to think about. There are good combos that can come up in the game, and plenty to think about with every single action you take. 

I'm keeping my rating at a 7.5 for now, because I see one possible criticism: it feels a little restricted by the number of cards. I'm going to be wanting a little more variety in the future...I think. This game is ripe for card expansion packs. And if I keep playing it, I'll be ripe for buying them.

I'm also happy with out it played out with 2 players. I'm hoping my wife will be able to get over the iconography learning curve and find a game that I really think she'l enjoy if she gets past that first step.

Glad to have it.

[b]::UPDATE:: 3/15/14[/b]

Ash played her first two games tonight and I'm going to give it a bump in my rating for being Ash-approved. She likes that it can be played in under an hour. It really is a game that packs a lot of interesting decisions into a short play time. That's a really good thing.

The funny thing is that I tend to win my teaching games, but then I lose my second game against people I teach it to. Either I'm a really good teacher, or I'm not very good at the game that people pass me up in skill level after their first game.

I really like it. A lot of game in a relatively small box and short play time. 

The only I hope for now is an expansion that adds a new element or two. Or at least some new cards.

Congrats to the designer for creating a deep game with easy rules.

It's a fun lite game, with a flawed card. Capitalization is broken. If the card comes out early enough in a game there is nothing you can do to stop someone from getting it for cheap and using it to easily make back the cost of the card and more. From there they are off to the races. It's unfortunate. I would play the game again, but knowing it's a broken game.

Of the few new games I played at GenCon '13, this was my favorite. The board being made up of cards, and the mechanism of changing from worker placement to worker activation being decided for each individual player makes for endless variety and a challenging new puzzle to solve every game. Above average player interaction in this thinky Euro, in the form of deciding when to pull the trigger on a building or tech purchase and thwarting the plans of others.

A brilliant take on worker placement. I can't find anything bad to say about this game, other than possibly that it is very hard to play well. Oh, and they should have just skipped the whole steampunk thing. It doesn't add anything to the game. Just replace spyrium with regular coal and everything would be fine.

RATING: 7
I had actually bought this game and then gotten rid of it unplayed as no one I knew was interested in it.  I finally got the chance to play it and I ended up liking it.  

It's a Eurogamer's game where you are converting resources to victory points and not much else.  I actually love the main mechanic of the game which is that you place workers around cards and then later you pull your worker off to trigger the card but paying an extra buck for every worker bordering the card or you just don't trigger the card and get a buck for every worker around that card.  Knowing where to place workers, knowing what everybody else wants, and deciding when to switch from the placing workers phase to the pulling workers phase makes the game incredibly interesting.  

Unfortunately a lot of the game is figuring out if spending one worker and a crystal now for three points is better or worse than spending two workers and a crystal for five points later... or other equally exciting decisions.  So a lot of the people I know won't enjoy it because of that.  And the one person I usually count on to play dry themeless euros just doesn't like this game.

RATING: 7
I liked [thing=137269][/thing]. It is a well done game, with a myriad of options on each turn, a good dose of interaction (in positioning the meeples and in buying cards), and loads of timming in doing actions. The workers allocation and use is very different from the usual fare and separate [thing=137269][/thing] from the common place in the genre.

The variety is big, considering the random order that the cards come and also in relation with the order of the Event cards. Yet, since the building cards are divided by phases, is possible, with experience, prepare for what will eventually appear and set up strategies to make the best of what the future holds.

The pacing of the game is great, with fast actions, quick resolutions and the direct use of the buildings, events, positioning of meeples and actions (remove a meeple to gain money or buy a card adjacent to a meeple). A play, in 3, will last around 45 to 60 minutes, and from 60 to 75, in 4 players.

Overall, [thing=137269][/thing] is a game with few problems - maybe is a little too dry and mechanical (hey, this is from the same designer of [thing=18602][/thing] after all); or, even with the variety, it can became predictable. But I don't see these issues are truly problematic or severe. I enjoy the game for what it delivers in proportion of the effort it requires - a pretty good relation, considering the duration of play, choices, variety and pleasant interaction. Approved.

This game has some wonderful mechanics. At bottom, it's an industrial-themed engine-building game with a bit of worker allocation/placement thrown in, but what really makes it shine is the auction phase each turn that leads to tense trade-offs between the competing critical needs of buying properties or patents (special abilities) and the need to obtain more cash with which to do so. The ability to switch phases independently of other players also plays an important role. I very rarely win at this game, but I love to play it. :)

Though nothing new is added to the game mechanistically, this game is nonetheless quite pleasant to play and has a decent amount of player interaction. At the core, Spyrium shares many mechanics with other economic engine building games where money buys spyrium (the mystical resource) and spyrium can be converted into victory point. To round up scoring, there are buildings which score victory points and also end-game "contract/patent" cards that score victory points on different variables. The game revolves around the timing of action selection. Players decide where to place meeples to earmark purchasing building, engaging services to procure goods or earning straight victory points. Once players are satisfied with the earmarks, they can flip over to the execution of these orders and the timing of the flip is essentially a critical part of the game. Price of each action is dependent on how many meeples surround the card and hence, is dependent on collective player actions around the table. Waiting makes the action cheaper, but the action may no longer be present as other players have claimed the action. This to me is the interactive portion of the game, and likely the most crucial. The remainder of the execution phase is mainly to trigger conversion of money or spyrium into points from activation of buildings.

An engaging and relatively cheap game with a modicum of player interaction. While theme is virtually non-existent, it does not detract much from gameplay unless you detest the steampunk genre. Spyrium can easily be considered as coal, wood or heck, even karma points.

worker placement. actions aligned in 3x3 grid.

then later you can activate the worker to get money (more per adjacent worker) or buy the card (costs more per adjacent worker).

This is my understanding of the archetype for euro-games. Didn't excite me but it is a clean design and I will play this more as the playtime is not too off-putting and it has some originality in the putting out/activation phase mechanic. The main sin from my point of view is that I will be able to suggest games I would rather play for any occasion. This I think comes from the fact that this game is pretty much an optimizing game that is played with thought rather than feeling. This results in the game feeling dry and not that much fun even if some number-crunching optimizers might go off wildly for this one.

light worker placement game with a learning curve (knowing what cards might come later is important), 
nothing very exiting but it works. best with 2-3p in my opinion.

[+] tight resource management (workers, money, spyrium), interseting decisions (when to start activation phase, get money first or buy card first, ...), good balance of strategy and tactics
[-] no theme, replayability (feels same-y after several plays), more cards and events would be nice...

(Aug 2013 after 1 3p game)   Had this one on my radar and glad I got to play it post Gen Con.

Worker placement game with an engine building mechanic and multiple ways to score points - count me in.

3 card types - personalities, buildings and skills - nothing was too overpowered and it all felt very balanced.

6 rounds of game play (3 A, 2 B and 1 C round).   It always felt like I wanted to just do everything, but couldn't.   I like that kind of tension and decision making.

One game so far. Engine building game with worker placement and couple of other mechanics. The game is not very intuitive, there are lots of mechanics and the theme is pasted up. It looks good, except the light blue tokens, which do not fit the game look at all and they cover the pretty graphics on the cards.

Players try to gather spyrium (mythic mineral) and workers, then convert spyrium with workers to money and points. The game feels ok, but it just has so many different things and they are just combined together without any logic. Lots of similarities with Caylus (Magna Carta). I believe I will play this couple of times, but not necessarily more.

After the second game I might say, that the game is not so complex as it felt for some during the first game. Not an instant hit, engine building with worker placement is not probably my thing.

Third game under my belt, this was the first time with correct rules. :) Now with three players, who were all veterans, so the game was rather quick. I still don't know how to play this game to win... Ok game, but I'll probably pass if I have a choice.

JC Lawrence pretty much sums up my feelings on the game: "An absence of anything to find interesting". 

The worker placement/removal mechanic is ostensibly the centerpiece, with the rest being painfully generic resource conversion, e.g. I can buy the building now that lets me convert 1 worker and 2 gems to 5VP, or I could wait for the building (maybe) next round that lets me convert 2 workers and 3 gems to 10VP, or I could just use this one-time card to convert 1 gem into 3VP... yawn. 

The problem is that the worker placement/removal mechanic just isn't that interesting or challenging. Playing online against expert players who scored higher than I even thought was possible, I realized that their advantage over me wasn't some greater skill at managing the worker placement, but rather a better understanding of the resource conversion system. I've no interest in learning the efficiencies of this particular spreadsheet, thanks.

Spyrium is very reminiscent of Keyflower and clearly, there was some inspiration here in the way the auction by area majority works. The game is fine. Utterly, perfectly fine. The problem is that it does nothing to rise above that. I don't know if it is the generic steam punk theme or what, but I just can't bring myself to care about it. What is Spyrium? Who knows? It's just a resource you trade in for points, 3 to 1. or 5 to 1. Or you buy a building, and score a few points that way.

Who cares? This game has literally nothing to say, which is a shame because I think the underlying mechanism is pretty good. Had it been first to market, it might have been special just because this style of worker placement auction is so interesting. But Keyflower gets the innovation trophy and tells a far more interesting story to boot, so I see little reason for this game to exist.

Love this game but it feels too samey as the cards dont change in the deck. Order the cards come out changes yes but the card decks dont have enough variance to make the game feel challenging. In the end my wife and I find it to be more of a race to the top and that is a weird feeling for this game.

Admittedly I rarely play with more than 2 so perhaps this game shines with 4 or 5. But for me the lack of card variability is a killer for 2 player.

Nothing expecially new or entertaining in this game but there are a couple of good mechanics that push you toward interesting decision (do i take money or cards? is it the correct time to pass to phase two of the turn?). So even if the game is not of my favourite type (too many combos and things like that) it does give a good playing experience and i can be convinced to play it again. 
Not as fast as i would have liked it: in the last turns there are many meeples around and the rhythm does slow down a bit.

It's different, and different in a good way. I like how popularity determines the cost of your worker, but can also net you more money if you aren't as interested in the options around your worker. I need to play more to see if it's sticking around, but if nothing else it's a small game and cheap by comparison.

Clever worker placement game with the twist that each player decides for himself when to shift from placing workers to using placed workers for actions.  There seem to be multiple ways to win.  It's all engine-building, but different engines seem to work.  Excellent scaling with my plays of 2, 3, and 5 players all working very well.  Clear iconography.  Excellent presentation.

-- Sold: 10/5/17 - Pretty fun little WP. Small footprint and simple rules, but the theme/presentation just wasn't enough to keep us wanting more.

Enjoy this. Nice little strategies that do not take too long with a six turn max.

At first it seemed like a light bidding / engine building game, but money is soooo tight that players have to calculate and recalculate a lot. Well made game, but a bit too heavy for my tastes.

A fun game by the designer of Caylus.  This reminds me a but of Keyflower in a way.   Keyflower similarities + Caylus designer= a very solid game.  A lot of strategy to be has but it really could use an expansion with more cards and options.

Note:  Sleeved with Fantasy Flight Standard Gray Pack

cool worker placement-ish game with a spatial element to the placement... workers give money or get cards or use powers... costs and pay-outs depend on the amount of workers nearby... pretty cool!

Competitive.
Player interaction - Unique. Fun. Allows blocking.
Strategy - Optimization. Somewhat Versatile.
Replayability - several times.

Still one of my favorites for the depth, playtime, and amount of interaction. The lack of exciting theme doesn't bother me usually but if that matters to you than this isn't for you.

The engine building in Spyrium is pretty basic.  Use workers and resource A (Money) to get resource B (spyrium) and turn it into points.  However the interesting worker placement/spatial auction coupled with finding the right time to stop placing dudes in action phase 1 and start using them in action phase 2 feels really unique and you can't help but feel proud when you get a working engine out of the bidding rounds.  Its small travel size and pleasantly thinky gameplay are a good combination, but this never got to be a favorite so I ended up trading it away.

Interesting bidding game with some clever mechanics.  One play was 4 player and one was 2.  The 4 player was more fun, but the tight nature of the two player version may appeal to some.  Not bad for the price.

Good light worker placement game.  Not an intro game as some of the mechanics are hard for someone new to worker placement to grasp.

A light, six round worker placement game with some interesting mechanisms and clever money generation/push your luck purchasing system.

A good amount of game for such a low amount of components and price. Recommended.

RATING: 7
A great strategy war game. Plenty to think about and do. And it changes depending on who you are and how many players. Have played with three and six, three was more concentrated, with each of us attacking each other all the time. With six there was a lot more diplomacy and planning involved, especially as I was Prussia and was attacking and being attack from all sides. The downside with this many players is there is a LOT of downtime and it is a VERY long game, we played for three, maybe three and a half hours and didn't even finish the second year of a possible five or six (I don't remember). A very good thinking game, but when you actually get to the battles all power and strategy goes out of the window as the object is "try and roll a six!!!", still very good, but be prepared for a full day of serious gaming!

RATING: 7
Seems okay, could definitely use some support from the designer and publisher (like going on CSW and answering questions).  Downtime isn't terrible, but the single year campaigns seem to be pretty uneventful thus far.  Will revise rating after I play full campaign sometime.

An excelelnt job on the components, except that they messed up the mapboard by not lining up the edges correctly. But visually a VERY attractive game.

Gameplay is good, if uninspired. Victory conditions....need some work. Not sure I ever got that "feel" of a Napoleonic game from it that I was hoping for.

Soldier Kings is a recreation of the 18th Century world-wide conflict we know as the Seven Years War. Play feels like a cross between a newer GMT card-driven, point-to-point game and an old-school hex-and-counter war game. The object of the game is for players to conduct diplomacy (both in pursuing team and self interests) and to manage a balance of resources and manpower with the the goal of expanding their particular state or empire. Production values are high, but I found the map and counters a bit complex and busy. While the rules are straightforward, it would likely take at last seven hours for a full table of experienced players to get through the entire war. In the hands of an experienced club with a long Saturday ahead of them, it should be great fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Beautiful game. Great period flavor and ambitious scope. Also translates well to miniatures play for use with "Might and Reason". My only beef with the system is the the ability of Navies to affect Land Combat by too high a factor. In fact the phrase "throwing guineas at windows" [i.e. wasteful expenditure for too little results] was after British naval raids on the French coast during the SYW. 
Same bad mechanism appears in 'Soldier Empreror'.

In the pimp up and modding state for my risk figures and ideal playground. Who needs all these counters, when to play in 3D? The two Maps of the colonial countries are now mounted on thick cardboard. realistic Armies taken from an old Risk game, instead of the tiny counters.

RATING: 6
Too many ambiguities, a hideous map, and a real lack
of grounding in history. Still, a fair framework for some
AT style play - if only the damned thing were a cleaner 
presentation. As it is, probably too much effort (feels
more of a pain than Empires in Arms for example) to play.

BoD system does not help it one bit. Multiple rounds of
die rolling just kills the fun value. 

Paying for attacks though is inspired. This could be
a treasure if cleaned up. Unfortunately, even the player's
guide, which tries to add some historicity to the situation,
ends up just creating more rules questions. 

Should not have been published in the condition it was though.

The conters are standard Avalanche fare, the map is cluttered, too bright and is difficult to read informations. The rulebook is awful. The game is unplayable in the 2 players version, the more you are the better it gets with 5-6 being the best. Still I don't recomend it, play Napoleonic Wars if you like light multiplayer games.

This was a fun, not too heavy multi-player game.  The components are slightly garish, but the system works well for a lighthearted group gaming experience.  Movement is point-to-point and there are rules for both land and naval combat which is resolved using the "buckets of dice" mechanic where a roll of 6 (or sometimes 5 or 6) is a hit. Units are 2 steps for the most part.  Leaders (generals and admirals) enhance movement and add to your dice total in combat.  Diplomacy and economics also figure prominently in the game.

There were a few ambiguities in the rules but nothing major and certainly nothing a "gentleman's agreement" couldn't settle.  There was certainly enough for each player to do without too much downtime (even with 8 players) however if you are Britain or France, you will be busier.  A complete campaign will take about two sittings for first timers (or if your group is "chatty" like ours) but with familiarity and a little focus could probably be completed during the course of a long day.

Yes it seems to be a good game, it's just a good concept. I love the "world" seven years war, but there is problems about rules (about minor coutry alliances for example) and about counters (numbers and power of army/fleet, generals capacity...), but in the end, it is a sympatic game. I wonder what can it be with 8 players.

Although the rules are very poorly written, there is an interesting game here. We are going to play again next week.

Besides a multiplayer 7 year game (28 turns), there are 7 1 year scenarios (4 turns each). The first one (Prussia vs. Austria) is an excellent learning scenario. We will play the next scenario next week which is 2 major countries vs. 3 major countries.

It takes a bit of getting used to. There are no "fronts," a la WW2. Armies can march around with almost impunity. It does show a lot about troop quality. You need high quality troops to attack with serious casualties. However, you need lots of low quality troops for garrisons. 

You really have to plan. It costs a lot of money to attack and money is scarce. You also have a short campaign season as winter can be brutal.

After a second play, I really enjoy this game. But, to be played right, you need 7 players and a long weekend where everyone commits to 2-10 hour sessions. With the Napoleonic version, you may get away with 5 players, having minor nuetrals of Prussia and Austria.

RATING: 7
Never got to play anything more than the 2-player scenarios of this, and only a few times those. I wish there was a VASSAL module for this - it's difficult to find players otherwise. But the diplomatic and operational systems seemed quite interesting and I think would shine with the full complement of players.
I've recently been playing some of the one-year scenarios solo, which are good fun and don't take long to finish: the fact that the game only lasts a year really pushes both sides into attacking and making as much progress as possible, while still paying attention to the economic factors which are really the core of the game.
Some strange rules: I'm not convinced by the idea that sieges should be harder to prosecute if the attackers enter through a mountain connection. But it hangs together nicely.
Oh yeah, and it has one particularly amusing abbreviation: the "Royal Betrothal" card event places a marker which reads "Royal Brothel".

RATING: 7
First ever wargame on the worldwide Seven Years War.  I prefer this one to the subsequent S&T game on the same topic, although this one has its share of problems.  On the plus side, the game uses the excellent A House Divided system with some good additions, such as naval units and sea zones, event cards, fortification values (you have to attack the space as well as the army), and separate tracking of manpower and money.  Negatives include some spotty production values, Britain is favored given the exaggerated ability of naval units to participate in land combat, leaders die way too easily, and there aren't enough new leader cards.  House rules have fixed some of these issues for me.  However, the quirky combat system, which encourages some gamey behavior and produces some odd results, is a definite drawback.

A decent game with great potential.  Unfortunately, they needed to add in some player aides and clarify some of the rules a bit better.  Any game that is playable by up to 8 needs stuff like that to keep it moving along.  Even the simple aides in a game like Civilization make a world of difference.

RATING: 5
Disappointed by the quality and appearance of the components; the counters are fine, but the 2 maps are printed on rather flimsy paper and the artwork is colourful but crude, there are not enough dice, and the quality of the cards is poor (reminiscent of games from the 80s). The rules are of only moderate complexity but the rulebook is poorly written; to be more precise, the poor English and lack of clarification leave a number of rules unclear. This isn't a major problem but detracts from a game which would be playable out of the box if only Avalanche had paid attention to writing and editing. As it is, the game does work as a relatively simple multi-player wargame but it is rather uninspiring. Also, there are two elements to the game which I really think need to be improved: the formation of minor alliances is a hostage to the luck of the card draw, and indeed the whole card system adds little to the game.

Nice map, nice counters, and I like the global scope. Unfortunately, the rules are unclear on many important and often needed matters, the playing time is far too long, and there is massive downtime for the non-active players. Also, both the scale of the map and the mechanics are too "zoomed out" for the period. When Prussia and Austria each consist of three spaces, there is too little opportunity for maneuvering.

RATING: 6
A flawed game, but also a fun game with some good ideas.  I have only played it as a 2-player game.  However, I have all but given up on the 2-player game as simply too unbalanced in favour of Britain - Prussia.  Expect it would be better with more players.   

Interesting time period and I like the inclusion of economic and manpower rules.  Not a complicated wargame, yet the rule book is remarkably weak.  House rules are required to fill in gaps in the rules and fix some game imbalances, particularly with the naval rules and the minor country production rules.

Luck can play a significant role in the game.  Soldier Kings is driven by the event cards and the “4-3” units.  Event cards range from useless to game changing.  Unit strength ranges from “1-1” nuisance units to the near indestructible (without the help of the right event card) “4-3” units.  The disparity in unit effectiveness means that loss of one of these “4-3” units and/or some unlucky unit construction draws can seriously effect a nation’s fortunes.  Not a bad game.  I would very much like, but don’t expect, to see a 3rd edition of the game.

An world wide rendition of the Seven Years War from Canada to Europe and India. There were too few spaces (Holland was one space, Prussian six I think) and too many turns (seven years of monthly turns).

Despite certain elements that I find a bit disconcerting--ability of fleets to use full attack power in land combat, dearth of minor alliances active at any one time--Soldier Kings seems to capture the realities of campaigning and shifting alliances in the mid-18th century. Limited warfare. I like the cards, but the rulebook has some ambiguities that would become a problem if I did not play solitaire. Lacks historical feel and color beneath the surface, but it's a good intro or beer & pretzels game with a group. 

Plus Potato War.

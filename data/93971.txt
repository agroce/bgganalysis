RATING: 8
Plays very quick, which is why it's likely to keep hitting the table. It's almost entirely luck-based though, which is why I can't give it a higher rating. The art is gorgeous though, and there are enough crops to create the most beautiful version of Pit ever!

EDIT: After a year, I'm bumping this up to 8. It consistently hits the table and provides a wonderful filler game or experience for non-gamers. It also becomes more strategic the more you play it. Highly recommended.

Excellent, multi-faceted card game of set collection, well-timed "melds", and luck of the draw to score individual points from said "melds".  The Nile DeLuxor version (as opposed to the predecessor, Nile) adds 2 new crops, allowing up to 6 players, and a stone resource to build monuments which provide special powers.  Interesting/strange Knizia-esque scoring and all done at game end, but play is quite fun!

Just a fun card game with decent interaction. The monuments give it that little bit extra. My biggest negative is the art style; it's almost depressing. I like the game best with just two. When I played it with four, it was frustrating to me that I was blocked from playing so many cards. The core mechanism of harvesting the flooded crop is very clever. Harvesting improves your "score", but it also makes it easier for your opponent to plant the crop you just harvested. I find that trade-off very interesting.

Nile is a light card game with a modicum of set collection and a dash of take that play. The luck of the draw is a significant factor in this old Egyptian farming game but since the seasons come and go very quickly that is quite appropriate.

However, even though the game claims to support up to 6 players, it doesn't really scale all that well. The more players you have, the more you are at the mercy of the cards. With more than 4, play consists mostly of wishful thinking and about half of the time, you're not even invested in what the other players do on their turn because your own fields have already been harvested or pillaged.

Definitely better with the stones, but while the game is entertaining, there is virtually no player agency. In every game I've tried so far, it's less "do I build X or Y?" but "well I can only build this one thing, so I might as well", with attempts at trading the flood generally failing to produce any useful results. 

Forums suggest option of playing 3 cards to re-flood (instead of 2), and the third card controls new flood type.

To rephrase: if you want a deep and heavy game, this ain't it. If you want something fairly mindless to wind down with, it's perfect.

Nile DeLuxor is one of those games which seems like it's over before it's began, but in that time, you'll probably be enjoying yourself with the quick and easy gameplay.  One of the players stated that it was just a sort of nothing game, and when I thought to defend the game from that statement...well, I really couldn't.  But all games are pretty much nothing.  And for me, this "nothing" was pretty darn enjoyable.  I think it's one of those games which everyone should have to introduce their friends to gaming.

This was on my Essen 2011 watchlist but the high price for a card game of 20 EUR got me thinking. After playing, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. It's a completely fine passtime, it has nice graphics but there's nothing compelling or at least interesting to explore here. Even for filler standards, it's shallow in its decisions. Might be better with only two or maximum three players.

I really enjoy this game and it seems to offer some very interesting strategic play.  The art is simple, but very functional and appealing.  It's not overly complex to teach, but does require droning through a list of rules which, fortunately, quickly began to make sense within a round or two.  The scoring is also interesting and forces some careful planning.

RATING: 7.4
1. It's short, and has relatively little downtime. 
2. I suspect that like Bohnanza this is a game that only brings out the knives when played with card-counters. 
3. Simple rules, relatively big implications. 
4. Yes, luck (and the pushing thereof) has a big role -- the timing of the annual locust infestation, the draw of the flood cards, the cards you draw -- but these are all things to be managed. 
5. Unlike Bohanza, the game to which I'm surprised there are so few comparisons, there is direct screwage and leader-bashing. Do I plant Flax to damage A. or Papyrus to damage B.? Whose Monument do I steal? 

No, this is no RftG, but there are real choices and more tension than just the draw of a card.

RATING: 8
Very good! I already enjoyed Nile, and this is a clear improvement. Better box, better cards, the monuments are fun... Looks like the game is improved with five or six players, that doesn't mean much to me as to me it's mostly a quick two-player game anyway. But yeah, a good game gets proper treatment.

Update: the game is also very good with four players. It works with five, but gets less interesting.

Suggest.

I received this as part of my swag bag at Who's Yer Con. I didn't have high expectations, but it turned out to be a fun, light card game.

This is a nice filler-weight card game.  You should always just play with the Monument expansion that's included in the game.  It has some fun elements: only 3 ways to 'plant', only 1 of each crop can planted on the table at a time, player with the most cards collected in their smallest collection will win.  Creates just the right amount of tension between the players.  Fun game.

One play so far, didn't use the monuments expansion.  Interesting balance between planting large fields and planting fields quickly, especially since having more cards planted and harvested means those fields are less likely to be harvested.  Looking forward to playing it again.

This is the game I wanted 2p Bohnanza or Coloretto to be. Highly underrated. It's fun, quick and actually has a lot more strategy than we expected. I love the Knizia style scoring and I'd go so far as saying this game does it better than any Knizia game I've played, in part due to the  ability to trade in your stored crops (victory points) to get cards or trigger another flood. This gives you an incentive to continue to build up crops in which you already have more than you need. I love getting towards the end of a game and having to fight to get your last crop type while trying to keep your opponent from getting hers.

Due to BleuVII and "approved" by designer:

One simple change made this game a lot more strategic: The rule already exists that you can discard two cards from the harvest or from your hand to replace the flood card with the next card off the top of the deck. We also added the option of playing a flood card from your hand. It costs you 3 cards to do this (2 discards, one flood), so it's still a rare action, but it adds just enough strategy to make this a staple over-dinner game in our household.

A nice step up from the original Nile. While it still feels mostly like a variant of the Ticket to Ride card game (which itself draws a bit from earlier games), the expanded version adds the nice monument bit and improves the quality of the cards. That bumped the game up a bit in my view and I can see us breaking it out more often. Plays quite quickly and by wiping out the memory element of the TTR card game which annoyed some of our friends (you instead have E&T-style scoring to encourage even growth), this makes Nile more approachable.

Once you get the rules right it's a balanced game that is pretty entertaining.  There is a touch of mystery that is odd with the hidden scoring. I feel this goes against the 'highest lowest' scoring condition.  I suppose that is what makes it a family game as opposed to something more gamery.  Perhaps I will be able to deduce other player's holdings in future plays.

The option to make an offering and flood again is interesting.  I have not found it to be entirely beneficial yet as it's very random and may benefit your opponent more.  I think the timing of it must be when you control multiple crop types.  Dumping two and taking one seems to help somewhat since you can scan your score cards and make a determination on what to dump.

There are rules not in the rulebook that I found only in questions to the designer in the forums.  I think these should be clarified in any future printings.

Namely:

The planting actions are "or" actions, not all at the same time.

Speculation cards to be removed (because you removed some for lower player counts) are any that have any crop type associated with those removed.

Luck of the draw is very much present in determining which cards you may harvest (for scoring), and one player may get to harvest much more than another. Thus the attractive distinction for this game is the scoring mechanism whereby your LOWEST color is what matters (and it can be difficult to obatain a score in all colors).  It is possible to disrupt other players. 

As a rule, if a base game proves worthy I find no appeal in altering it with expansions, so the [i]Monument[/i] cards remain in the box.

Every player gets 5 cards, after that, the deck of cards is shuffled together with one plague card. A players turn, consists of 5 phases, which are.

    Turn the top card of the deck, and place it open on the flood card. The crop shown, is the crop that is harvested during this turn. If there is a speculation shown, two kind of crops will be harvested.
    If the former player has played a speculation card, this card is handled. For every crop that is shown on the speculation card, the player who has played the speculation card, takes the top three cards of the deck. The speculation cards are discarded after that.
    The player who owns the on the flood card shown crop, will harvest that crop, by taking one card of his field and place this card onto his personal scoring deck.
    The player may discard 2 cards and take 1 new card or he may discard 2 cards and change the top card on the flood card. He may also discard cards that are in his personal scoring deck.
    The player can sow or speculate. He has to saw 2 kinds of the same crop to start a new field. There can only be one field per kind of crop on the table, and the field has to be bigger then the field that already is placed on the table. Also he can expand his own existing fields. The crop that is shown on top of the flood card can’t be sow. Or he can play 1 or 2 speculation cards.
    Draw two cards.

When the plague card is drawn, this will be immediately handled. The plague card destroy the biggest field on the table. When there are more fields that are the biggest, all of them will be destroyed.

When the deck of cards, runs out of cards, they will be shuffled again, together with the plague cards. Then a new seasons starts. There will be played as many seasons as there are players.

After playing all the seasons, each player counts his harvested crops. The least harvested crop is played most left, the second harvested crop is placed right beside of that, and so on. Scoring starts with the most left pile of crop. The player who has the most in that pile, wins the game. Is there a tie, then the 2nd tile will count and so on, until there is a difference in a pile.

This game is luck driven. The speculation cards, are just pure luck. Also there is a lot of luck in which card is turned on top of the flood card. After playing, I was wondering why I would discard cards that are in my personal scoring deck, but later I realized, that might be interesting to do, as it is the most left field at the end of the game that determines the winner. By discarding cards of the personal scoring deck, you can discard crop cards, that you have very little of. That way, your most left field will have more cards in it at the end of the game.

There is a lot of interaction in this game, as harvesting can be done by a player who isn’t in his turn. Field are disappearing from one to another player. And so on. The luck in this game isn’t that annoying as it sounds. You’ll just have to realize that this is a very light game, that is designed for families. And for that it works very well.

RATING: 7
Silly, just a silly game! I really like the premise of this game…stacking meeples on top of each other to score points. The app and music are great and lend to the ambiance. The final round is hilarious, though some cards are definitely harder to do than others. The point value given to some cards at all three stages is a little perplexing though. Some requirements seem easy to achieve and award 4 points while others seem very difficult yet also award only 4 points. But its still a very fun game!

Well, very fun game but temporary has no idea how to hit 70 points. Played 3 match in a row to rate it a 8. 

You race with your friend to put up a best show that earn you the most points. Tentatively I have no complaint to the game but you'll need a steady table for this game, otherwise you will have trouble balancing your components when you are trying to be ambitious by stacking your components as tall as possible.

Addictive and the apps' music making it so much thematic. The 3rd round's challenge is so fun especially the one that makes you mimic the animal cries when it fall down, or shout it's PAIN when things fall down.

Amusing enough. I've been stacking catan pieces for years, so it's super silly to have a game built around it. The wild imbalances and poorly written rules keep it from being a 'great' dexterity game.

Light and fun, Meeple Circus is a light family game that manages both to entertain players and at the same time present them with moderately challenging tasks that feel like having been taken directly from the most typical downtime activity in board games: stacking components in a creative way.

My only reserve about this game comes from its replayability, as it looks like it doesn’t ensure too much variance over repeated plays but rather seems to exhaust all of its attractiveness after a handful of plays.

RATING: 6
Nice thematic variant on 'stacking all kinds of stuff'. It's the kind of game that is catered for a broad audience, but has more complicated scoring rules than you would expect. I don't know how well non-gamers will experience this, since there's all kind of tactical decisions to take on how to choose and stack the pieces. 

What I found odd was the starting player has more options to choose from than following players and there's no mitigation for this advantage. Being last player feels a bit cheated.

Another concern in the version I played were the uneven sized wooden pieces. Some were a millimeter off in height making certain stacking combinations impossible. In a game like this you'd expect equal pieces to be of equal size.

It's fun enough though, but I like Junk Art better. At least as much fun and easier to explain to non-gamers.

NB. Played at Spiel '17.

A highly thematic manual dexterity game where you are physically stacking various meeples, animeeples, and other wooden shapes.

Your favorite components are meeples, wooden discs, octogonal cylinders and even wooden cubes ?
This game includes many of them (among others) and you still can play it with your family ! (and it is not just about dexterity and fun, hardcore players like the "act optimization" part of it). Hope you'll enjoy ;-)

RATING: 7
Had a blast with this one! Besides being a really neat game of drafting pieces and then arranging them to fulfill a variety of simultaneous goals, we were in tears laughing as well.

The game is played in three rounds. In the first two, you draft pieces and then simultaneously arrange them in a finite amount of time to fulfill the goals.

However, in the final round, you draft pieces, plus a handicap you'll have to play the round with, and then each player puts on a show, still in a finite amount of time, while the others watch. This final round is really great, as you cheer and boo the other players' shows. The handicaps can be pretty hilarious!

Overall, I don't know how much replay value it has, or if the magic is contained to the first play, but I do look forward to playing more.

I got a chance to play this at Gencon2017 and my immediate reaction was WOW! The game drips with theme. The components are top-notch with tons of custom meeples and bright, colorful artwork. The game itself reminds me of a cross between two games that I love Animal Upon Animal and Dimension. There are a lot more rules in Meeple Circus than either of those games, but the game is still pretty easy to play. Each player is drafting meeples and working against a timer (circus music if you get the app) to meet stacking goals from a shared pool. Multiple players can each meet the same goal and get the same points. The player that scored the least in a round can choose a goal to keep (remove? I forget which) and you play three rounds. The last round you draft for a big finale event that has special rules you must adhere to in order to score it. The fact that most of the game everyone is trying to do the same goals keeps the scoring pretty tight and it kind of felt like what I was doing didn't matter that much. Each round, you add pieces to your area, but the goals mostly remain the same and you continue to do very similar things each time through. Unlike Dimension, which feels different every time, the rounds in Meeple Circus kind of feel samey. At the end of the game, I was kind of done with it. It was a good experience. I had fun, but I'm not sure it is something I need to buy. I might be able to get it to the table with new groups, but the replay value with the same group is probably limited.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Unbelievably fun. Really not my usual fare, but I loved it. One gripe: I don't think the challenges add too much to the game. An idea I had was to replace them with extra goal cards, so players can draft unique goals that only they can complete, making each circus a bit different.

I like the idea, but the dexterity component didn't shine. Bits are to small and slippy. Rules could have been better & the thirth round felt as a forced way to make us have fun (stand up and make a bow, say hop everytime you place a meeple on the board, etc. ) I Also think the app is not really relevant.

Zirkus ist ein Romantizismus, der mir sehr gefällt. Voller Sehnsucht habe ich auf die Ankunft eines Zirkusspiels in Euroland gewartet. DRUM ROLL war z.B. einer der seltenen Umsetzungen eines Zirkuskunstücks und klatschte beim Versuch einen Euro-Salto zu fabrizieren krachend ohne Netz auf den Boden. Auch das themenverwandte TRICKERION streifte die große Bühne und vertrocknete in Hirnwindungen. MEEPLE CIRCUS ist kein Eurogame. MEEPLE CIRCUS ist ein Familienspiel mit einem blöden Titel. Doch MEEPLE CIRCUS ist Zirkus in Reinkultur. Mehr noch: seine Idee fusst auf einem wahren Insight. Es basiert nämlich auf der Beobachtung, dass Spieler die Gewohnheit haben permanent an ihrem Holzspielmaterial herumzufummeln und aus Ressourcenklötzchen Türmchen, Ketten, Pyramiden und andere Gebilde bauen, während sich der Erklärbar einen abtanzt. MEEPLE CIRCUS hat aus der Zwangsakrobatik ein Spiel gebaut. So türmen sich unter dem Zirkuszelt und zu ollen Bühnentunes eines versponnen Franzosen Meeples, Holzelefanten, Clowns, Tarzan und weiße Pferde zu einem simplen Geschicklichkeitsspiel aufeinander. MEEPLE CIRCUS ist es gelungen, sich über den Punkt hinaus zu transzendieren, an dem COLT EXPRESS und DICE FORCE im Spielzeug stecken bleiben und die Achterbahnphantasie COASTER PARK an Materie scheitert. MEEPLE CIRCUS ist hanebüchene Aufregung, lächerlicher Zeitdruck, kribbelndes Vergnügen, staunendes Kind, das große Scheitern des Erwachsenen. Es ist lieb, charmant, bunt und lustig. Schade, dass Matagot das Material hier derart billig produziert und in eine Blendwerk- Schachtel gepackt hat. Unabhängig dieser Minuspunkte ist MEEPLE CIRCUS nicht nur eine thematisch perfekte Gestaltwerdung als Brettspiel, sondern trifft tatsächlich den Geist von Zirkus wie wir ihn aus der Zeit des Wanderzirkus kennen. Und sind Brettspielautoren nicht die Schausteller unserer Kindheit? Ist Essen nicht ein einziges, großes Zirkuszelt? Varietétheater, großer süßer Schaum, eine glitzernde Illusion. MEEPLE CIRCUS ist Wasser für die Elefanten. Ich bitte um Applaus, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren! Ihr Zirkusdirektor.

Original! I am not a big fan of dexterity games, but this one works. The theme fits the components and objectives, and, contrary to what I expected, it is an actual game - drafting which meeples you can get and which objectives you go for, rather than simply stacking as many meeples as possible.

Pues eso, un juego de habilidad en el que tratas de combinar una serie de elementos kekos, animalicos, barriles (cilindros), maderitas largas ... para cumplir un patrón. Los kekos tienen diferentes colores que marcan a qué altura (tocando el suelo, sin tocarlo, arriba del todo) tienen que estar. Cuanto más alta hagas la estructura más puntua.

Además hay una serie de objetivos a cumplir, por ejemplo, una madera sujeta por dos kekos etc .. que dan más puntos

Tiene pinta de quemarse rápido y creo que los componentes son pequeños para algo así.

Stacking up the different things is fun, and it makes for an amusing and quirky group activity.  Problem with the game is that it keeps getting in the way of this core activity.  For one, the game involves some creativity in figuring out what you want to construct, but then we couldn't figure out how we were supposed to interpret what were scoring actions according to the rules.  Also, the third act of the game adds the element of having to do goofy things as you play -- like making honking noises, etc. -- where I would have much preferred something where you are adding yet more elements and doing an even more elaborate final stunt.  

The meeples are ordinary meeple-sized and I think would be very difficult for any grown up with beefy hands or any age-related dexterity decline to play, especially given that constructing the performances is timed.

The year 3 cards that have players doing silly things are stupid and ruin an otherwise excellent dexterity game. If they were optional and alternatives were provided that would be awesome. I'm not sure why that isn't the case.

I love games where you need to plan, but stay flexible. I love optimization games, where you need to figure out how to make the most points from X, Y, and Z, without it becoming a game of calculations. And Meeple Circus manages to do both with a dexterity aspect. In a strategy game. New, refreshing, and fun on multiple levels.

9 Stars for a reason: (down to 7 due to overplayed)

I bought this game at Essen 2017 with 6 other Light to heavy Euroish Games. 

Conclusion, we OOOONLY play Maple Circus. It is THAT good. It is like an addiction, we play it again and again and again, there are always different challenges and it is so much fun. The Drafting mechanism is pretty strategic even. 

I think this is a game you must own. It screams expansion though. I am a bit sad that we don't play the other games but I enjoy this a lot and so does my gaming group

Animal upon Animal for ants. You have to stack tiny meeples on top of other wooden items in order to score points. Cards come out that tell you which patterns score. You have a time limit each round.

Quite disappointing. I was expecting to stack heaping piles of circus equipment, but the pieces are small and few, so it require a lot more precision and a steadier table than I can be bothered with. The pieces also don't have very many 'angles' to them so there's not.much variety. E.g. the seal can only have a barrel, due to both the shape of it and the card, and (at least on the copy I played), getting that barrel on the seal and having it stay there is really unenjoyable.

I'd prefer to just play Animals upon Animals instead.

The draft mechanic unfairly punishes whoever happens to go last. The stacking mechanic is fun, but often times the highest scoring circuses are boring and flat. I felt guilty winning a game with my boring flat circus, when two of my opponents were punished for trying to have fun and stack stuff.

I also didn't feel particularly good about myself pointing out that my opponent loses 4 points because their horse is backwards. Or, losing six points because I stacked everything correctly but forgot to make a Tarzan yell. ...There were a lot of pedantic arguments about "Does this ball count if it's balanced at a slight angle" and "Is this plank at the exact angle it needs to be" which seemed out of place in a dexterity game.

The first 2 rounds are OK, but the last one - the one where the act is a sort of handicap and everybody plays seperately ) kills it for me. 

It reminded me sorf off at Rampage, but this one is more game then only a gimmick.

Easily one of the best games I learned at GenCon. I love Dex games and this soared to the top. stacking meeples and trying to complete patterns in the 2 minute window. You get to play awesome circus music. This is the gamers dex game and will be forever hitting the table. Loved it!

It's a nice idea to have a circus themed dexterity stacking game, but in practice I found the components to be too poor to even try getting into the silly theme. Essentially, you do a few rounds of drafting for components. Then you have a timed session where you try to arrange the components like they appear on the victory condition cards. In later rounds, they also throw in some forced silly acts for the players to preform for each other while they build their stacks. I'm not thrilled with forced sillyness, but I might be able to get into it if the components were better. Most dexterity games paint their pieces with a sort of matte finish, or shape the pieces so they are large enough to get some friction. This game paints the bits with more of a slippery gloss finish. The player boards you start on are thin cardboard that had bowed in the copy I played. The wooden plank piece that looks like something you can balance on was also misshapen and wasn't quite flat. The other planks that came were, I just happened to draft a misshapen piece. I found the whole experience way more frustrating than fun even though I tend to really enjoy dexterity stacking games. The timed aspect seems to take away a lot of the fun tension I usually enjoy.

Die Plättchen sind für meinen Geschmack zu dünn. Außerdem sind die Aufgaben der dritten Vorstellung nicht ausgeglichen und zu sehr von der App abhängig. Alles andere an diesem Spiel ist grandios: von der Idee bis hin zu den tollen Figuren. Kein anderes Spiel ist so witzig!

Nice little game, easy to get. Rules are not perfect but understandable. Tough one change has to be made: The first round first player gets the first pick. Then the last player picks 2 tiles and the first player gets to chose when all others have chosen (inverse the order of getting the tiles the other way).
Then for round 2. Player with lowest score starts picking his tile.

Probably the most disappointing game I've ever played. Its like someone had a great idea, then gave it to the designers of buckaroo. A lack of challenge and cards that tell you to make animal noises are what really let it down. I'll be hesitant to sit down and play any future games published by Matagot after this abysmal offering.

It is a fun little game. It is very easy to teach. We played the last round wrong without the music so the last round took forever. Other than that, the game flows nicely. Just one note about playing with young children. My 7 year old couldn't quite handle the pressure when he was running out of time and got frustrated. I just secretly restarted the music. Things are good then. Overall. it is silly and definitely provides some laughter. If you are looking for light-hearted game to play with kids and family, this is a great one. Another minor complaint was the components. The cards feel flimsy and the tiles are not as thick as I thought. I think they will be okay after many plays because they are not "used" much. The whole game is about stacking meeples, I just wish the cards and tiles can be a bit thicker since it's a $50 CAD game.

Another that I wanted to love SO much and just really didn't. The game just seemed much too restrictive. You only have a couple of pieces and you can really only put those pieces together in a certain way to score points that will be competitive. It also felt like the time allotted was WAY more time than necessary, which bummed me out. I didn't feel rushed or hurried at all, which I think is part of what you're supposed to feel like in this one. I don't get the hype.

Theme and components are good and play time ideal. It's just plain fun. Minus on needing an app to play. Also some balancing issue with the scoring of 3rd act tiles, but it's such a silly game, you don't really care about the points.
Great implementation of a great idea!

The basic idea of this game is decent, but the rules are so poorly written that the game needs to be house-ruled to be any fun.  Also, the pieces aren't all that impressive, and dexterity games generally need really fun pieces.  It's hard to believe how poorly balanced first player advantage is.

[Matagot 2017 edition with Promo] {Circus; dexterity; optimal 4p} Meeple Circus is an attractive looking, fun and cute board game.  My friends and daughters love this!

It is easy to learn this game.  It is easy to set up.  Player interaction is good.
The sad part is the Stage 3 function cards which need English explanation.

The meeples are good looking.  The music from the web site must be used!

Played at Spiel' 17. Enjoyed the game a lot. I love dexterity games, especially stacking games. This is a good one, but not a great one. The theme helps a lot, but for me the meeples and barrels etc. were a bit too small to stack. It looks very good however, and wouldn't mind playing it again.

Very unique game. Much fun and easy to learn.
Playtested it at Spiel Essen.
Didn't enjoyed the first player rule (the first player will always be the first player) because of the big advantages that result from this position.

After posting this, i have been teached, that the first player changes at the end of each show to the player with the fewest points. That is exactly how i would have done it:-) So it was a missinformation at the Spiel.

I had a lot of fun playing this dexterity game, it actually has some game behind it and a lot of fun features.  I am however sadly docking points for 3 misshapen meeples rending them useless in a game about stacking meeples.  It also would have been nice for them to include stickers for some of the other things as well which wouldn't dramatically increase the price.  This compounded with a rulebook poorly translated with typos makes me sad.  Overall a great fun, stressful stacking game that I really enjoyed with some glaring production flaws.

How much fun and tension can a simple dexterity game achieve? Answer: A lot, when it's Meeple Circus we're talking about. The theme really shines, the music and the beautiful wooden components act as great support for this. The cardboard isn't great but it doesn't need to be. It's functional. Meeple Circus creates a new category of games. Or at least it's the first of its "kind" I played. Where Ascending Empires combined 4x and dexterity, let's call it a 4xterity-game, this one combines Eurogame and Dexterity. The Euro isn't strong in this one, but it's there and the public preferences take subtle influence on which components or acrobats you are choosing, thus implying a tactical layer. Really, really hoping this one gets an expansion. Ring of fire, motorcyclists, trapeze artists, lions, bears, apes, parrots, new guest stars such as a magician, Siegfrid and Roy...oh wait ... well, those are just some meeples I could think of. Which of course could be easily sabotaged by a misled feeling of political correctness. Please give us more of this delight! I had a great (short playing) time despite losing pretty badly.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this game were to be nomineed for the Spiel des Jahres award

A great family game with the right group (a group that does not take winning too seriously and just want to have a good time together), that perfectly combines a dexterity element with some drafting thoughtfulness. It is really funny to watch some people stress out during the piling of pieces, while others raise the bar for themselves higher than necessary (and really perform an act that is worth watching). If you only go for the points, and do not add any extra flair, the game is a little bit to easy to be remarkable. But with the right people, be prepared for a lot of laughs and excitement. I need to be in the mood to play this one, but it is a unique addition to my collection. And I am not normally a big fan of dexterity games.

Great in theory but let down by poor quality components. Wooden pieces are unevenly cut, often slanting making any dexterity challenge impossible. I'll write to Matagot & see if replacements can be sent but it's a sour taste to have it unplayable out of the box.

Dexterity balancing game with an assortment of meeple performers & animals, marbles and shapes.  An evolution of junkart with a lower cost point adding a progression of death defying and oftentimes humorously awkward and violating stunts building up to individual thespian performances to the crowd at the end.  Simultaneous play is a big plus even has a height-o-meter!

A dexterity game where knocking over your pieces isn't the end of the world!  There is a real time element but the time frame is very relaxed and there are a lot of ways to score points so you can be quite creative with your pieces if you like making your own circus vignette without feeling too restricted.  My kids absolutely love it and I'm excited we found a quick, engaging dexterity game that they are happy to play with me!

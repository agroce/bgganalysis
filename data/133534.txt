RATING: 8
So far according to the date of writing this review, I have not played a boardgame that makes me feel more like I am in a King's court than this game. Almost everything a person does affects you thus you have to pay attention even when it is not your turn and plan ahead. 
Downside is the experience can be player dependent as it is a game that one can consider 'mean' to fit the theme as you have to actively do bad things to your opponents regularly to get ahead and some people might not like that and it can be boring if no one is willing to do anything to each other. Also the game is not the most intuitive thus learning the game might be harder than the average game. 
All in all, a good experience I enjoyed and wish to return to.

Oh my, there's a lot going on here! Policy cards are a key resource; each has its own power, but they can also be used to gain influence in foreign states, absorb losses in battle and to buy votes.  Getting an edge in card draws is quite strong.  Then there's worker placement, much of it aimed at gaining influence in parliament, with the magnate and in foreign states.  Then there is money, which is both hard to come by and essential to maintaining a military force and keeping hold of historical figures, who give benefits or end game bonuses. Those military forces bring the possibility of snatching figures, v.p.s or money from your opponents, but maintaining them is costly.  A friend likened Sigismundus to Die Macher in the way that so many mechanisms interlock and I can think of no higher praise.  

It is fair to warn that Sigismundus features a great deal of player interaction.  After reading the rules I feared that the game might be too chaotic, with take that cards, laws that penalise various things and dicey combat.  Credit to the designers that none of this gets out of hand; every aggressive act is at the expense of not doing something else that may be more productive.  It is also fair to warn that the full eight turn game is long: with a full complement of five players it is very long indeed. With five players the Sejm phase turns into a lot of faff for the King's favour and the decision on a law by the halfway point because all the offices will be gone.

I find the artwork quite pleasant, although the many shades of brown aren't terrifically functional.  I am by no means as critical as other commenters of the production quality, though the plastic pawns are indeed ugly.  The English rules suffer from some un-idiomatic language and some vagueness.  I'd suggest downloading my Rules Re-write.

I had a feeling that the game was a bunch of various small mechanics not glued together. The production value is very bad (multitude of different icons and complex turn structure and yet there are no proper player aids).

Jul'14 It has many mechanism going on and it's not really smooth. Hopefully with more plays, it will be better. But it 's still quite a good game!

One word - awesome! With simple rules and many possible tactics its, for now, my favourite strategy game. Interaction between players is perfect, aesthetics is nice and average play time about 180 minutes. Best in this game is amount of possibilities to gain victory points, and replayability.

Read rules and this one has me curious.  Looks like a lot of player interaction, mechanics seem smooth, I'm concerned about player count and despite the fact that it says 3 players, I suspect this will be much better with 4 or 5.  Not sure if it's worth importing or not, but definitely one I want to watch

Update: just spent the morning reading the rules and trying to get a good enough feel for it to make a preorder/not_preorder decision.  After several hours, I think there's a good game here but I'm still not sure on too many things.  Will follow this, but I suspect getting it later will be difficult.  :shrug:  too bad, the game looks interesting but my gut is it will need to repeated plays with the same group to shine and I don't have that option.

Oh boy this game is LONG, and not in an epic feeling way… It lasts 9 rounds, but the short version is only 5 rounds – and that still took 5 hours… Okay, granted, we were 5 new players and some are prone to AP, but still, there is no way in hell this game only takes 2 hours if playing 9 rounds with 5 players! So while I will refuse to play it for 9 rounds, I could be persuaded to try 5 rounds. However, even this is not a certainty as the gameplay wasn’t something I was excited about. I guess that the three different tracks are cool and all; they give you various advantages and give you votes for voting on the cards at the end (I hate blind bidding, so this isn’t a plus), and I guess the various phases in each round (9 I believe) feel different – there is a lot to think about and to do each game, and a lot of mechanics are present in this game! Besides the blind bidding, there a hodgepodge of mechanics: worker action selection, area majority, hand management among others, and also the direct player interaction concerning the fact that you can attack each other with units (which, as it turned out, was prone to kingmaking). I’m not convinced that all of the mechanics are as interlocking as the designer would have liked, but I do admit that the game presents you with some relatively tough choices.

There is no doubt that the cards you draw are very unbalanced – some are extremely powerful (like destroying another player’s building) and others are useless. Now, speaking of the card which can destroy a building… Well, that’s something I really, really, really don’t like after what happened in my first game! The fact that you can target a specific player meant that I lost the game. In the first round, right after I had bought a building, it got destroyed and I therefore lost income and a lot of victory points which I would otherwise have got throughout the game. In the last round, I once again was attacked instead of another player (who also wasn’t attacked at the start of the game), and that meant that he ended up winning just because one of my buildings once again got destroyed… I honestly feel like I had deserved to win, and after playing for so many hours it felt like a punch in the face, and maybe it clouds my judgment of the game. Still, a game that lasts so many hours and allows a game to end like that isn’t a good game in my opinion.

Sigismundus Augustus...一隻看盒不知它想做甚麼的桌遊, 原來它是政冶外交爭地盤。一打開版圖看見一隻大鷹又不知它象徵甚麼， 原來它代表波蘭 1520 年 Zygmunt  August 二世。他是在統治時期聯日耳曼抗俄及對外交作出多番合併及制定協議的國王。又看見很多顏色卡又不知是甚麼, 原來它是代表影響外交內政和軍事(整人卡)的卡。又看見不知道是甚麽的不同顏包的圓形token, 原本它是用來代表片個人的影響力'。還有很多很多的東西不知道, 但玩完後甚麼都了解呢! 一隻充滿神秘的桌遊終於揭開面紗。Sigismundus Augustus. 你真是一位難捉摸心思的美人, 令人神往。令我有點兒對你情不自禁。若說die macher 是一位蓉容華貴的女士, Sigismundus Augustus 便是一位神秘的鄉村美麗小姑娘。

Very good hybrid of euro-mechanics with historical flavor. Wallace-style system, when we want to do much more than we could. Lots of backstabbing, betrayals and short-term alliances. Some randomness but most part of the game is risk assessment what I like very much.

A good game that should be a great game.

The biggest let down is the component quality.  Cards are very thin and flimsy and require protection.  Not to keep them looking good - to keep them playable!  The various tokens are all thin card stock and add nothing to the play experience.  The "best" pieces are the plastic client pieces but in high gloss bright plastic they look cheap and out of place considering the theme.  The large wooden pawns I replaced them with were actually cheaper...?

The game uses more symbols than an average language alphabet - and yet nowhere in the game (or the rules) are they all indexed or listed together.  Home made player aids usually fall into the "pimping a game" category.  For this game the owner absolutely MUST produce some player aids or their play group will get nowhere very slowly.

The board is not layed out or designed well.  Much of it is just empty space giving no sense of theme or game play.  A map of Poland with the neighbouring countries would've worked so much better.  There should also be spaces for the three policy decks on the board.

The rules are actually very well written - except for the lack of the symbols being covered which ends up being the crux of understanding the game.

Finally, the game sequence seems a bit off.  Some actions can only be played at a point in the turn when they don't actually make any sense for a player to play them.  At the point in the turn when they would be useful the player can't play them.  This can result in the feeling that the sequence of a turn doesn't flow, but rather lurches from one mechanism to the next with little to relate or join them together.

Despite the above, still a good game.  Better pimped.  Even better again with a few logical house rules.

A perfect theme for me, hope to try at BGG.con. Tried and bought! 

A great strategy game with more than passing similarity to Game of Thrones hierarchy system. Replaced the plastic pawns with meeples.

Gra jest przeciętna. Powinna być dobra, ale jest trochę za długa jak na grę, w której w sumie ciągle robimy to samo i występuje zbyt duże pole do zdobycia dużej przewagi (kula śnieżna). Przeszkadza mi też za dużo interakcji, szczególnie podczas walki, jeden gracz zaatakuje kogoś i go zniszczy i potem dla innych graczy jest ten pokonany łatwym darmowym łupem i z tego można się już nie podnieść.

A heavy game with a lot of different mechanics to simulate politics and intrigue in the medieval Polish court.
Nothing about it is too complicated, there's just a lot going on.
Way too much iconography that is also poorly done.

No desire to revisit.

Competing for influence at the Polish court is an engine game with a distinct 'take that' element. Firstly the game really needs all five players, four is OK, with three there are too many resources in the game and it descends into a straightforward whack fest. There was a strong rich-get-richer element in the game I played, the relative positions of the players didn't change after the first turn, leaders simply drew further ahead. This probably means that losing an Office card or a battle on the first turn, or losing a bonus-providing Person card on your last turn is catastrophic for your chances. Component quality is poor and the English rules could have been better, but this isn't a complicated game once you get going. In summary, more Ameritrash than Euro.

It's the first game I've seen that gives so many different options which can be discovered no sonner then after 2 or 3 plays. All mechanics work very good together giving the players various possibilities. 
The negative interaction between players is a very important factor on the way to victory. Players can use foreign policy, policy cards, army, famous characters of king's surroundings and others to achieve that.
    
It can't be boring, it's just marvellous.

However, I've cut 0.5 point for the quality of components(I hope that the II version will change it). Firstly, clients look like pieces of plastic in straight shape - they don't fit the game and other components which are IMO of high standard.
Secondly, as mentioned previously - player aids. Small, doubled-sided, each of one copy only.

Curioso juego de gestión de recursos con un poco de colocación de trabajadores y subastas, aderezado con el uso de cartas para realizar acciones especiales.

Ambientado en Polonia en el sigo XVI, los jugadores van adquiriendo ducados, potencia militar y votos. Con estos votos intentan conseguir diplomaticos, políticos y demás que les ayudarán a conseguir más recursos y potenciar sus acciones.

Las acciones a realizar van desde atacar a otros jugadores, reclutar ejercitos, influenciar en países vecinos para puntuar basicamente

Además de esto hay una serie de cartas que hacen pirulas si las juegas como tal o que sirven para potenciar acciones.

Es agradable pero quizás dura demasiado para lo que ofrece

RATING: 9
Great game, full of interlocking mechanisms and tough choices.  Limited resources must be distributed among many tasks so the decisions are often dramatic.  It reminds the best Wallace hybrid designs (Princes of the Renaissance, Perikles), but it's even more complicated and it's harder to master all the dependencies here.
Interaction with other players is high (killing their charcters, attacking estates etc.) despite otherwise 'euro feel' (blind auctions, worker placement, territory control).

Initial games should be played as short ones (4 turns instead of 8).  Still, it's 2-2,5h of playing.  Once you get a good grip on the game, you can try the full version (and not got bored and finish in 3,5h).  Full flavour of the game should expose itself in this case.

My only reservation is the ergonomy and the quality of components.  The box and the board are fine, but cards are thin and dark (graphics/layout could be prettier too).   
But the real pain are the player aids.  Structure of the turn on player aid is not complete (and the order of phases is very important).  At least it is provided in 1 copy for each player which cannot be said about the remianing player aids describing icons and characters.  These are small double-sided cards and the same type of information (like characters) is distributed among several of them.  HORRIBLE.  The ergonomy of this solution is really low.  All neccessary information should be gathered on 1 big sheet  provided in 1 copy for each player.

Bardzo dynamiczna gra w nietypowym klimacie. Wcielamy się w jeden z polskich rodów i walczymy o jak największe wpływy w kraju. Dwa znaczące minusy tej gry - niezależność językowa, czyli mało czytelne symbole zamiast tekstu na kartach i dosyć oporna instrukcja. Sama gra mechanicznie bardzo dobra.

Very good political game with worker placement. Very often I dislike the WP mechanic because I hate when something blocks me from performing my plan - here is easily resolved by small money penalty for being second.

Other than that the theme is strong and polish history is always an asset.

Awful rules translation/layout but this is countered quite beautifully by an awesome game. This has everything I want for a game about 16th century politics.
Negotiation, posturing, war (abstracted but there) betrayal and best of all bribery is not only an option but actively encouraged.

For such a slim box and with so few pieces relatively speaking the game that lies within is pure brilliance ...but for the love of all that is holy -> fully annotated rules should be the priority for any reprint.

These Poles have a good knack of mixing theme and mechanisms and this one is no different. It's a good area-control game with no map. Just chuck your cubes onto the thing you want. But, it works great and makes you think, a lot.

Played this twice at Buckeye Games Fest and enjoyed it a lot!  Still leery of the "these aspects will be expanded later" stuff in the rule book, and the story mode is incredibly lame compared to what I expected.  But a really neat game that feels like a first person shooter and delivers a ton of tactical options.  Would love to play this one some more.

I like this game a lot, very unique, tactical miniature game on a board in a nice wwii alt setting, beautiful to look at and pretty brutal and confrontational. The new rules are a joy and the new lookup cards for the equipment, weapons etc. made this from a frustrating game (too much dipping into the rulebook to enjoy) to a streamlined experience. A keeper.

It's a great tactical squad combat game with nazis and the occult. There is a neat Los mechanic for resolving who you can and can't see and the missions seem pretty cool. The rule book is a bear and you should obtain the cards and additional reference material in order to not have to use the main book to reference abilities and accessories during play. I can't get this to the table too often lately because it runs long and mini combat isn't a huge thing in my current game night. For those interested in the trade, the box is damaged but the components and board are fine and like new.

RATING: 3
Played twice. The Americans were defeated both times by weapons that ignore the Pathfinder system. Typical French fantasy, with all the ills and um, more ills of this interesting hobby subdivision. So bad its [-]goo[/-] sad sad sad, and easily the best in this category. Unusually the theme detracts from the game due to its patent absurdity, on the other hand its difficult to criticise such a game further. Perhaps all game modes are de facto deathmatches. Makes you wonder whatever happened to the Nazi party? however someone's medical experiments have been fairly successful. And whatever happened to weapons technology? these guys seem to be fighting each other with anal probes and Italian army sausage machines. And for some reason "bullrushes" makes me think of baby Moses.

RATING: 7
Very very very tactical game. Sometimes you feel even like playing chess. Every mistake will be important. Many different characters and high replayability due to many different potential teams. BUT you have to know the many many different items mostly by heart to analyze the current game situation or you will defenetly loose the game.

RATING: 8
Very cool.  Sure the theme won't work (WWI never ended?  How could Germany maintain that economically?) but I don't care, because this is Ameritrash and I want THEME, not reality.  If I want reality, I'll play a wargame :)

So what's to like about it?  Great plastic!  (Mmmmm...plastic!) Selecting packs (leadership, combat, etc) for your characters creates lots of replay options in the same scenario.  The board is great.  The color coded circles to determine line-of-sight is genius!!!  Adding footprints to spaces with increased movement point requirments...genius!

The only less-than-perfect parts are that it can sometimes be hard to tell what spaces are adjacent (couldn't they have connected the spaces?) and the rulebook (2nd edition) appeared to be a mess and confirms what so many say about FFG.  It has a few too many chits (blaspheme!) because if you choose the weapon pack, a simple template works better than individual pieces -- at least for pieces that are not transferable, and set-up can take a long time.

But these are minor quables, because this game ROCKS!!!!  If you like [thing=73171][/thing], [b]GET THIS GAME!!![/b]

An excellent tactical game.  Board and pieces are beautiful.  Gameplay is pretty simple, and fast, once you figure out the basics (primarily combat).   A fun game, though I suspect it's simply not my kind of game.  Need more plays.  Rating may improve with additional plays.

EDGE Spanish edition. My rating is the result of only one play. I think it would rise after more plays when we catch the tactics and get more used with abilities. Moreover it's a fast game. Could be played in less than an hour. Second play, it's not so complex as it looked. Going up.

I haven't really decided if I like it or not, it's similar to a first person shooter video game in deathmatch mode, and I don't really know why I'd play this instead of Timesplitters, but maybe it'll grow on me.

Trade Info: Excellent condition, only played for one full game and a couple of sessions to learn rules. Also contains an unboxed Yula Korlitz and the second edition rules, which make the game considerably better, but still couldn't sell it to my wife.

The rules aren't clear how you set it up! Yet some parts speak to you like a child when explaining parts!But once you get playing it looks and plays great! Admittedly last night when we played, the team I was in got obliterated pretty quickly! But them's the breaks! I think it plays better as a two player, but does still work well in teams (as long as you do WORK as a team!)
Played it's 'capture the flag' version. It's a lot more 'fair' as you can't loose the one character that can do the 'missions'. Great fun. Plus I absolutely annihilated Adie!

RATING: 6.2
This game plays like a board game version of a first person shooter video game.  It is very fast paced, and you control a team of different characters with varying equipment and abilities.  The game has a pretty good amount of strategy to be employed with the proper time to use each piece of equipment (from smoke grenades to homing bullets).  The board is also pretty unique with a new line of sight determing system based on the color of the spaces.  This cuts down dramatically on calculating LOS as would be done in other games.

While the game is very exciting at first, the lack of variable board setup & the limited amount of characters brings replay value down.  Also, it loses some steam from me being that it is pretty much only a two player game (more can play, but instead of adding more units, the players on a team merely "share" units, so it doesnt affect the game at all).

Disclaimer: I've only played the "deathmatch" style game type, not any of the objective-driven game types, and only played the basic game (no expansions).

I just realized how long this was getting, so I'm going to just summarize here:  This game looks awesome, and the mechanics sound awesome, but it somehow manages to fall flat.  If your d10s are getting jealous because your d6s get all the attention, pick up this game and you'll get to roll all the d10s you want, and you'll get some superb artwork and 10 sweet minis (5 good ol' boys and 5 sinister Nazis) to boot.  However, if you want a deep strategic experience or a intelligent tactics game, your time and money are better spent elsewhere.

Tannhäuser has very high production values, with high-quality, detailed minis and other bits, and a consistent, gritty comic-book style throughout.  Most of the characters have a fun back-story (if you're a nerd and like reading the rule-book) and unique abilities. Fantasy Flight can add a big pile of style points to their already-massive style point total.

The game has a few mechanics I feel are worth mentioning, each of which I would consider interesting in theory, but (perhaps due to execution, perhaps because they're not as good as I think they should be) fall flat.

First, during setup, you have the opportunity to build your characters, at least to an extent, to match your play style.  Each character has some fixed gear, but then is able to choose from a couple of different packages of gear for your remaining items.

This mechanic is actually the one I have the fewest complaints about. I believe the packages are a bit unbalanced, and varied starting gear means a lot more reading item descriptions, but once you've played a few times, this issue disappears.

Second, the game uses a dice pool system for combat, in which the dice you throw are dependent on your character's stats, and the requirement for success is the opponent's relevant stat, and character's stats can change based on conditions in the battle, and whether they have taken damage. Not a huge difference from other dice pools systems, but still an interesting take on the basic mechanic.

Although I don't like too much luck in my games, this mechanic interested me.  However, after a few plays, this system started to irk me, and I think it has to do with some of the items.  The Allied player has a type of weapon on two characters that has a not-insignificant chance of an instant kill. The Axis player has a few abilities that just grant +1 damage on any successful attack.  A character only has 4 HP at best, so +1 damage is rough and +2 is dangerously close to instant-kill territory.  Instant-kill (or similarly high-stakes-on-a-single-roll) effects turn my distaste for excessive luck up to 11, and this game has them aplenty.

Another mechanic worth mentioning, and AFAIK is unique to Tannhäuser, is the Pathfinder system for determining movement and line-of-sight.  Basically, when moving you can move to adjacent spaces on the board.  These spaces are of one or more colors, which determines which "rooms" you are in.  You can generally only fire into the room you are standing in, and can generally only be hit from that room.  It is possible to be standing in more than one room at once.

Unfortunately, perhaps due to the Pathfinder system, though it would probably be an issue with a more unoriginal line-of-sight system as well, the game's turn structure means that combat generally comes down to one or more characters charging into a room, taking out a few opponents (I suspect that the Axis takes out more opponents in this volley than the Allies get to, but that's a guess), and then getting mowed down by the survivors, as you don't get to move again after shooting.  Rinse and repeat.

This game has too much option to memorize the ability of each characters and abilities and the short rules sheet is useless.

Because recognition the abilities is very important for launch the strategy in this game, overall of this very poor that make too much option to recognize.

Set in an alternate timeline in which World War I never ended, this is an excellent blend of science fiction, occult horror and alt. history. A fair amount of lore is included with the rules, which present an intuitive system for playing a tabletop version of a 'first person shooter', complete with a great line of sight system, a solid wounds system that affects dice you can use in various pools, and a bunch of tokens you can use to represent gear, affects on the board, etc. I love that you can not only customize your team but each character by picking different equipment packs for different styles of play, and there are six entire game modes available to try, and a colorful double-sided board (without even taking account a ton of expansions). Slight RPG mechanics here, too, in fact I wish there were an actual RPG of this setting.

Tip 1. At the first game, make each team consists of three characters and use combat pack only. There are lots to learn, so begin as small as possible.
2. Use death match mode as learning game only. It isn't fun as other modes.
3. Use revised rules and item reference cards(by product or bgg user files).

This is deeply underrated hidden gem which is currently my favorite.

Tannhäuser is a well-made and flexible enough skirmish game dripping with theme, which translates into a very solid background, attractive and flavor-rich factions, countless and partially customizable abilities, different scenarios and varying styles of play: it’s a pity it has been discontinued, as it was a great miniature game for those such as myself who love miniatures but aren’t miniature gamers themselves.

Boring and too expensive! One on one minis fighting with none of the usual benefits of minis games - choosing your own armies, outfitting your own troops (beyond some really limited choices) or moving them where you want.

Have only played a few times. All agree on 3 things: 1 - It's a good game with lots of variation and depth. 2 - Set up time is too long and 3 - It's too long for what it is. 

The last two items can probably be whittled down on future plays. I found the game to be very interesting in it's mechanisms and depth yet lacking severly in its theme which I thought would be paramount. The game didn't suffer without the theme though.

If you have ever played counter strike in computer or other games alike, definitely this is the adaptable boardgame for the kinds of game. It has Story mode which is very interesting because we need to accomplish objectives, flag mode, domination mode and a really exciting death match mode (look alike reality soft gun death match). The other new stuff is the pathfinding system that allow us to track enemies in their current circle colors (to show line of sight), unlike other games which usually using hexes. Because of this game only devided into two teams, we don't need so many people to play it but also available up to 10 persons.Overall, with multiple missions, game modes and difficulty levels, we can customize it in our tastes as we like to.

Tannhauser is a decent game. It has some interesting mechanics involving character powers and line of sight. I'm not a huge fan of tactical manuevering games, and as such, while fun, Tannhauser does not make my list of faves. It's very easy to find yourself in stalemate situations for long periods of time, and while exciting at times, the game can drag a bit, which leads to lasting longer than I think it should. Overall a pretty decent game, that is fun every once in a while.

It's not a complete game for me without missions/specific scenarios, so it's like someone giving me the rulebook and saying..."Just play the rules, its fun", not for me it isn't. Given the investment of effort in character and background it shocks me that there is no suspension of disbelief with some well written missions. Is this not the same general team that put out a 100 plus missions for Hybrid? This is one almighty dissappointment for me...on a plus note one of my cats like's sitting in the box.

An excellent squad based tactical minis game. Plenty of replayability out of the box and plenty of variability.  The equipment packs and their effect on the game are excellent, the layout of the maps is excellent...all around a very tense and intelligent game.

The game of horror in the great war...
I love the setting that WWI has never ended and is still raging in the world. I had to get this one.
And I really like it. It feels like an First Person Shooter brought to the table. A few flaws but you can get over that. (It definetly got better with the reworked rules.)
The biggest innovation (besides the super cool setting) is the pathfinding system that clarifies line of sight that not a single situation needs to be discussed. I like that mechanic a lot.
One thing I wish for is that the game would bring more story to life.

Light tactical game with excellent theme.  It is essentially an introductory miniatures game.  I like miniatures games every now and then, but they're not a favorite because I like mission-based tactical games rather than the "kill all of your opponent's units" type of play of most miniatures games.  Tannhauser definitely falls into the second camp, but they do have a few published scenarios that might make things more interesting.  I haven't had a chance to try them yet.

The revised edition rulebook is a must-have.  Streamlines the game and seems to have balanced it out better.

Man, I *so* want to give this game a spin even though all the evidence points strongly to the fact that there are some serious issues (please, could someone go over to Fantasy Flight and tell them to make their rulebooks at least *slightly* more concise and to the point? This is yet another rambling, unfocussed rulebook that gets far too bogged down in simple areas. I'm not advocating for the old Avalon Hill ultra-terse style either, but could we at least *try* to find a midde ground?).

The more I read about what people like and don't like about games here on the Geek, the more I realize that I don't necessarily love board games, I love STORY games. I'm not uber competitive, I enjoy watching a story game unfold. Tannhauser is a really nice fit for my tastes. There's luck, skill and strategy. There are atmospheric elements and top notch components. I'll gladly play it any time anybody suggests it, and that makes it an 8.

Based on 1 play (Deathmatch): This game has a couple really cool systems going on here, but I just can't help but feeling I'd rather see those systems in other, better games. The user-friendly line of sight rules are fantastic, the stats/health system is great, and the way equipment packs work is nothing short of inspired. But the game itself is repetitive and dull. I'm really not a fan of the type of "multiplayer" games like this where you just have two teams controlling a pool of characters and making decisions together. There aren't enough interesting options on each turn (and not enough customization) for each person to really play one character. Perhaps this game would have been better with a modular board rather than two static boards. And while Story mode certainly sounds better than straight Deathmatch, it sounds like if they had gone the scenario route it would have been more interesting. Having both teams' setup lists in the same booklet drew out the setup phase, too. I really like some of the unique systems at work here, but the game just takes too long for something that's overall pretty shallow.

Fun game. Played with my nephews. Look forward to more plays. Edit: yup, played my first full game with 2nd Edition revised rules and it's just as good and fun as I expected. Edit Edit: This is a great game. Pity the revised rules never got a separate entry as it would have received higher ratings compared to the original rules. Lots of flexibility and simple mechanics but deep game play. Having said that, the rules for mental powers, smoke grenades and invisibility needed one final round of playtesting and polish in terms of how they all interact. But it's not a show stopper, as various solutions exist in the BGG forums for the game. The different factions play very differently and the use of Equipment packs is important depending on the type of scenario chosen. But because of this, set up time can be a bit long... say 10-15 mins.

Tannhauser is a fast, furious skirmish game set in a dieselpunk universe that mixes sci-fi, horror, and mythology into one coherent setting.  Players take control of a squad of soldiers fighting for some objective (or just killing each other).

The game has LOTS of tokens.  Perhaps too many.  The pre-painted plastic models are decent quality, but the plastic is pretty soft and prone to bending.  The painting is also sufficient, but can be improved upon by anyone with any experience playing Warhammer-style games.

Gameplay using the original rulebook was a bit of a let-down.  Several weapons were nigh-useless due to the very long minimum ranges, and several had effects that caused instant-death.  Combat was therefore VERY unforgiving, and typically required you to get up-close and personal.  (The revised rulebook fixed many of these problems and improves the game dramatically.)

I would love to play an RPG set in the Tannhauser universe.  The skirmish-style game presented here gives us a taste of the setting, but much of the backstory is wasted on a combat game.

RATING: 7.1
The first thing that can not be overstated about this game: the components are amazing.  Great quality boards and miniatures.  My only recommendation here is that you should be sure to buy the equipment deck when you buy the game.  It contains detailed cards for any equipment you may get in the game (and a few of the expansions).  This will save lots of wear and tear on the book as players won't have to constantly look up what the chits actually do.
This really feels like an RTS in board game form.  The strategies for the various factions (German, US, etc) are extremely different.  The different modes of play (deathmatch, capture the flag, objective, scenario, etc) plus the add-on characters and maps give ample replayability.  The game is ideally for 2 players, but can be played by more (although, I've found this to be not quite as good).  
My favorite feature of the game are the Line-Of-Sight markings on the board.  This makes it extremely easy to figure out (via color coding) where you can and can't attack.
As an additional bonus, the new version includes the updated rules for the main game and numerous expansions.

Squad-based military battles and missions with a sci-fi/occult twist. Lots of complex mechanics and character abilities that take a crib-sheet to remember. Really great theme and immersion. Combat is deadly, kills can be instant!

Tannhauser did the same thing the Call of Cthulhu card game did: they came out with a completely different set of rules a few years after it had been out. While these rules are largely even better than before, they both have a few elements of "why is this mechanic here?" That's because both games had to justify every previous icon and piece of text the original version had, and that doesn't always make for great game design. Still, Tannhauser's revision went a lot smoother than Cthluhu's did (Ancient Ones are nothing if not sticklers for the Old Ways) and to play with the updated rules here is a beauty to behold. This game has a pretty deep buy-in, and while the rules are still simple (with much of the thanks going to their color-coded line of sight system) the strategies between all the combinations of characters are deep indeed.

RATING: 7
I dunno about TANNHAUSER...on the one hand, the setting, atmosphere, and variety of really cool special equipment and magic is awesome and speaks to a tremendous potential this game has as a system that I can see can be elaborated upon by future expansions.  If you like CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN and so forth you'll probably dig this on first sight.  On the other hand the game as currently available is bogged down by a set of rules that seems far more complicated than they ought to be and a fairly shallow style of gameplay that isn't particularly interesting once you get past the themeing and great production design.  I found that I wanted the game to either lean more toward HEROSCAPE and just be a big, dumb shoot 'em up or go more toward SQUAD LEADER and be a more detailed and tactically rich game.  The problem is, it isn't either and it occupies sort of a hazy netherworld between the two.  Yet still, it's a fun game and it makes for a pretty good 10 player deathmatch (!!!) although the amount of time referencing player aids to check item effects can bring the pace of the game to a halt.  I'm looking forward to seeing where the game goes in the future and it's definitely worth a look despite any criticisms I have toward it.

Beautiful looking game, especially the minis. It tells you something when a game has to have its rules totally redone. Yes you have to download, and buy still I think, the revised rules. Even still it doesn't play well. Rules give you a feel of a great game but alas it doesn't turn out that way. Most of your time is spent equipping soldiers that will probably die when they're first attacked. Getting the first shot is crucial most of the time. Games end quickly w/ no feel of tactics or choices. Have only played 1 vs 1 base game w/ skills. Never played catch the flag or the other versions, although I feel they will still result in the same.

Excellent production value, but the map is way too dark. The combat system was simple and intuitive and the pathfinder system is a nice way to handle line of sight. I just found it really boring. A game like this should be dripping with theme and it felt just blah! I hated that the "objectives" were no more than some silly symbols that really felt like they meant nothing. I don't want that I want to see a picture of something like the Ark of the Covenant.

Jan 14, 2008 -- While I like the way movement and line of sight work, I wish TannhÃ¤user had a little more to offer by way of tactical decisions and maneuvers. The game also suffers from incredibly dark boards and (at times) difficult to see movement/LOS circles. With a bit of a re-design of the board, it would be easier to see some of the subtle differences in the circles' colours. Good, but not great. 6/10

This game has excellent quality components but the original rules suffered from what seemed to be a confusion of detail. In an attempt to make the game more than it was the original designers packed too much trivial detail into the game. The new edition of the rules goes a long way to sorting this out, but the game still suffers from being limited to the maps it comes with.

A decent game that does a fair job of achieving the first-person-shooter feel. It's rules-heavy for what you get, though--there's a lot of text for new players to absorb (items and such) before they can get started, and more to become accustomed to before they can really plan strategies. It's a difficult one to play intermittently--if we don't play it frequently, I forget a bunch of the special items and stuff, and the learning curve comes back in an annoying fashion.

Traded away.

I found the game boring and irrational. I have to point to the pathfinder system as the main culprit, but the tedious combat system didn't help matters either. 

Example: You can shoot down a corridor at a target on the other end, with several allies/enemies inbetween, with no chance of hitting anybody but your intended target.

Example: With only a handful of circles in a given area, positioning tactics are limited, which eliminates any chance to incorporate concepts like partial cover or flanking maneuvers (which work perfectly well in other square- or hex-grid miniature games). Basically, your just running from room to room shooting at each other. Forget about looking for cover or a good crossfire opportunity.

Example: A guy with a machine gun is facing an enemy halfway across the room. He can't shoot - there needs to be three circles between him and his enemy when firing a heavy weapon. Why? Good question.

Enjoyed the game, and it plays fast. A little too deadly - it was very rare that someone survived a firefight, so the "wounds" idea hasn't really seen much use.

Finally caved and bought a copy. I've fancied Tannhauser thematically since its original release, but was dissuaded from investing due to the ropey original ruleset and absence of gaming interest. However, I bought a copy of the revised rules and it became obvious that the reworked game was a much more interesting proposition.

Push came to shove when I saw what I can only assume to have been a mispriced version of the revised edition for sale via Book Depository UK for £34. I pounced. The entry has subsequently been revised to £43, so someone in data entry got careless, is all I can assume :)

UPDATE: Thematically delectable, beautifully designed and delivered, tactically satisfying, infinitely tweakable due to character packs, bonus tokens, and team/faction combinations, Tannhauser in its revised format is a joy to play and own. Greater than the sum of its parts. It is a bit of a money pit, however, and additional maps will be required in order to allow it fulfil its full potential. However, this is a hobby, right, so: so what! I hope FFG continue to support and expand the game with more of the thoughtful, high quality products that they've published to date.

It's too soon for me to rate it because I only played Deathmatch, and I think this doesn't work as well as some of the other modes.  The luck of the dice seemed way too powerful and tactics less so.  The rules aren't clear about whether you can heal in deathmatch mode when there are no VPs.  Need to research this.  I look forward to trying in story or capture the flag mode which I think might mitigate some of the dice issue.

The squad tactics game gives me everything I need in a strategy game: team customization, dicey excitement, ability to steal cool items from downed enemies, incredibly unique heroes- all in a really fun setting that's a cross between Indiana Jones, Hellboy, Van Helsing and a badass Samurai anime.  I can't recommend this enough-

Pretty typical Fantasy Flight fare; great components, art, and backstory, but nothing too thrilling or innovative on the gameplay front. I would play it again, though. I do like the option to choose different equipment loadouts, the line of sight rules are simple, and the board is double-sided, which I'm a big fan of. It plays with two teams of up to five players. Love the miniatures. You just can't go wrong with Nazi Zombies!!!

Miniatures game themed on some sort of alternate world war I universe.  Players lead their team of "hup hup" Union forces against the creepy mutated Central Powers.  Movement and combat is basic stuff, although the myriad of equipment pack options gets a bit much to remember (icons anyone?).  The pathfinding system is quite neat, but nothing earth shattering.  Four different ways to play (all of which quickly become Deathmatch anyway!).  Confusing rulebook that screams for a decent player aid to put it all together.  Frankly, I'd rather play Cowboys: Way of the Gun - the two games are not that different.

RATING: 7
This game wasn't a whole lot of fun for me.  The movement and line-of-sight mechanics are innovative, but that was not enough to make it a great game for me.  While the theme and backstory are really interesting, it didn't feel like either of them carried over into actual gameplay very much.  I wanted better scenarios, not just a race to locate tokens.

EDIT AS OF 7/5/2010: A new rulebook was released by FFG. Because of this, I bought the game again.  Whether or not this was a mistake remains to be seen.

The path system is actually quite brilliant, despite it creating a pretty tripped out board. This was a game that seemed snake bitten though. Starting off there was some rough edges and FFG did well taking over the game to give it some final polish, but at that point the game was already on its way down. For all the Holiday Sales that the game has been in though, I'm happy to have snagged the entire line because for those deep discounted prices the game really is a nice dice chucker that plays really quick and has tons of character and a vibrant setting (and game board).

Interesting, engaging theme and back story. Interesting LOS mechanism. Customizable characters and teams are neat. A lot of setup time, that isn't rewarded by the game experience itself. Rules fail to address many questions. They came out with a Revised rule set, but why should I pay them more money just to get a set of rules that should have worked in the first place. No thanks.

Nice componente, plastic models, which are prepainted (althou poorly), but game rules are sooooo poooor, game balance is non-existant (germans overpowered compared to allies), etc. All the usual stuff for most Fantasy Flight Games. Maybe expensions add a bit of... something... to the game, but since main game is so poor, I doubt we will be spending any cash on expansions for this game. Gave it a 5, because "Avarage game, slightly boring, take it or leave it." explains the game the best ;).

Played a six player team deathmatch game with an english copy.  It definitely is a game that ought to be played with two players, however playing was six was doable and worked much better than many other multi-player miniature wargames, at least in terms of ease of play and downtime.  The game took about three hours to play with rules explanation and I think the length was mostly from deliberation between the two teams of players.  I imagine if it was just a two player game then it would play far more quickly.  While there were numerous items with various powers the player aid for each side did it's job and by mid game you pretty much knew what the function of everything on your side was.

Overall I enjoyed my experience.  The system is very clean with the color coded pathfinder system, which is both good and bad.  You had clear mechanics which told you where you could fire, which was helpful.  However the versimilitude was just never there for me.  Part of the fun of a miniatures game is to be sucked into the enviroment, and finicky details help achieve that effect.  With this game you have a clear cut system which ultimately pulls me up to the abstracted mechanical level of the game.  Still, with a variety of people and tastes coming to gamenights that abstraction can help get this pulled out, if only the multiplayer felt more robust.

Played once.  I like the setting, and the pathfinder system is neat, but it's not as intuitive as advertised.  We had a few questions regarding the cavern map we played which didn't seem answered in the rules.  This set is good for some fun, but really needs to be expanded upon, as there's lots of options here which really only open up once you've got more characters, equipment, maps, etc.  If you like "systems", this is a decent light skirmish one, which will improve with more expansions.

Alternate histories have always been quite fascinating, especially dark, dystopic sceneries, and Tannhäuser takes the players right into such a bleak environment! The WWI has been raging longer than expected, WWII never happened, and msytic forces of evil are looming around the corner. In this game, you will fight exciting battles between the dominating factions which may alter the fate of all mankind. The pre-painted minis are fantastic, and the gameplay is simple, effective and fun. And the fact that each character has special abilities and can be equipped with unique, changeable sets of tools of the trade makes each game slightly different - choose wrong, and you might end up dead. Or the ultimate winner. I like it a lot!

Tannhauser is my most-anticipated game this year, and I am not disappointed! The rules are very well thought out with variable complexity amongst the game modes. Lastly, the components are far and away probably the most attractive production since Hybrid. William Grosselin and FFG really did a proper job with this.

They had a nice idea when they did thuis game, but they failed miserably in performance.

Fairly decent game. The components aren't too bad, it is FFG after all. You can customize your squad, but there isn't much variation. At least if you want a decent build. Some pieces of gear you automatically take. And that's 1 or 2 pieces per character. With 4 slots that doesn't leave much variation. This is definitely made for 2 players. It says 2-10, but really you are better doing 2 player. I have done a 4 player and 5 player game and it is fairly boring death-match. My friend said it best "You just roll dice and shoot shit." And that's pretty much it. It is much more engaging when you have a full squad to command

I have played with the original rules and the new rules. the new rules are vastly improved. still a complex game, but it reduces the need to memorize every little icon and what it does. The game board is frustrating because of color choices in various locations meant to show different paths. again, without the key provided in the revised rules, it becomes difficult to know what is in your line of sight. beautiful artwork, however and with someone else intent on playing, a good amount of fun. I think, ultimately, it is too complex of a game for someone who plays a lot of games, and too simple of a game for someone who wants to play only a handful of games.

An interesting take on the board game version of the standard video game multiplayer conventions, such as death match, capture the flag, domination etc.

The revised version of the rules not only fixes some balance issues but is made much more clear in some departments.

The theme is a great (if not somewhat ripped from the Hellboy-verse) and is still expanding with new characters, maps, scenarios and rules.

A game not for everyone, especially those looking for some "hard strategy". Instead it's good old fasted paced dice-fest stlye of play that's make for not too much of a slog each play.

Beautiful components. Engaging theme. Solid gameplay. Confusing rulebook. I was about ready to ditch this game as my wife and I struggled to work out the rules for quite a while. We made it through though and I'm glad we did. We enjoyed it quite a bit. Has a very tabletop miniature/ computer FPS hybrid feel to it. The pathfinder board system does make line of site questions a lot easier to deal with and keeps gameplay from becoming a "measure-fest". 

The variety of play from mixing packs and figures adds a bit of lifetime to the game but scenarios would greatly enhance the game system.

"I thought the path finding system in Tannhauser was very clever.

For those who haven't played it, each space on the board has a coloured outline (some have multiple colours). Your character can only see characters who are on spaces that have matching outlines. This allows them to simulate things like hiding in shadows without adding complex modifier mechanics. Very elegant, I'm surprised it hasn't been used in other games."

The Art Work is nice, but the board is to dark for easy play.  The rulebook is to hard to follow at times.  Is this a board game or miniature game.  I get the feeling they didn't know which way to go.  It's got a lot of 'miniature' game qualities, but stopped short of implementing them well.  And the rules are a bit fiddly to make a good board game.

I may have it rated a bit to high.  I can see myself playing this in the right mood, but it fell very flat for me.

Once you get past the "every little thing in this game does something different" aspect, you can really throw yourself into the theme and adventure.  New players have a tough time grasping the minutia, so watch out with that.  There's quite a bit of satisfaction when you are getting your ass handed to you and you lobe dynamite or a grenade in the group of guys killing you.  You will floor the other team if you get some good rolls.  Not quite amazing but a fun romp nonetheless.

I am now one of the handful who took a chance and came to the game late, once all the revised rulebook and equipment card hoo haa had been and gone. 
Reading through all the negativity I could see that there was probably a really good game here, that was right up my street. 
Boy was I rewarded for being right!! I'm convinced that, if the full revised edition game had been given its own entry, Tannhauser would still be getting expanded, and easily in the bgg thematic games top 10.

Union side is your commando style team (supposedly with alien tech, but that doesn't really come over?). They do have the invisible assassin available to draft; Hoax, a superbly realised character. One of the best I have ever had the joy to play in any game ever.

The Germans are big bold and flash and dripping with occult boosts, and double hard ass to boot! 

The Russians bring the Tesla coils and Mind control craziness, with a Slavic god tilt. Funky!

The Japanese are your straight up H2H samurai/ ninja team, though they do sport a huge japanese demon, carrying what can only be described as a 5ft spiked lawn roller! 
The Japanese faction, never got fully fleshed out due to FFG shelving this awesome product line. 
Tossers, they have taken all of their previous games' mechanics and bolted Star Wars, bastardised lovecraft, or Warhammer 40,000 onto every one of them, for max profit from max sheep unfortunately.

Another great feature of squad building in Tannhauser, is you can always recruit a merc or even a president's son or demi god to spice up the excitement. Ha Ha. True! 

Fragile units keep games tense. Great theme. Lots of play modes to keep you hooked. An almost video game feel. All played on a variety of cleverly designed map boards, with some of the best artwork around. Loses a part rating point for some fiddliness, but still an unbelievably awesome game. Note: A huge amount of the fiddliness has now been eliminated, thanks to BBG user: Rochambeaux. His amazing work recreating every character, with every possible load out is epic. The files are above and beyond. Cheers Fella.

So, Lay that smoke and roll them D10s!

Also own the revised rulebook, equipment cards, and 1 of every expansion made. Even the 3 novels. Sweet Collection!

Started out slowly but got more enjoyable as the game progressed. The rules aren't difficult to grasp, but there are so many additional factors to remember as a result of the variety of tokens that player aid sheets are ESSENTIAL! My only wish is that set-up included more options/surprises, such as additional entry points and action circles and unknown or changing objectives. And: the game looks great, but what has the world come to when a 2-player game is $50   ?

Amazing aesthetics, but so far pretty light on game tension.  I've only played Deathmatch mode and it looks like this game may lend itself more toward the Story-Mode model.  Combat is too blunt and characters are wiped-out with no effort.  It's just I-shoot-you-you-die and you-shoot-me-I-die.

This might get more interesting when there are story-driven objectives to balance the game, so more to follow.  But for today, pretty average in spite of awesome components.

I picked up the French version yesterday (Feb.17/2007).  Here's a brief synopsis:

First off, gameplay is OK.  Appart from the neat "Pathfinder" idea, there is nothing new here.  FYI, "Pathfinder" is what they have called the color coding they have applied to each circle (space) which eliminates the need to check Line of Sight.

The 10 character pieces are pre-painted and the details are good.  The mounted board comes in four sections *which DO NOT inter-lock), and is double side, limiting you to two maps.  Expansions are alreay underway/planned.  The item and weapon tokens are nice and big, and each character board (with stats, etc.) are mounted.  That's right, mounted, just like the board is.

The combat system is very similar to that of Heroscape, with the addition of counter-attacking, at the cost of 1 victory point.

The glossy paper rulebook is in full color, but I find they go into too much detail on the basic stuff. 

The one thing this game is SCREAMING for is a player aid.  Actually, without a player aid it becomes a pain to play, as you need to refer to each character's "kit" in the rulebook in order to know the advantages each item and weapon provides.

My initial rating of 6 is after a single play in Deathmatch mode.  I don't foresee the other three modes/level of difficulty (Story, Catch The Flag, Domination) affecting my rating positively.

Very boring dice-rolling game. Good dice result is key, strategy is secondary. This game demands more luck than brain.

Grrrr... I've only gotten it to the table once.  I wanted this game so bad when it came out and just could not fit into my life at the time.  Picked up a used copy years later and now just need to get around to playing.  I really, really enjoyed the first play.

Theme is what has sold me on the game since I saw it back originally in 2009.  It comes through in everything from the painted minis to the various equipment load outs for the characters.  The boards are also beautiful, albeit slightly dark. 

The path system.  The combat.  All stellar game mechanics that I enjoyed on my first play.

the movement and line of sight system is great.   But you have to know so many little things on all the weapons it is really tough remembering it all, I can't even imagine playing having a few brews or partying!   They need little markers to put on the guys you move with, cause I have problems remembering who I went with.  I am sure once you play a whole lot and have it down it goes faster and is easier, but that is a whole lot to remember all said and done!

  The board is also to dark for me, you need really bright light to play this one.

Amazing setting, awesome illustrations, clever ideas - but I just can't enjoy flawed battle mechanisms, especially in a battle arena game.

I played it twice with a group of friends, we all ended up pretty frustrated. Took us 1h to come up with better rules.
I'd like to play it again once in a while.

I wrote a review for this game that explains the very low rating. Essentially this game had such promise and great flavor, but it does not translate well at all to game play. The murky board with the unnecessary pathfinding system is a deal-killer, and the gameplay itself is like a deadly Frag with Adventure! dice pools. Very frustrating for $60.

Played story mode 4 times now and had great fun with it. I like the tension of moving the chacters around the board knowing that one wrong move can get them whacked. Liked playing with the objectives and victory points. All the games ended with a cool shoot out for the win either to grab vital victory points or to prevent the opponent from doing so.

Great theme. This game has a few things that I am hesitant about, but so far I really enjoyed playing it. I wonder if it will have much replayability without expansions, having few maps and different characters in a game that plays some what statically is a worry. Having said that both my games were a blast. I look forward to playing again.

I love the artwork on this one! Gameplay is actually quite fun, but a few more scenarios with "real" storys would be great. I think the Pathfinding-System limits the possible configurations of Boards, i.e. you can not make large, open areas, but it is an easy and intuitive way to deal with LineOfSight.

I play it using my solitaire variant (with AI cards Gears of war style, against the Reich).

The game is fun and engaging: it has the video game feel I love in Gears of War:the boardgame, but the character customization and team building options that GoW is lacking.

The additional maps, also, make it more varied.

Tannhauser deserves more than it gets.

Mmm... What can I say, as someone who was very excited about this game, I found myself far from satisfied. The promising visibility/pathfinding system turned on the game, biting it in the rear, creating maps which are too small for comfort, making it a lot less tactical than i'd like. Add to that the fact that most conflicts tended to be a one sided brutal slaughter, leaving the other side so crippled as to usually be unable to complete his mission (in "story mode"), that it was somewhat despairing. A revamp of the rules might address both those issues, and i look forward to one, but I'm still somewhat dismayed by the fact that it seems that this game will require a non-trivial investment to maintain replayability.

RATING: 8
An alternate history game in which WWI has progressed into the middle of the 20th century as zee Germans tap into an occult power source attempting to lure the powers of hell onto their side while a crack allied special forces unit equipped with crazy newfangled tech tries to stop them? 

Uh. Yes. Yes, please. 

The theme alone was enough to sell the game for me (a sort of Indiana Jones meets Inglourious Basterds meets Doom beauty of a marriage), but the game itself is actually pretty darn fun. I've only known the revised ruleset, and it is very clear and functional. Setup may seem daunting at first (what with all the various tokens and character options), but once you start getting a handle on everything the process speeds up considerably. Playing the game is very fluid and kinetic. Characters interact with each other in interesting and exciting ways, and there is a surprising amount of tactics to be found in how to approach any given situation. The board is beautiful, the pieces are good quality, and the miniatures look great. Some have compared this game to playing a video game "shooter" on a board, but I would say it's more of a tactical team positioning game, but with the same energy and style of a shooter. To top it all off the game is capable of playing multiple game modes such as deathmatch, objective mode, and capture the flag (to name a few), so the amount of game to be had out of the box is a great value.

A very fun game. I have almost all of the characters and expansions for it. Unfortunately it does not get played much, as in order to get the most fulfillment from the game, one needs to really be somewhat familiar with all the characters and how they function. I'm glad I have it, but I do wish it was easier to get into.

The box promises 2-10 player action...but can't deliver on anything past 2.  There's 10 FIGURES in the box - but it is no fun to play 1 of them and wait your turn.  That's the worst of cooperative (some other person it telling you how to take your turn) and competitive (super huge downtime).

Gameplay is a simple dice comparison system.  That's good.  Setup requires you to find lots of nearly identical tokens.  That's not good.  Oh, and those tokens correspond to weapons with ever so slightly different stats and effects so you get to consult the accompanying table often.  That's also not good.

For the right audience - a wargamer - this is an OK game.  There's many better in that category, and many that are more flexible in the # of players.  However, pulling this one out on a boardgame night...good luck.

It captures the feel of a first person shooter pretty good tough, although i am not convinced of what they claim is a revolutionary movement system witch at the same time traces line of sight.

RATING: 6
After several plays this one went from "cool!" to "meh". Combat, rather than being fun, became almost annoying with all of the counting involved, detracting from the flow of the game. Tactics seemed rather obvious after a few games, and the luck of the dice seemed to dominate the outcome. A couple of bad rolls could leave one player at a severe disadvantage. Traded it away, and haven't really missed it. It simply couldn't stand up to the 2-player competition in my collection.

I've often heard this referred to as a boardgame version of a 1st person shooter, but I disagree. I'd say it's more of a turn based XCOM strategy game. You can loadout your team any way you'd like, which is cool. There are various modes that are similar to a FPS, like Deathmatch and King Of The Hill, but I think the similarity ends there. It's also a bit imbalanced in favor of the Reich - they have some wicked abilities.

I agree with a fellow player's assessment that there is about 80% of a great game here, but it doesn't quite cut it straight out of the box. One of the irritating things about the rules is that they keep describing all the great things the system is capable of, but many of these features don't mean much unless you have a bunch of expansions. If you did have a number of expansions available to mix and match characters, settings, objectives and items, then yes, this might become a very good game. The components are gorgeous and the artwork superior. There is a back story, but because the objectives are so generic (move here and use x skill), the story mode doesn't really tell a story or take full advantage of the world setting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Every once in a while a game comes along with an innovative mechanic that really shines. For Tannhauser it's pathfinding, a streamlined way of determining distance and LOS. I also really dig the theme (which surprised me). Equal parts paranormal, horror, WW1 and Lovecraft, this game is pure pulp. 

I have one major issue with Tannhauser: it badly needs player aids. After half a dozen plays I'm still referring to the rule book for clarifications. I have to pass the book around for people to set up their characters and then during certain combat we have to go back to the book again.

I'm actually changing my mind a bit on this one. After a pretty dull/slow multiplayer death match, I was pretty much ready to give up on Tannhauser despite wanting it to work. After organizing the tokens in some GMT trays and making use of UniversalHead's references, I'm finding the rules fairly easy and the gameplay decently interesting for a light skirmish game. While I gather that the boards now are a little lighter/brighter than the first run, the colors are still tough, especially if you have a visual impairment like I do. (I'm tempted to get the Novgorod expansion for the "better" castle side.)

Update: FFG's acquisition of Tannhauser, lock, stock, and barrel bode well for a rebirth of this game. It's never going to be a world-beater--it's really too much overhead for a light game, not enough depth for a serious game--but FFG deserves props for making a serious go at this game. Avidly awaiting the 2nd edition rules PDF.

The theme seems relatively original. The mechanics are well-thought to simulate snipe-around-the-corner combat. However, this game [b]lacks tremendously in the amount of game versatility and replayability[/b]. By default, the 'Germans' are far superior to the 'Union'. In the house map, limited effect of smoke grenades and ranged weapons make the game seem broken. This doesn't even include the ridiculous abilities and strengths of the Germans.

What made me rate this game especially low is that the strategy is the same every time you play. Union throws smoke and snipes with 1 person, Germans lure out with Hermann and kill with superior combat strengths.

I want to like this game, but the [b]strategy between packs seem very minimally different[/b]. In addition, most character's mental packs are significantly weaker. And don't get me started on generic dude 1 and 2 (alpha and delta). Go Go Go is a joke.

Don't get me wrong, I want to like this game... But the execution falls short by a mile.

RATING: 4
Beautifully produced but overly complicated game. While customization of characters was a great idea, the equipment chits had absolutely no information on them, and the constant referrals to the rulebook was a nightmare. Imagine managing 5 characters, each with 4 unique items that provided different bonuses and had special rules.

This game just did not flow well at all. And the combat system was so bulky (too many modifiers) that it did not lend itself well to a squad based game. 

Pathfinding is an interesting but flawed system. The map was hard to read because you couldn't tell whether some circles are adjacent to each other or not. There were no clear definitions that this circle was touching another circle. And so the game fell really flat for me.

The game itself is fun, and the line of sight system on the boards is brilliant. Unfortunately it takes about 10x as long to set up each match as it does to play. Because of the horrible setup to play ratio, combined with the obscene price point even as far as miniatures go, I cannot recommend this to anyone other than an errant millionaire who has too much money and time on their hands and is looking for a way to have less of both.

A very interesting take on line of sight. It makes the whole question of "can I see my target" a simple yes or no. That in turn makes the whole miniatures game work much easier.

I don't like battle games traditionally. But you slather on enough theme, motivation for the characters, sheets with variable character information, and some of the best art around, and I'm on board. This makes table top games easy to understand with no-doubt line of sight rules and so much character it makes me wish they made a comic series like this... oh wait, they did: G.I. Joe.

*Awesome* setting, goregous components. It's a pity that the gameplay is way less thematic than it should be, it seems also too random and unbalanced to be a good tactical skirmish game (though we haven't given it a proper testing yet). But it may really shine if one treats it as a huge toybox and uses its setting as a backdrop for creating one's own scenarios.

[b]**Biggest Disappointment in Gaming - 2007**[/b]

1st person shooter in a board game. Set up for this game is excruciating, and the mechanics(especially the combat system) are just plain counter intuitive. The game seems simple, but quickly bogs down with a myriad of problems.  I hate to say it, but there is too much player power variance in this one. Don't even get me started on the board. They LOS system seemed to be great though, I just wish they would use it with a game that would make me get more excited about it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros: Very streamlined gameplay that makes sense.  Easy-to-pick-up rules that can be explained  under 5 minutes.  Very efficient combat system with a D10 die to roll against the attribute, with a success rate depending on 10 minus the attribute rating. Attributes include Combat, Stamina, Mental and Movement.  A table to track damages and thus decreasing attribute as characters' health deteriorates. Atmospheric to thematic post-WWI mystical vs. technological advances and contests.  Customizable weapons and special abilities for characters.  Diverse factions with different characteristics among troops and heroes.  Multiple objectives and missions.  Solo-friendly.  Almost unlimited scenarios up to players' imaginative power.  Meaningful to formulate strategy based on your characters' strengths and weaknesses and in combinations.  Overwatch mode is tricky to use that requires the players to think hard, especially inside a restricted area.  Mental attacks are available!  Online game is FREE to play!   

Cons: A bit alienated in feeling if you are not into this alternative universe. A robotic cannon humanoid moving around the board?  Deathmatch mode might be boring in the end game. Dozens of specialties might cost much of your brainpower to remember all that.   A headache to control all different characters at the same time. Pathfinding system is easy to use in general but troublesome to determine doors and triangular passage sometimes.  Unlimited weapon range as long as there is LOS.  Dice-and-luck-heavy for combat results to some gamers' taste.  March-fire-retreat tactics is a bit unrealistic to tactical doctrine.  Shock rolls to cancel hits are always four for everyone - no matter if the character is well protected by armor or not.  Weapon inventory is artificially limited to four items only - no relation to character's stamina or strength to carry.  Command points can be used to do many seemingly unrelated things: they can be used to re-roll initiative, placing overwatch, buying extra movement point, increasing character's value, launching counterattack, shaking off wound, and bring in undead reinforcement (the previously dead character become alive again!).

RATING: 8
This game is a ton of fun, just doesn't quite have the weight I was hoping for.  (Both the box and the rules>)  Also, Player skill makes a huge difference in this game, more so than other types of game.  If you don't play against an opponent roughly on your own level, you will either be an unstoppable instrument of death, or a stoppable pile of dead.  This is because doing well relates entirely to making the most out of your unit's special abilities.  Two experienced players will have a blast, newer gamers don't usually have such a good time.

A good game, but maybe not good enough. The rules are such that, unless you play regularly, you have to re-learn it each time, but at the same time, it's kind of long to set up to play it regularly. Either it needs more meat on it or it needs to play and set up quicker. Probably the latter. More here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/221266/ich-bin-ein-boardgamer

A wonderful concept. I really like the idea of the line of sight/movement circles. Unfortunately, the colours of the board are difficult to read at times, and there are ambiguities in the placement of some circles.

Playbalance seems to be an issue; In the 5 games we have played, ze Germans have won it every time, most of them handsomely. Once by dice, but the other two times the union was simply outclassed on the board
My rating reflects the implementation, not the core concepts.

Overall I think some other colours or other scheme would solve those issues (using a striped colour scheme on a black outline, for example), and possibly lines showing 'legal' moves between circles.

Edit: The second edition rules clears up a lot of the issues (for one: the Allied Heavy Weapons was largely irrelevant, due to minimum range of the weapon). Now the Germans have to fight for it, and the Allies has a much better chance of winning, if they keep their wits about them

One play, campaign mode. Really well done, streamlined rules, AWESOME theme, great looking art, yet something about it just doesn't really grab me the way that it should. Some of the rules are a little counter intuitive, and while everything looks great, it would have been worth it to put a little more info on the weapons/power ups directly so one wouldn't need all the home made player aids or to be passing the book around so much. 

I think it's biggest problem is competition, I've played a good lot of mini combat games, so one needs to really bring something totally impressive to the table if it wants to get me going. It's certainly a game that I look forward to playing more, but I'm not running out to buy it either.

RATING: 7
Complex.

The game rules are simple enough. The rulebook is a bit of a slog. 

There are several good ideas as far as layout is concerned. Important concepts appear in read the first time they are presented in the rules. 

Hand holding isnt neccesarry in games. However, in a game with very open ended scenario options a few extra steps would go along way to improve initial out of the box experiences. 

So what do I mean. 

How about starting off with an intro scenario. Include a 1 page intro scenario designed to work you through the basic rules.

Tannhauser has a bad reputation, but I think it is one of the most fun games I own \ ever played.  

It is true, the original rule book left a lot to be desired, and combat was way too confusing and cumbersome.  However, with the release of the revised rules, all that has changed.  While not everything is perfect, it's almost there, and most importantly, the game is a lot of fun!

With so many new characters, equipment, scenarios, and maps to chose from, there are virtually endless possibilities.  I love the theme, and I love customizing my squad.  The miniatures are great (not a huge fan of Edison), the artwork is excellent, and the path \ circle system is brilliant.  

Checking for line-of-sight in most miniature games becomes a hassle, and often slows the game down.  With Tannhauser that is almost never the case.  You can easily tell who can see whom, and when.  

From what I've seen and read, most people will tell you there are better games out there in this category (Earth Reborn being one of them).  Personally, I don't think there are that many games in this category to begin with, and I don't think there is any reason why you can't have both, ER and Tannhauser.

Tannhauser is easier to pick-up and understand (and faster to play), and I also prefer the gear customization in Tannhauser more.  Both games also have different themes, and Tannhauser has a lot more characters to chose from.

Tannhauser is currently on hiatus, but I really do hope they come out with a few more expansions.  The game is almost complete, but as most would agree, the Shogunate faction needs a few more characters.  It would also be nice to get a few more of the cooler characters from Field Ops.

Please give this game a fair chance.  If you like small tactical squad based skirmish games, Tannhauser is one of the best!

Essen 2007 - English version - Lots of potential here, initial rating 6.5 after a first playtest - 7 after second play (when we realized that we played several things wrong) - though not the theme-oozing gamesystem like it may look, a very cleverly constructed "first person shooter" game. Could get an 8 from me, were it not for the overproduced stuff (much too expensive for what it is), the badly organized rule book, the missing information on the tokens (lots of rulebook flipping throughout the game just to figure out which range the intended weapon has), and overall poor physical concepts (no way to mark characters which already have been moved, the always shifting health tokens, the easy to confuse figures). As I thought: quite similar to Heroscape.
The new German rulebook is much better organized.

RATING: 8
Despite all it's weaknesses I really like Tannhäuser. The indisputable pros: pre-painted minis, customisable characters, high quality components, terrific theme if you don't mind the steampunk demon-nazis; I don't, that's for sure. 

The most common complaints:
Overcomplicated combat system- which I'm OK with, and we've adjusted it easily to fit our play style.
Non-modular board- it was weird at first, but strangely enough it didn't get boring, and doesn't feel confined at all.
Lack of real scenarios- not a big deal, we have good imagination.
Incoherent and hard to remember equipment properties, different for every soldier- yeah, I hate that. Player aids can help a bit, but would it have killed to put basic informations on the equipment tokens?

All in all I like it, looking forward for the expansions, and hoping for some improvement from FFG's reworked rules.

Neat theme and exciting play with good bits.  I really wanted to like it, but it's just too flawed.    Half the characters don't survive round one because hits are so deadly.  Want to win? Here's how:  Win initiative, use grenades.  There's some counterintuitive moments for sure-- two rounds of machine gun fire might hurt someone and allow counterattacks, but a whip (sorry, a "strafe") will kill them in one round with no chance to even defend.  Huh? 

Oh, and has been mentioned ad nauseum, the board is too dark.

Great theme, great presentation, great figures, innovative pathfinding system. The game does that first, most important thing: It entertains you.

However, it takes a long time to set up and it's fiddly enough that it feels like a much more difficult game than it really is. The Revised Rules, though an improvement, still have many vague or poorly worded sections. And there is a lot of information to reference, in a lot of places, requiring a lot of table space.

It's also ridiculous that difficulty is calculated as (10 - ability rating rating from card.) Seriously? Why not just print the actual number on the character cards? As in, roll greater than or equal to the value in the correct row of the card. Granted, the calculation is trivial, but why introduce unnecessary math, however simple, in the middle of a gameplay action? 

I like to imagine the following conversation taking place at FFG:

Tester Guy: Why not just print the rating on the card, and the player needs to roll greater than or equal to it?
Important Guy: But (10 - Rating) is simple.
TG: Yeah, but it's unnecessary. Just print the number.
IG: But...splutter...AmeriTrashy...splutter...dice!
TG: It's pointless. My way is the same mechanic but simpler.
IG: But...splutter...no.
TG: Why?
IG: You're fired!

I feel like the information could have been presented and organized better and made easier to reference and set up, resulting in a much better game. So it's good, but it could have been amazing.

Just picked this up in a mathtrade for my extra copy of Game of Thrones... talk about bling! The minis are some of the most beautifully sculpted and painted bits I've ever seen in any game. I don't quite get the complaints about the dark game board... looks ok to me. And rules are far more clearly written and organized than I was lead to believe by the reviews. The complainers have clearly never tried to get through some truly heavy rulebooks (Here I Stand!!!)

Got my first play in tonight against my twelve year old son. As I thought, the game is a bit light for my taste, but also as I thought, he went bananas over it (and proceeded to trounce me thoroughly in a Deathmatch playing the Obscura Corps.) His exact words as we were packing up the box were, "Dad, this is the best game you own. Don't ever trade it. We should ask mom if we can get all the expansions."

edit: after several more plays - it's lost its luster. If I am looking for a FPS experience, I'll stick with Doom.

Original rating 8.  Played again and bumped up to a 9.  With all of the expansions in hand now I rate it a 10.  There is so much content and variety to this game.  

Really wish that FFG would bring this game back, and include additional factions.  At the very least do a limited printing run of the equipment cards that are the Holy Grail of this game.  However this dream will never be likely realized.

PS - This game is terrible for those who are color blind, so thought there might be some wanting to know that bit.

Own - All character packs and expansions.  Only missing the equipment cards and the snow alternate art cards from the French magazine.

A great miniature boardgame with some really innovative mechanics.  Sort of like Castle Wolfenstine meets Hellboy meets Indiana Jones.  In an alternate reality, the Nazis have developed occult powers, and a special group of allies are trying to fight them.

I love this game!

The occult theme fits very well and the setting feels rich and vibrant.  All this game needs is an 'Indiana Jones' character expansion!

The only fault with this game was the fiddleness of remembering what all the powers / weapons did, represented by the various tokens.  The tokens are a great mechanic, but only if you can remember what they do!  If you didn't commit their functions to memory, there could be much flipping of rulebook pages.  This was quickly eliminated by the Eqipement Card Expansion, a must have, and the decision to include references cards in all future releases.  *claps*

A great miniature / boardgame hybrid if you enjoy the 'wierd war' / occult theme.

Pure Ameritrash style game.  The combat does not feel overly complex in practice, but to read the rulebook you would feel otherwise.  I don;t have any specific complaints about the game, but would warn that if you do not like games dependent on dice rolls, move on.  My wife was excited to try this game, but lost most of that job as she failed roll after roll.  If that is not something you enjoy or handle well, move on.

There are so many things that are right about this game - theme (extremely cool), lots of dice (love dice), nifty bits, nice board, cool and simple movement rules.

However, I am finding I do not enjoy this game as much as I think I should and I am not sure why.  Are there too many special rules to remember?  Are the battle outcomes too arbitrary?  Does the game lack strategy?  Or maybe it is just over my head.

I like the game and will play it anytime, I just don't love it like other games I own.

RATING: 5
A friend bought this while we were at GenCon 07, and my ranking is based on two plays.  In one we had 4 players (as two teams) and the other just two players.  I very much like the ambiance of the game, and the production is first rate.  The rules are easy to pick up, and yes, the line of site mechanic is nifty.  However, the germans are a juggernaut.  In both games they brutalized the americans.  My friend and I discussed possible strategies that the americans could use, but neither of us could really figure one out.  Not only does a german have the highest movement (the chick), but they have the best close combat (the demon), AND Mr. Evil trench coat has mental abilities that allow him to move american units at will or even kill them regardless of line of site.  I think it's a cool game, but it seems purposefully unbalanced.  That's o.k., and it provides a certain gleeful tension.  But until the bazillion expansions come out, I'd put this game in the same category as Dungeon Quest as far as "good guys" winning.

Since getting Tannhauser as a gift almost 2 years ago I have all but given up on this game. I still think about pulling out that great rule book and the updated rule book which I bought and giving it another go. Oh the confusion. To be honest I have played many other games since with similar mechanics so I really should give this another go and maybe find out that I get it. Not holding on to any hope though. I'm also surprised at the lack of walk through or review videos for this title.

RATING: 7
A very interesting action skirmish game, selling itself well with wonderful production values and (in my box at least) the high quality of the pre-painted miniatures. Unfortunately the game is a lot lighter than it makes itself out to be, and relies a little too heavily on its expandable nature for future playability. That's a further drawback since there are so few expansions available at the moment.

Still, as a fast combat game this is a brutal bit of fun, and I can see the figures in particular being used for many other games as well as this one. It has certainly grabbed me enough to want at least some of the upcoming expansions, so it has done it's job more than well enough!

RATING: 6
Dislike the counterattack rule, and the lack of opportunity fire. If you are going to use colours to show different regions, use radically different colours adjacent to each other, not red, orange, tan and brown all interconnecting.

Increased score with release of the vastly improved rulebook. Map problems are unchanged, of course.

Just when you thought WWII themes had been done to death, along comes Tannhauser's alternate reality.

I also think the Pathfinding system is brilliant.

Finally played using original rules after owning game for years. Really like the "wierd war" theme, Path system is unique,and equipment load outs add some variety to the replay-ability. That said this game just didn't grab me. With the various board, figure, and equipment expansions there is a lot of variety to the game but just like Dust & AT-43 this seems to be a light, disposable type of war/board game. Now that I've finally played my copy I'm free to trade it.

I like the occult WW2 setting. I have the idea that it's a clunky game. Love to try it one day though. 2011 saw a revised edition by FFG (new rulebook). Unplayable without the ultra rare equipment expansion.

'It is also not great for solo. Gameplay is also super-fiddly without the equipment cards, which are an expansion that is almost impossible to find. I had it and traded it away after trying both the official and the user-created solo modes. It's too bad because there are some great ideas in there but ultimately not really worth it."

Love the game play and quality of the components. Paint job is excellent. Too many ambiguities in the rulebook and a lacking game aid prevent it from getting a perfect score. Very highly recommended. Dont forget to order 3 colors of glass marker stones. 1 for smoke effects, 1 for Hermetica spells, and 1 to mark which miniature has moved during each turn. The game will look even better! Also dont forget to print the Universalhead game aid and the path finding game aid. Use these three things and it will be impossible for you not to love this game.

Also had the equipment cards expansion.
I'd call it an OK ameritrash game. Had an unfortunate play where the nazi general had the Command Pack. The US managed to kill off all enemy units except the general because of a power which required mental tests to be passed. They failed on and on, and the general was too weak to kill anyone else. So the game dragged on a lot and finally we gave up because all the dice rolling for tests got boring, and it was clear that the US was going to be the winner.
The figurines are painted ok and the game can be fun if kept under an hour, an hour and a half. 
Overall I just thought the game lacked variety, with only 2 maps and 2 factions in the basic game. 
Sold it and got Wiz-War instead.

RATING: 7.5
Tannhauser is a fun game with rich environments and interesting characters. If you plan on purchasing this game, make sure to get the updated rules, as the old version is pretty much the worst thing on the planet. 

One aspect of Tannhauser that is interesting is the ability for players to create their own customized scenarios using nothing but your imagination and the elements of the game. Even with just the starter game, we've written about four different scenarios that utilize the maps two faces. 

It's also worth  mentioning that Tannhauser allows for different modes of game play. In my group, we've really become attached to 'capture the flag' mode. It's fast, fun, and your characters can live or die by the rolling of the dice.

I like it very much. Simple and fast game with very, very intriguing theme and a quite good mix of tactics/strategy (well.. some luck too) on the board, thanks to the good 'pathfinding system' concept. The two factions seem quite well balanced but substantially different in gameplay. Great bits. For me the only little flaw is that it's not properly a game for more than two players as wrote on the box... it's a two players game! A real pity.


EDIT: I bought the Revised Edition Rulebook. Wow... now the game shines more and more. It's quite another game, better than the original and more balanced.

This is a great miniatures strategy game.  In the same vain as Space Hulk or Dreadfleet and the like.

I bought a copy in Ebay as a bargain just to take a look at the system. My copy is a basic game first edition rules so system seemed too dull for me, but after taking a look to the revised rules and expansions game system has become really appealling. Revised rules are a good improvement even with no expansions. 
This is a good entry for newbies to the hobby and I use it for this purposes first with basic rules and getting harder with the revised rules.
Components are good quality. Graphics in the average of this kind of games. Not willing to pay any more for expansions

I really like the theme of the game and the rules design are quite good. Same designer for Hybrid by Rackham, one of my all time favorite 2 player dungoen/lab adventure combat game. But not everyone I introduce to Tannhauser likes it very much but with some expansions and more boards to play on it will give it more re-playability. It would be great if the game had modular boards so you could lay out different maps and it could be done but the individual boards would need to be numbered. In order for the LOS circles to work the boards would need to be matched up so that the colored cirlces would connect.

10-06-2014. Rated after 3 incomplete games, of which one was aborted due to my unforeseen demise (grenades are powerful, more than I expected), another because we ran out of time. Tannhauser is a tactical board game that needs quite a bit of rules reading. Apparently, revised edition fixed the rules, but for us was still difficult to get in. 

Game thematically is about Allies fighting Nazi's in a very occult/semi-historical setting. Theme is interesting.

Setup is difficult. Takes some time/reading to fully comprehend the items/abilities. Guess repeated plays would decrease this until unbothersome conditions.

The game itself uses a very nice line of sight system, that works intuitively I think almost all of the time. Unfortunately, a few spots the spaces do not always make sense considering the art on the board. The damage/ability link is cool! You weaken considerably after taking damage. However, this may create an unfair first player advantage.

The mechanics basically are simple die-rolling, with a couple of stats you have to invert (6 on fighting stat means you hit at 10-6=4), which I found cumbersome.

All in all, I think Tannhauser could be a great game. For me, currently, it's not. I would give it another try, but if my experiences do not improve, it's likely that I will decline to play it in the near future.

I thought this game would be cool.  I was half wrong.  It is full of theme and very pretty.  The game play is lacking though.  Predetermined movement with Arkham like combat really did not inspire me much.  Felt like a re-hash of other games melted together.

RATING: 6
Definitely plays like a watered down collectible miniatures game.  I enjoy the backstory, but it doesn't work into the gameplay very well for casual gamers especially.  All of the equipment info is very difficult to reference and forces players to memorize all of the info in order to be play at all.  Also the "extras" on the board are fairly limited.  If the boards had more options, it would add to the gameplay a bit.  

Overall I wasn't too impressed, and consider this a waste of my money as I'll probably never play it.  I could have gotten something better for my $60.

I do really like the line of sight system they've created, though.  It's not perfect, but I hope it will be adapted and improved upon in other games.

Also, I'd like some more character choices and more interesting game configurations for various group sizes.

I may attempt to redeem the game by altering it myself.

RATING: 7
I waffle back and forth on this.  

Pros:
•I love the Pathfinder system.  It's easy to understand and just as simple to play with.
•The characters are thematically, right up my alley.
•Being able to customize your characters really offers a lot of replayability (even though there really is only one 'good' set up for most characters)
•This scratches the itch for a dicey Ameri-Trashy game.

Cons:
•There isn't a lot of balance in the factions.
•Set-up can take quite a while
•Game play can really come down to gimicky results and there seems to be a bit of rock-paper-scissors in that some character builds cancel out others.
•I don't like the generic objectives.

Depending on what happens in a game, I tend to either love this one or feel like it really fell flat.

I think that if this property gets developed correctly, there is an outstanding game in this box...   
...it remains to be seen if Fantasy Flight can make this into the game it could be.

:thumbsup: Beautiful graphic design, very atmospheric, lovely illustrations.
:thumbsup: Revised rulebook does a great job introducing the background story with small bits of fluff.
:thumbsup: Great miniatures. Decent quality prepaint, but repainting them brings out even more detail.
:thumbsup: The [i]Pathfinder System[/i] is a very elegant way to determine Line of Sight.
:thumbsup: Plenty of variation and replayability even without expansions (different equipment packs, maps, game modes,...)

----

:thumbsdown: Make sure you have the revised rules. They're great. The old ones kinda killed the game before it could get fixed.
:thumbsdown: OOP. Though base games can be found at a good price, most expansions are quite hard to come by.
:thumbsdown: FFG edition does not include enough dice. You best buy two sets of eight D10's in two different colours.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] Yes. Even though they come pre-painted to a decent standard, I thought that my own painting skills would do the beautiful sculpts a little more justice. The comments I received on my repaints prove that I was right.

This game is beautiful, with a quality board and actually rather nice, pre-painted miniatures (although such usually look like crap). The movement system is moderately innovative and plays out nice, and other rules like reinforcement works well and keeps gameplay interesting. The theme is cool, seemingly ripped without shame from Hellboy, and has loads of potential for interesting "roleplay" and story-based campaign play. Sadly, despite all this, Tannhäuser doesn't deliver. The scenarios are rather flat, objective-based missions where you have to use a "skill" (rolling a die) to unlock the targets, and combat is usually a dice-fest where the overpowered nazis win. After play, I've been left with dissatisfaction, whishing they'd included more, worked on the fluff content, written a couple of challenging scenarios, and used all the implicit potential in the game. At least a little, and not just left it implicit. If future expansions present rules for more immersive, storybased roleplay this game might take off. As it is, it'll sit on my shelf, look smashing and collect dust.

I've only played this once and it was a horrible experience! However this was due to the dice rolls (won only one roll in the whole game) rather than the game. Not sure about the pathfinder system, it's different but I'm not sure if it's different and good. Would like to try again.

If you, like myself, like to keep trying new games and play those that you liked from time to time, this isn't a game for you.  This game has so many things to think of, so many different ways to approach and play, that you are not going to enjoy it unless you and your game group are devoted to it.  It is more a game system than a game itself, a metagame if you'd like to call it that way.  Despite that, it could be a great game when you finally learn how to play it at its best.  So, if you doesn't believe that you are going to dedicate to this one game for a while, better move on to other ones.  A final commentary about the components:  nice job, except for the map, because it is too dark to tell one color to another.

Not my type of game, but better than my admittedly low expectations. 
Cool artwork. I really like the easy line-of-sight mechanic. The way you can customize the specific "kit" for each character is great. Some of the weapons are [i]ridiculously[/i] overpowered: "I rolled a 10; unless you do too, you're dead." "What?!"

I have played a few games so far and I have to say that it is quite entertaining and when played with the right people it can provide a strategic challenge no matter what side you choose to play. The miniatures are decently sculpted (No mutated hands, feet or heads...Warzone players, you know what i am talking about!).  The paint jobs are mediocre, look good from a distance. The line of sight rules based on the colored circles is a great concept and should be incorporated into more games of this type (less arguments and spilled beer).  The best advice I have for people playing this game is to use each member of your team in conjunction with each other.  This game does not forgive the player who just runs his miniatures at the opponent.  When played right, the game has the feel of room-to-room, SWAT team-like close quarter fighting.

I love the mechanics, especially the pathfinder one. It effectively eliminates LOS arguments. Tannhauser is an extremely fast paced skirmish game, and as such, most characters will die extremely quickly.

Unfortunately, FFG is terrible at supporting this game, and it simply does not see enough table time for me to rate this game above a 6. Hopefully, if the expansion ever comes out, I'll play it more.

I am quite dismayed with Tannhäuser. Yes, the pathfinding system is a very good idea and the theme is  captivating. I hate the word fiddly, but this one time I'm gonna use it as the term describes Tannhäuser perfectly.

The rules are basically simple, but the items etc. make Tannhäuser cumbersome and at the same time quite dull. There are many small things which don't work too well. The rulebook deserves extra credit for being so badly organized. The board colors are not very well chosen, especially the cave board is pretty bad.

Without some house rules I would never play it, and even with modified rules I'm reluctant to play. Biggest disappointment of 2007.

Skirmish. Great bits, pretty fun.

Entertaining game with massive balance issues. We played with the revised rules, and any German character outmatched every American character (both in play and comparing them theoretically). It looks like this was meant to fix the OP Americans but swung too far the other way. Nice Pathfinder system, though the chosen colors negated the benefits somewhat. The tokens are ridiculous; the health system is really poorly designed (who thought that would be a good way of keeping track?!), and the loadouts should be cards rather than cryptic tokens. Too unbalanced to play again.

Cierto que el sistema Pathfinding es una fula, pero pasa de eso y tienes un videojuego analógico.

RATING: 7
Somehow my original comments for this disappeared. Give it a medium weight only because I think there is more than just a shoot-em-up here that apparently many people aren't seeing. Plus, to really enjoy this, you need to do some RPG thinking for the theme to be more than just something tacked on to a quickie skirmish combat game.
Update: dropped rating from 8 to 7, as for me game has gotten stale; the "RPG thinking" aspect of the game doesn't go that deep, especially when you're fighting over the same two maps.

Game needs a campaign system, and enough miniatures and objective spaces on the board to play the game properly out of the box. There is no way to field three troopers with two heroes as the game only comes with 2 per side. And there aren't enough objective circles on either board to properly play the story mode.
Lack of support from FFG in getting the new products out is also killing this for me.

Components could be done better; half our first game spent constantly looking up all the items on the poorly done record sheets.  Pathfindings can be confusing, and aren't as clever as they sound (make a skirmish game with mostly narrow halls where there's no cover and character's don't block shots, and you won't have LOS problems even without colored circles!).  The interesting backstory isn't supported by the theme-thin game "modes".  Its s bit slower paced than some of its ancestors (Siege of the Citadel, for example) and I'm not sure that it would play well with more than 2.  Having said all that, once we improved the components (adding small stickers to each item with a refernece as to what it did) this game is a lot of fun.  The variety of character abilities, and challenges of positioning make for an exciting game.

House Rules:
* A character may spend their action to go on 'Overwatch', and may then make one Counterattack without spending a VP until their next turn.
* Attack and defend dice are rolled against a straight target number of 6, unless specifically modified by abilities or by weapons that add to combat value. (Ie, a weapon that gives +1 Combat will cause the target to need to roll 7s to soak).
* With the above, hand to hand attacks on an unarmed target have +1 to hit.
* You win an objective game if you complete all your objectives or destroy all of the opposition, regardless of VP.

Hugely under-rated and fast paced Miniature Skirmish Boardgame. Tannhauser is tactical and fun with a great theme, it goes well beyond the Weird War 2 setting with its eldricht fantasy, other-worldly horrors and undead elements.

It's a shame so many people discount this game before giving it a 'thorough' test-drive, because once you do you'll realise how well thought out the (revised edition) rules/mechanics are.

Not only is the combat quick, tactical and often deadly but the universe wherein Tannhauser is based is macabre, gruesome but oh, so much fun!

Damn shame they're charging for the revised rules, because I want to love this game, but feel like I spent enough on it already.

Played a game and a half now.  I strongly recommend you print out the turn sequence and command point reference cards by UniversalHead, and it doesn't hurt to make photocopies of the character's item sheets from the rulebook (or you could print the item reference cards from the Files section for the revised rulebook).

It's a great game.  I never played it under the old rules, but under the current rules, it's a great squad combat game.  There are some similarities to the Star Wars Miniatures game, but I much prefer the combat and line-of-sight system in Tannhauser.  With the theme of rival teams exploring crypts and castles and using strange paranormal artifacts, it feels like an Indiana Jones game, almost.  The miniatures are beautiful, and even the generic trooper models are full of personality.  Well worth the money.

RATING: 7
Rating based on a first time play through.  Definitely enjoyed this squad-level combat game, and found it to be a fun experience once we were comfortable with the rules.

On the downside, the rules are... a little more complex than they need to be.  Not the actual rules, but the presentation.  The book isn't even bad, it is just a little tricky.  The board is also way to dark, and can be difficult to see on.

Those minor quibbles aside, you're looking at a seriously cool game in Tannhauser.  The fluff/story is REALLY cool, with an endless WW1 that has evolved into a somewhat occult spin on the German forces which fans should love and recognize.  Print some player aids and go nuts, this one is fun!

I only played the deathmatch gametype so far. I had an ok time. It was my first time and I was teaching 8 other people. I believe this game will rate higher for me once I play the other gametypes with people who know what they are doing.  

Ok the stock rules for this game are terrible. 

The 2nd edition rules are much much better. Game is actually playable now.

In 1949, this incessant war has been raging for 35 years and finally a secret archaeological dig has delivered to the Obscura Korps a long sought ancient relic. This artifact is thought to guard an ancient parcel of knowledge. The exact emplacement of one of the four dark cardinal corners of reality is on the verge of being revealed.
A portal leading to hell, this un-sanctified zone is found buried within the secular crypt of a fortress situated in the heart of central Europe. The Reich's 13th Occult Division is there now. They are about to call upon the Cohorts of Chaos to help them force the world into eternal servitude.
Parachuted behind enemy lines, a fistful of men and women are all the Union has left to thwart this peculiar menace. The Unions finest trained commandos armed with technology still in its experimental stages, the glory bound 42nd Alter-Marine Special Forces must now face the most terrible danger to face humanity in recorded history.
Tannhäuser goes beyond the standard package of set of characters, proposing a vast array of customization, allowing players to develop a unique tactic and style of play for their hero. 10 charismatic personalties await them to be groomed for battle, using over 70 magnificently illustrated types of tokens that faithfully depict various weapons, medals, ranks, powers and equipment.

Tactical boardgame, world war 1 and 2 fantasy theme.

This game has excellent components and great playability.  The action is fast and lethal and the rule mechanics are quick to grasp.

It's only downside is the relatively shallow mechanic for story and plot.  The theme is splendid but not very closely tied in to the games plot development.  In the end the game is a very good shoot-em-up.

Changed from 8 to a 9 after revised rules set appeared.  Further uprated to 10 after a series of absolutely excellent games with the new expansions.

The shallow story mechanics of the first edition have been vastly improved by the range of scenarios now available.  The mini expansions also provide a great resource for developing your own scenarios and variants.

RATING: 8
This game is not as bad as all the 1st edition comments/reviews make it out to be. 

It's a light  and deadly skirmish game. We only play in story mode with scenarios. The video game modes don't do anything for me.

the publication of the game was quite awful, rules were not clear and then after you have bought the game they make you pay for new revised rules. I do not think that such a policy increases the sales of the game. 
However the game itself is nice and I like the theme and the gameplay with the new rules.
Some new game boards would be nice.

The system seems to have a lot of promise (I like the line-of-sight rules as defined by the colors on the spaces, and the variable powers of the given characters and the variability of the scenarios, game styles, and boards allow for a lot of versatility), but I'm a little bothered by some of the combos that certain characters can have.  We played using the suggested character setups, and the US side seemed to have a tremendous advantage, what with the "add two to all your die rolls, and add one hit on any successful hits," and the "insta-kill on natural 10s."  It turned into a smackdown of the Germans, and I kinda felt bad for my opponent.  I know the game has a lot of expansions, and even a second-edition rulebook that might address some of these issues, but it seemed to be terribly overpowering and possibly even unbalanced.  But we were both new to the game.

I don't even play with the rules as written. I've so heavily modified this game as to remove it for consideration. I just use the minis, pieces, and maps. Borrowed heavily from the firing mechanic used in Black Cross/Blue Sky with differing dice based upon the type of weapon being used.

I'll only play a version of drafted 3-character teams using a strong action-weak action initiative system. One of the only real first-person, team games I know of. And those maps are the best. With my version, this is a relatively smooth and awesome multi-kill team game that easily suits 2-6 players. Multi maps with portal points (I just use my portal points from Starcraft) makes this a very cool game.

I think someone else nailed a good description of the game by referring to it as a tactical miniatures battle in a boardgame.  I like the Noir theme and the LOS linking system on the board.

Lots of ado about not much of anything.  It's got great "color", but I'm not sure that there is a heck of a lot of game there.  Run up, shoot, kill.  Game over.  If you want to play a similar tactical level simple wargame, Tide of Iron or Combat Commander does a much better job at a similar level of complexity.  Neither of those have the "coolness" factor of Tannhauser, but they are better games.

Why am I so slow playing my games - I video each of my plays that is why! So again we have this flawed classic in the pipeline. As you can guess I'm a sucker for horror themed, component heavy games. Looking forward to playing this and seeing if I find it as 'flawed' as many others seem to.

Aware of its mixed reputation, I traded for a 1st edition copy of Tannhauser once I heard a "fixed" ruleset was in the works.  To maximize my chances at a positive first impression, I also obtained the revised rules and equipment cards.

During our first session, my opponent and I watched helplessly as the token-sorting and pack-choosing ate into our playtime.  Still, mostly unfazed, we set forth into the land of the nazi occult and let the bullets fly, trying both deathmatch and king of the hill modes.  By the end, the two of us lay gutted with our innards shooting out radially towards every corner of the board.

While not terrible, Tannhauser's squad-killing exercises can best be described as weak video game substitutes - ones where players are forced to constantly keep tabs on which guy has the grenade, which troopers have the lowest health and stamina, and which leather whip goddess is most likely to reveal her unlisted phone number.

It's just so much easier to jump into a console game with one tenth the set-up time and three times the adrenaline rush.  So while I would play Tannhauser a few more times - and even find a thrill or two - I'm afraid that I could put the same amount of effort into Space Hulk, a random shooter on my old PS2, or a rowdy and energetic thumb-wrestling match for a much bigger payoff.

Earth Reborn is the far better game, so there's no reason to ever play this again.

Plus I dislike the re-edited rulebook thing. Cool that FFG have made the effort, but where they drunk when publishing the game? Did they lack the time to properly check if all's well? 

I started geekdom liking FFG, but now it feels like they are don't care for games, just the prospect of money.

Have a good game? Well put 3/5th in a box, suckers will pay more for the WHOLE game.

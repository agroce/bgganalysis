RATING: 6
Some nice aspects for a tableau building game.  Only average components and small rulebook errors along the way and a few ambiguities weigh down an otherwise fun game. Simple and easy, but not too compelling. Good decision space at times peppered with frustration of the random display (resting is always available and not terribly interesting). Replayability is fairly good given 6 different decks and many town cards. So ok game over all.

Print and Play, prob. drifts up a point when final arrives. 

Nothing special, but a decent filler.  It's not $34 worth of game, more like $25 or even $20ish.  But Hero Realms for $14 is an absolute steal and I'd play that over this one.

It does have a few interesting/fresh game mechanics.  Has a nice theme and wonderful artwork.  Tableau game where you draft cards, that build up your stats (offense/defense) which allow you to attack monsters that come up in the tableau.  It was liked by both people playing and we had just played Clank! before.  Clank!/Hero Realms are better, but if you need variety consider this game at $15-25.  Just don't expect much more than a filler, kid-friendly/gateway type game.

I do wonder how new cities will help gameplay, but this will never go above 7 I'm guessing.  Most likely a 6.5 with all the KS add-ons/city cards.

I like this one!  It feels unique - how you're building up your weapon to defeat the hordes.  I like the choices offered - whether you choose for shorter-term gains (cards with top bonuses; or make it longer-term, planning not to cover the card) or longer-term gains (cards with bottom bonuses).  The crystals are a nice balancing mechanic of income/expenditure.  Overall, it works.

The game could have benefited from a bit more sanding (it's still a little rough around the edges).  (Get it?  Rough?  Sanding?  Hahaha!  I slay me.)  It feels like the setup needs a little modification - to push more items to the top half of the deck and more monsters to the bottom half.  I know the setup *can* result in this, but it's very imperfect.

I think sometimes there can be a snowball effect - where the leader just runs away with the game entirely.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I care.  The game should last 1 hour, tops.  And it is driven random draws - that is, it's not remotely deterministic.  So I feel like sometimes you might be along for the ride and that's how it is.

But I still like it!  It's fun and I feel like the cards are thematic.  And it's a fresh take on the fantasy/deck-building genres so I'm cool with that.  It's not going to be a must-play, but it will be an occasional go-to.  Fun!

RATING: 8
A very pretty game (unless you use the playing 'mat', but you don't have to) with solid mechanics. The kind-of-deckbuilding aspect is fun and allows for some great combos. 
Additionally, the game offers a lot for it's price and should allow for high replayability. 

I just wish there would be more cards with discard-effects (which effectively let you rewind previous actions) making it more strategic. 
My only gripe is that when played with 4, the luck aspect takes over as usual with these games since you have no control over what cards to get next. Still recommended.

After a single play at Essen 2017 I can say that I like this game. It's a fast drafting game. You either take equipment or fight monster (apart from resting). I like the equipment stacking mechanic where the bottom part of the card stays visible while the top gets hidden with new card. Another fun thing is the flavor text on each card that combines into unique phrase when you have both slots for equipment filled. The deck is modular so there is some replayability there and the space for future expansions.
The game is really simple but that’s what I would expect for a filler.

I played four games of this and came to the conclusion that this is not for me. The artwork is nice and mechanically the game works. It just doesn't click for me. I can't really pinpoint the reason. Maybe it just is a bit bland for my tastes. I really love Star Realms and that game is so close to this one but much much better and has way more player interaction.

Components: Quality, linen-finished cards. Good iconography (though the negative attack/defense could be a bit more obvious). Fantastic art. The weapon and enchantment names are fun, but what really impresses me is the flavor text that forms a sentence from the weapon and enchantments; quality work that provides a lot of fun during the game.

Experience: I'm so impressed with this design. It takes everything I love about Thunderstone, but boils it down to the bare essentials. Turns are fast and simple yet fun. That the rest action still removes a card from the adventure track keeps things moving along. I enjoy how the weapons stack, retaining some values but losing others, so that in general I'm growing more powerful but I must be careful about when I upgrade. I also like that any card can be considered an improvement, since I get to keep some benefits of previous cards. Combining four decks to form the adventure path should make for some good replay (though I can already see wanting expansion decks). To draw another parallel to Thunderstone, this game found a way to combine the dungeon with the village; and to combine village cards with monster groups, thus ensuring that certain cards show up together. The locations are fun too, promising to make each game just a little bit different (and tweaking the values of certain cards). Very eager to play again.

Great first play. Easy rules, great art, good options for replay.  Enjoy the fast paced play and changing deck from game to game.  Realistically, can be played in 20-40 min.  The only reason I rate this lower is that there is not much depth and few combo opportunities.

A very fun, nice and elegant game. I like how through the choices they make, all players become different over the course of the game. Some mechanisms which are inspired by Small World are used in an interesting way and the game is streamlined properly. Nice illustrations, a clear graphic design and cool flavour texts add to the experience. Also, due to a variety of decks, only few of which are used in each game, Zaklinacze definitely has legs. I really recommend this one.

VERY enjoyable filler, that plays best with 2-3 (..it is more tactical with two players..) A perfect little game for a geeky couple, especially if your girl likes games like World of Warcraft or similar. Highly recommened. 

Backed the Kickstarter and it was one of the smoothest campaigns ever. (They even delivered early...)

Clever game with excellent art and humor. Somehow this manages to give you plenty of cards and building up of your character, but without the bookkeeping. The variety of mixing the decks is nice, and the variety of locations is also a great touch that can really change the strategy of the game. I am eager for more expansions.

Was very pleasantly surprised by this little Kickstarter gem. It essentially replaces Dragonwood for me (and everyone else I've played it with). Decent amount of replayability, and it plays so snappily that it's hard to find any faults! Variety in gameplay is where it probably suffers a little, but with a game like this, what else can you expect? Very pleased.

Enchanters is a charming filler game, perfect for a quick, fun, and easy play session. There is a lot of variety between mixing the different decks and villages. The stack building focus is simple and unique — a nice break from more traditional hand management and set collection style games. We really enjoyed Enchanters.

Full disclosure - the designer is a good friend of mine.

I like this game a lot. It's solid, plays fast, doesn't require maniacal memorizing and counting (although it helps if you want to play super-competitively... why would you, though?). Includes cool art, has modular decks you can mix and match... loved the prototype, and a fan of the final product as well!

Simple to learn and quick to play, this is a tremendous first game by a small publisher and a great new IP suitable for new gamers and veterans alike. The enchanted item mechanic is intuitive and creative and gives players a multitude of options on each turn. This is also wide open for expansion with thematic decks and locations and has the potential for staying power.

The more I play Enchanters, the more I enjoy it.  The game has a very interesting system mixing card drafting with defeating monsters.  It's a very straightforward game that is as complicated as Star Realms or Hero Healms, only with more impactful decisions.

I've read complaints about the game "takes too long" but unless you have AP players, it should be straightforward.  The effects, graphical icons, and language used in the game is easy to understand so I fail to see why so much analyzing is involved.

I just wish I could purchase it in Canada

Pick cards to build a character's strength and defence and eventually pick cards to fight monsters to earn victory points. The only tension comes from hoping that the good card you draw at the end of your turn doesn't get picked by someone else before your next turn and that the many take that cards are directed against someone else. If the card pile is halved, Enchanters could pass as an OK filler.

This rating might still change since I didn't get that many games in yet.

A relatively quick simple game with a small footprint, quick setup and tons of variability out of the box.

The main deck is constructed from a couple of smaller decks choosen at the beggining, they have some clear themes and offer different tactics to the players.

The towns are really nice, since the choose town defines what rest actions are available and maybe if there are any additional ways to gain victory points.

Some of the towns can drastically change the way the games plays - for expample one will change the order of your cards whenever you rest, something otherwise impossible, giving some interestering new options and dramatically changing some card values.

A tiny thing I really like is that same monsters still have different flavour text - and the cheesy humor of those texts.

„ Zaklinacze”, czyli pasjans fantasy z przymrużeniem oka.

Plusy:
1. Proste, wręcz banalne zasady.
2. Grafiki.
3. Mechanika budowy oręża.
4. Kilka wariantów gry.
5. Regrywalność.

Minusy:
1. Mało odczuwalny klimat.
2. Momentami monotonna.

„ Zaklinacze” to tytuł, który jest genialny w swojej prostocie. Mechanizm tworzenia ekwipunku jest bardzo sprytnie skonstruowany. Zasady są tak proste (nie prostackie), że zagrać można z laikiem po 1-2 minutach tłumaczenia zasad i zademonstrowaniu ikon. Grafiki cieszą oko, a teksty pojawiające się na kartach bywają zabawne. Rozegrałem około 10 partii w 2 osoby i grało się przyjemnie, zabawnie i bywało emocjonująco, gdy wchodziła negatywna interakcja. Pojawiają się w grze momenty trochę monotonne, ale niemęczące. Jeśli chodzi o klimat to nie można wymagać od tak prostej, ale nie prostackiej karcianki, aby wciągała nas w świat fantasy jak potężnie rozbudowane tytuły. Ma być łato, lekko i przyjemnie. I tak właśnie jest. „Zaklinacze” mają ogromny potencjał do modyfikowania, tworzenia nowych zasad i trybów gry. Sam zabrałem się za wariant solo i mam nadzieję, że po dopracowaniu kilku rzeczy będzie sprawdzać się dobrze, a gdy skończę na pewno go opiszę. „Zaklinacze” to bardzo dobry tytuł, który sprawdzi się w każdych warunkach, czy to impreza, czy też spokojny jesienno-zimowy wieczór. Grę polecam z czystym sumieniem i oceniam na 7/10.

RATING: 7
A very enjoyable game that accurately depicts the churning chaos of a shark attack! I've only played with six and I thought it worked very well with this number. This will become a filler that I turn to in most situations. I hope Robot Martini keep putting out unique games of this quality!

I have to date only ever won a single game of Get Bit! Though i am mostly always willing to play it. On the whole these types of bluffing games don't sit well with me. Mostly because I don't play with groups larger than 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Was fun until you get down to the last few people and then it seems really difficult to get back a win from nowhere as the cards become more likely to succeed so whoever was winning continues to do so, could do with a few rule tweaks, was fun for the first half of the game. I prefer playing Skull and Roses or Liars dice.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an okay game. It's kind of slow and boring really. Perhaps it plays slightly better with more people, although I did play with 4 and it wasn't anything special. The "lego" people are a bit gimmicky and that's about it.

This is a fun game for most ages. I would suggest if your child likes to put things in his/her mouth then wait a year our so since there is small "Lego"size components. Easy to learn deductive game of where you are trying to out "swim" your opponents or you will get bit and loose a piece of your robot. This is great for filling time but is not boring and can play up to 6 players. If you want something short and not complex, get this one....our get bit!

I like the idea, the theme.  But to me, the players seems to be out of control a lot of the times, as a result, it's missing some excitement for the game.

The most fun part is we can guess the player closest to the shark what he/she will play to get them a bit.

Are you looking for a serious game?  If so, then you have made a wrong turn in ending up here.  This is a silly game experience and not much of a game.  It's an experience that if accompanied by playful banter and beer (but mostly beer) can be a nice distraction between real games.  But if this is approached as an actual game... well, that's just chum in the waters.  Mechanically, it's just a double think blind bid.  The redeeming quality is that even as you lose, you get satisfaction in ripping the limbs off your poor robot pawn.  And if that fails, you can play with mini-jaws and dream of devouring your opponents.

This is a veeeery simple game. Plays from 3 to 6, but there's a variant to play with 2. I think it plays better with 4 and up. There's some strategy involved where you need to check what cards are already on the table (played by other players) and what card you think they will play.
The deluxe version has a nice plastic shark and some stickers for the pirate figures for added effect.

My rating may be too harsh because I played it with all-adult players and it looks like this is a game to play with small kids only, wherein it may work but all-adults groups should stay away from this if only for the massive randomness included with no decisions at all, just double-guessing. I would rather play Category 5 which is very chaotic and luck-driven too but at least creates illusion of some decisions involved.

A great fun game that's quick and easy to play, the real shining moments of it are when friends play the cards you didn't expect.  When certain players tie or don't tie, and who is eaten as a result, is always a thrill!

First Impression: A fun game for the family with a fair amount of bluffing and double think. Do you play a powerful card and secure your position at the head of the pack, hoping that nobody had a similar idea? Or do you gamble that others will play high and opt to play low in order to weed out your weaker cards? This game makes a great 15 minute filler.

This game is a HUGE hit with my kids.  The concept is weird enough to be fun for me yet easy enough to understand for my younger kids at 5 and 6.  We played through a complete game and it was a laugh out loud fun.  The kids love pulling limbs of their people.  Of course, they love watching others have to pull off limbs just as much.  I also got the pink player add-on.  I am backing the Walk The Plank game by the same people where I will get the orange player and the expansion called Sharkspansion.  Great game to replace the typical "all ages" games you find at the local WalMart.  Only this one is actually good.

Not to be underestimated as a filler. Ranked way too low on the BG list. Fun, slightly strategic, and quick. Your trying to read other players and play the card most beneficial to you.

I really enjoy this game, really simple bluffing and game theory stuff going on, but the theme really lifts it. Feels like its a bit too easy to play down to the minimum hand size to get your cards back, but apart from that it plays really well.

RATING: 7
Just an amazingly enjoyable simple game.  I have seldom seen a game with so much enjoyment with so little rules.  The theme makes it very entertaining, and the components are great.  Everyone I have played this game with have had a great time.  Lots of laughter and fun is had around this game, and it can be played with non-gamers or gamers.

I bought a Lego shark to go with my copy because it helps solidify the theme and the look of the game.  In the few times I've played it so far, it has always attracted a crowd of onlookers.  Also, I have had several members of our youth group say that they LOVE the game, and one person even said it was his favorite game.  Those are the kind of glowing reviews you can expect from this simple game.

RATING: 3
Ultra simple game of playing one card every turn from 1-7.  It reminds of Worm Up! in that you get to do move unless you played the same number as someone else.  Worm Up! has a more interesting movement mechanic though where you can try to cut people off.  The components in this game are neat, but not enough to make it worthwhile.  Overall, a very unimpressive game to me.

Such a great time in such a little game! Get Bit is what any filler should be: short, fun and mercilessly competitive.

Moreover, not only is this game all of the above but it’s also slightly thematic, which is never unwelcome in my book: it also gets extra points for the great jointed figures included. [i](May 2014)[/i]

Though I would play it again, just so I can pull off the blue guys arm and stick it in the sharks mouth...

The pieces and graphics are really cool, but that's about all this game has going for it.  The card play is fairly random, as it generally doesn't matter what the heck you play, so long as you don't match with someone that is currently ahead of you in line.  I suppose you could do some card counting if you really felt like it to give yourself a better chance at playing a good card, but control is very slight.  Having that been said, the game is slightly entertaining and is a decent way to waste 10 minutes if you truly need to waste 10 minutes.

Really fun game, and I only got 2 rules wrong. I knew the game was super simple to the point I only glanced through the rules and forgot 2 things. Those two things are that, if a a player gets bit they get to pick up all their cards and go to the front of the line. This meant that whoever was at the back had a major disadvantage and would be out incredibly quickly. This didn't stop us from enjoying the game a lot, and I would like to play this with the family and with friends a lot more often. It's the perfect filler game. Fast, loud, and silly.

Fun and cute little filler. There's just enough to think about to keep it interesting, especially when you know your group well enough to play some mind games (particularly when it comes down to the last three players). 

My only complaint is that with a full complement of players, it runs a tad longer than I'd like for a filler. Then again all my games so far have always included new players, so it could very well just be that.

You could pitch this game as a "guess what your opponents are going to play" "get in their heads" kind of game, but that totally falls flat. There are way better games that do this, like BattleCon. This honestly feels pretty weak, and I find that simply picking a random card works as a strategy. But if everyone at the table does this, you're playing glorified War.

RATING: 5
Silly little filler themed on pirates attempting to be the furthest from the shark at the end of a round, or else they "get bit".  Players play a card face down, then reveal together.  Cards are resolved in lowest to highest, moving to the front of the line.  However, if you played the same value as another player, you don't move.  Player at the end of the line "get bit", gets their cards back, and moves to the front.  Players are eliminated when they are reduced to a torso (you pull arms and legs of the figures), and when there are two remaining, the player in front wins.  Silly, but it works fine.

Funny little game that's actually a bit deeper than might appear at first. Lots of double think in this ("I think that he'll play this but since he knows that i think he thinks that, he's prolly...") Fun to play at the end of a longer game to relax the brain :)

Quite an interesting game. When it was first previewed live during ESSEN 2011 by Seth, I wasn't incline to it as I figured the game was too light for me. But, when I tried it tonight, man it was hilarious! It's fun to see players trying to figure out what card to play, trying to be as far as they can from the hungry shark.

There can be some intense moment, especially if you're next on the menu.

With simple and functional game components, it's highly portable and easy to teach. I'm not fond of game that has player elimination, but this one is an exception.

Another game new to me, another instance purchase, and a ton of fun! (didn't hurt that I won either). This is an underrated game that I'm going to keep recommending.

Very simple card game. Ripping limbs off little pirates is fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Think of Get Bit! As the most cerebral, strategic game of Rock, Scissors, Paper you will ever play, delivered in the most morbid but hilarious format.

The ins-and-outs of the game are easy.  Players each play a numerical card in a trick-taking format, each player starting with the same set of cards. Any unique numbered card played moves the players up the queue, however, if two or more players play the same number they stay where they are, effectively putting them at the back of the queue.  Whoever is in last at the end of the trick loses a limb and jumps to the front of the queue.  Repeat until there is only one player with any limbs intact.

Don’t let the seemingly brutal nature of this game fool you as it is actually very sporting; since all players select their cards simultaneously this prevents any single player being picked on.  Players who get bit are moved up to the front of the queue and get their set of cards back, meanwhile everyone else has to wait till they are down to two cards left.

Extra points have to be given to Mayday Games as the shark has a mouth that opens and closes, capable of holding the removed limb!

To be brutal, the bits make the game. I don't suppose I'm surprised, really, but it means that the head stickers that constantly fall off are extra-irksome. As for why I no longer own it, I couldn't quite seem the point. I like light games, but it's just too chaotic for the gimmick to matter after a play or two.

Players: 2-6
Duration: 10-20 mins
Type: Children's, racing

I bought Get Bit! for the components--colorful, Lego-type robots and a shark, and a really cute goal: Swim faster than the other players or get eaten.  As a swimmer gets eaten he loses one of four removable appendages.  

On the robots each appendage is composed of more than one part and in a variant extending the game, it takes more chomps to kill a person.  I find however, that the shorter version makes for the better game--otherwise it is too repetitious and furthermore, dead victims are out of the game.

One problem, the robots' hands fall off easily and are very tiny and can get easily lost.  I think I will glue these hands on since I really don't want to play the longer version.

The publisher recommends ages 8+ (is this because of content?), but a 6 year old can easily play.  This can be fun on rare occasions with adults as a filler game, but I  prefer this as a quick child's game.

Get Bit! 鯊口餘生 2-6(6)
This game is just silly silly fun. And surprisingly it works with my grown-up group as we just love light-heart game once in a while. On the other hand, I have also brought this to the table with 3rd and 4th graders and they understood it very well. The niche fun for them is they get to dissemble and reassemble the robot parts and the kids just love doing mix-and-match all colors over and over. The suspense of the shark biting made a lot of laughs throughout the session. The creativity with the robot gesture from players is something you don't see in other board games.

Nice premise, fun little filler, very children friendly.
But telling that Rebecca who usually complains about games being too complicated, thought that there was next to no tactics/strategy.

Actually plays much better with 3 player, as each person takes 2 sets of decks/robots, and has a different win/lose condition, much more tactical.

Not a complex game, nor is it one I would seek out to play for myself. I obtained it to play with my young siblings, and for that it serves well. It is a good introductory game for young children to introduce them to the concept of decision making in games and thinking tactically.

Gyakorlatilag egy egyszámjáték megfűszerezve némi figurás bolondsággal. Nem egy komoly darab, de amire való azt jól hozza. Bármilyen társaságban elő lehet kapni egy 15 perces játékra, és garantált a hőbörgés, röhögés.
A matricás figurák nagyon jól néznek, de sajnos a matrica nem igazán ragad a fejükre, így az utólagos ragasztózás elengedhetetlen.

This is a realy good filler game, that anyone can play. The rules are so simple. Yet the game is a ton of fun and laughs. Game plays really quick and the components are awesome, for such a little game. The little robots figures come off, when they get bit by the shark and are reattachable, after the game. Every one will be playing with them and posing them in all kinds of funny ways. The cards are really thick and will last forever. They even have a noce finish on them, but may scratch easily.

This is just a quick fun little gamr, that everyone should have or at least play once.

This game plays very well with people of all ages, the mechanical is simple to teach and easy to learn.
Who cares about the shark? You just need to swim faster than other robots. You don't even need to be the fast everytime as long as you keep moving.

Great social bluffing game. Despite the childish look and simple gameplay, Get Bit is a awesome light strategy filler game that can be a lot of fun.

The 2 players variation is a bit lame but since this game is so fast and easy to teach it's likely you won't be playing it at 2 players only much times anyway.

Quick and simple game with a mean streak. Players choose a card and reveal it simultaneously. The turn order is then changed. Any players who played the same card as at least one other person don't move, but players who played a unique card get to move to the front. Mr. Shark then eats a limb from the player closest to him. Once you lose all 4 limbs you're out of the game. The rules are simple, and it's nice trying to guess which card your opponent will play. Being slowly dismembered, and eventually being thrown out of the game, makes for a slightly macabre experience, however.

A funny little card game where you try to outguess the other players. The pieces are hilarious and the game is fun, but it really needs at least 4 people, I think. The 2 (and probably also the 3) player variant just adds too much time and trouble to what should be a fast and funny game.

Super light, quick filler that is mildly entertaining. It is a simpler, quicker, and cleaner version of Niagara and Tikki Topple. You have a bunch of robots trying to swim away from a shark. You have seven cards ranked 1 through 7. Everyone "locks" in a card and reveals simultaneously. If two or more players played a card of the same rank--regardless of how high it is--do not move their robots. Otherwise, starting with the lowest rank and proceeding up in rank, players advance their robot to the front of the line. After the order of the robots is resolved, the robot at the end of the line gets one of his limbs bitten off. When a robot has all of his limbs removed, he is eaten by the shark and is out of the game. The last robot swimming is the winner. It seems grotesque to see your robot chomped into smaller pieces, but it is very entertaining to watch another player's robot get eaten.

The components are very good, with high-quality plastic robots with configurable (and removable) limbs. The cards are moderately thick card stock. Not a bad filler, but it seems overly priced at $25 retail for such a simple game. It's a solid '6'.

The theme--robots being chased by a hungry shark-- should make anyone smile, me included.  The game itself is simultaneous action selection--cards let you move ahead of other players in descending order, but ties let neither player move.  It seems pretty random since I didn't see any way to figure out what other players would play.  It would probably be a great game to play with kids, though.

A clever little kid's game.  It uses the basic Raj/Hol's Der Geier mechanic of blind card placement.  The twist that makes the game stand out is the little plastic "lego style" men.  They are multi-jointed and placed in a circle.  Each round a shark eats a limb from the player in last place.  For the kid with a shark fettish, this will be a sure winner.

This is a funny and entertaining card game. The main bit about Get Bit is the awesome shark and robot toys. They are the coolest parts of the game even if they aren't main part of the game. It's mostly just a very simple (maybe too simple) trick taking card game where the person with the bottom card loses a limb off their robot to the shark. There really isn't much to this game, so you'll spend a lot of time just playing with the toys, but that's fun enough for me. For my wife, well... that's another story. She hates this game! She takes it way too personal when her robot gets eaten first (which it usually does). This game isn't for everyone and is definitely just meant to be a light filler game, but I like it a lot.

Ok family game or filler game. Probably better to play where your used cards are face down as it adds some guess work as to which cards were played. Having the cards face up makes it pretty easy to decide what card to play to keep someone from getting past your guy.

Get Bit! is a decent filler game. The components and simple rules make it easy to get to the table while the psychology of predicting what cards players will play can be addictive, frustrating, and fun all at the same time.

But I'm not a fan of the player elimination aspect (especially when bad luck knocks one out quickly) and the win condition (it feels anti-climatic that the robot in first rather than the last robot swimming would win).

I'll play it occasionally, but this filler game hasn't had legs (pun intended).

This comment is for the Deluxe Tin Edition from Mayday Games.

2014-04-24

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2012)

Played with 4 players only. Good party game for a few laughs. It is very easy to explain and it plays quickly, It is also fun trying to outguess your opponents. Still I found the game to be mostly luck when more than two players have most of their cards in their hands (unless the game explainer got some rules wrong but that seems very unlikely) . 

Not sure why some friends claim the game has strategy. I will play it again soon to see if I’m wrong. From my point of view, the game is very shallow with very little strategy and obvious decisions. Lots of uncontrollable luck.

The game components are great, the idea of physically remove a limb when eaten is also very cool.

A game to play from time to time. I don’t think I’ll buy it.

Get Bit! is based on the premise that you do not need to out run the bear, you just need to out run the guy next to you. In this case, though, it is a shark and you need to out swim the other swimmers. Players are given a figure with detachable arms and legs, which are lined up randomly in front of a shark. Every player has a hand of cards from 1-7. Each turn players pick a card from their hand and reveal simultaneously. Low numbers move first to the front of the line and on down, but if two or more players reveal the same number they do not move. The player in the back at the end of the turn loses a limb, moves to the front, and picks up all of their cards. If you are fortunate enough to play five cards without getting bit, you can also pick your cards up. The winner is the swimmer in front when only two simmers are left. There is player elimination, but the game is quick and it's not a problem. It's an easy game to break out to get in a quick play, especially if kids are involved, but it feels like you have very limited control over anything that happens. You have some, but I'm not sure you have enough to actually win the game with superior play...

As a light, fun party style game, Get Bit! is one of my favorites. It plays quickly, supports a good amount of players (more with expansions) and leads to hilarity. It is also the smallest game I own (about 3"x3" in the tin version) making it extremely portable. The deluxe version which comes with stickers for the miniatures is nice, but the face stickers do not stick well enough to wrap around the heads of the figures, causing this to lose some points for component quality.

Like many bluffing games this depends on the people you play with. Under the right circumstances this game is a great time. But it is, in the end, only a good game. It's light, it's fun, and a socially enjoyable experience. It's nothing more than that.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Get Bit![/b][/size]
- There are other light filler games that similarly lack meaningful decisions that I would rather play.
- The game revolves around player elimination and supports more than 2 players which is bad game design. 
- The game has the "guess a card" mechanic, which I dislike. 
- The game plays itself

Definitely a filler or kids game. (Found out we played it wrong. so will try again)

Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark.

The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!

As long as you don't mind the theme (sharks eating people/robots), this is a fun little card game that is all about the shell game.  

LIKES:

* Fun, quick, and mean spirited.
* All about the shell game - figuring out what other people are playing and playing your card accordingly.
* There's some strategy to consider as players cannot re-use the cards they played unless they drop down to only two cards left, get eaten, or play the same card as someone else.

DISLIKES:

* I can't believe the game comes with just a card for the shark.  That's stupid.  The lego shark makes the game much more, um, thematic and enjoyable!

I always knew at some point I would purchase and like Get Bit! From the first time I saw the robots, to reading the rules I knew it was right up my alley. Sure enough I finally picked up a copy of this fun little game and gave it a whirl. The game play is extremely simple and straightforward with players choosing one card out of their hand in playing it. If someone else played that same card you don't get to move. if no one did then you get to move to the front of the line. The person in back of the line gets bit and loses an arm. A nice little filler that may just go a bit long in for what it is, but is none the less lots of fun while playing. And come one, who doesn't love those little miniature robots, and the shark?

Heh. Who doesn't like to see their friends getting bit by a shark limb by limb? It's a fun and psychological game whereby you need to be the only one with the chosen number. If your number is unique, you get to swim faster, the bigger the number the better. But if your number isn't unique you get left behind! I actually love the fact that the figures can be torn limb from limb and it's always good to try to gang up on someone.

Have played once. A little skeptical about longer term replayability but the conceit and design is cute. Seems a touch too random - my wee robot - Willard - just ended up at the back for the whole game due to other people picking the same number as me, and he was basically eaten completely without anyone else being touched. Will probably try again with more people (I played with three).

Very light and simple game that has been a hit with the people I've played with.  Fun seeing the frustration when people match numbers so they don't move and get bit over and over again.  Constantly pulling off limbs is wearing down the plastic on the little robot figures though.  They are becoming a little loose.

Great as a starter.

Unfortunately, we played with a rule wrong, which made the game less strategic than it should have been.  Perhaps as a result, it hasn't seen further play since.  I would like to give it a shot with the correct rules, but there always seem to be many other fillers I would rather play.

Basically just a blind-bidding game that's strictly an opener/closer.  I could see playing it with kids.  The base mechanics reminded me of a really stripped down version of Fette Autos.  Players each have a figure that's in a line and each simultaneously reveal one of their cards (numbered 1-6).  If more than one person plays the same numbered card they are ignored.  Everyone else moves up to the top of the queue.  The lowest played card moves first.  Whoever is at the end of the queue then gets bit and loses a limb!  The bit-player then gets all their cards back and moves to the front of the queue.  Players are eliminated once they lose all their limbs... thus unable to swim away from the shark that swallows their torso.  The player in front of the queue when only two players is left is declared the winner.  A tad bit of deduction and cool bits.

Fun little filler game. I think most of the fun comes from pulling the limbs off the little plastic dudes, and the game itself is mostly guessing what the other players are going to do. Despite this, there does seem to be some room for strategy. Not the sort of strategy where you get a direct and immediate effect, but rather the sort of strategy where you're just trying to steer the odds in your favor a little bit each turn, and hoping that the cumulative effect over many turns will be that you win the game. But that's not a bad thing, especially for a light filler game, as it discourages AP.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/2E7eUCoXP-k

Get Bit is a card driven deduction/risk reward game, where you are trying to play the highest numbered card that no one else plays. Because it is simultaneous selection you don't know what everyone will play, but after the first round cards are left in front of people so you have a good idea. All this is too escape a shark as when you play a unique card the lowest moves to the front of the queue and then the next and so on, the person left at the back 'Get's bit!' What makes this great is the little figures and lego shark that come with the game. The figures can be dismembered and once they have been they are out of the game. My only complaint is that the game resolution is a bit weak but I don't have any better ideas!

Juego divertido y simple que funciona bien para niños. 
Este juego está ligeramente sobreproducido para dar algún sentido a su compra pues es 100% carne de print & play.

Los componentes son buenos, la nota baja es por lo simple del juego.
Le voy a dar más oportunidades a ver si cuela.

It's a funny game but too simple. I have the feeling that this version is slightly overproduced to justify a price for a game that fits better on the print & play games' cathegory.

I'm giving this one more chances in case it finds home.

RATING: 4
Simultaneous action selection, and sharks. The players each have a little "swimming" figure with detachable arms and legs: these are placed in a line across the table with a model shark chasing the hindmost. The players also have a deck of numbered cards. Each turn the players secretly select a card: ties cancel each other, so those players miss their turn. The others sequentially move their swimmer to the front of the line. The dude at the back of the line loses a limb to the shark (games this brutal are clearly aimed at the family/child market). Once someone is bitten they somehow teleport to the front of the line (adrenaline?). Rinse and repeat. When a player pawn loses all its arms and legs that person drops out. The winner is the leader on the turn when only two players are left.

I suppose there is clever bluff and counterbluff possible: Never go in against a Sicilian when being eaten by a shark is on the line. But I did remarkably well by drawing cards at random.

The figures are neat- kids would like Get Bit.

Easy to learn and to teach, this should be a good one to get non-gamers into. Players are swimmers in a row; a big bad shark lurks behind them; the last swimmer in the row, after players play cards, loses a limb (of the controlling player's choice). Arms and legs pop off the plastic human figures, so if you lose 4 times you're almost literally out. But the rules are designed so that if you lose a limb, you get to go to the front of the line, so by the time somebody loses 4 times, the game is nearing its end, so it isn't as though eliminated players end up sitting around twiddling their thumbs (or stumps) for a long time while others play on).

RATING: 5
It's taken the classic Raj game of simultaneous play from identical decks and turned it into a longer, less interesting game. But to be fair, they've added a fantastic theme to almost save it. Plays have hands of 1-7. Everyone sim-reveals a card. Anyone who matches doesn't move. Everyone who doesn't moves to the front of the line, from low card to high, meaning highest card will be at the front of the line and safe for a while. Whoever's at the back of the line loses a life, gets their cards back and moves to the front of the line as a catch-the-leader mechanism. Each turn, you either eye off who's at the back, see what cards they have left, guess what they're going to play and try and match them so they'll stay at the back and lose a life, or try and guess what everyone else will play and play something different so you'll move towards the front. With all the double-guessing that then goes on, good luck with that and each turn becomes a mini-lottery of randomness. As such, any initial charm from theme is soon swamped by just playing for the hell of it and the game dawdles too long for what it is. The winner? Whoever's at the front when the first swimmer loses their last life. Another lottery. May as well just roll a die and be done with it. But there is some thematic fun along the way, and the game at least gets points for the great bits.

Light weight game with pirate theme.  Uses bidding and deception mechanics.

RATING: 5
The game does have cute components, but it's really just a simultaneous action selection game.  There's really no strategy here, you could do just as well by picking a card at random.  Unless you can read minds, winning and losing is completely a matter of luck.

This is one of those games that's good for a one time play. It works great in a larger group of 4+ players. Feels more like an activity than a game, yet there's a little strategy inside. This might end up on the trade pile, once my children get bored about it. Never tried the expansions. Only works with four or more players, which is a shame!

I like this game, it is for family and for people who don't play. IT is not quite a gateway game, it is casual. 

The game is good but it won't make your guests want to play more, or make them want to come over to play some other day and know more games.

however, it is a good game

A very meh game. I will play occasionally but would far prefer most other fillers. There are few decisions to be made, and while you can somewhat try to anticipate your opponents to figure out what card to play, for the most part you are just playing a card and hoping it works out. Pretty sure randomly playing cards would win about as often as any other strategy.

RATING: 6
i know a five year old who loves this game, although he's a little iffy on whether the ultimate goal is to win or have fun (he tends to pick losing cards if he hasn't been bit in a while). the real game is in trying to pick a card that no one else is picking (matches slide to the bottom), a card that definitely matches with someone below you (you both slide, but they stay lowest), or just a high card. the bit person gets their cards back, everyone else leaves their played cards on the table. so, you can see there's some room to guess another player's hand after a while. it's probably supposed to be a cool thinky game in most groups, but in my experience half the people are playing random cards and the person with least health will end up matching repeatedly and die first. i might buy this again when the robots wear out, but only because my son plays with the robots more than the actual game.

The figures that come with the game are worth the purchase price alone in fun that you can have.  That there is actually an interesting blind bidding style game included is an added bonus.  If you pay attention to what is going on with the other players, there are some really interesting decisions to be made here as well as the opportunity for some really good tactical play.  Unfortunately, it is somewhat easy to be distracted by the game and not pay attention, leading to a game that have the general feel of it being awfully random.  So, you can take it serious or not and it doesn't break the game (though it may be less interesting to some of the others involved).  All in all, a very pleasant game.  [07/05/2008]

Oh, the wonderful doublethink. This game slowly grew up on me as I learned to appretiate the »subtleties« - when try to avoid what others are likely to play and when to copy them. The theme is a nice metaphore for swimming in groupthink – swimming against the shark. Components of tin can version are really cute and the one to get. The more I play it, the more I find it a perfect doublethink game and also am more and more fond of the doublethink myself.

Played once with 4P. I'm all for light blind-bidding games, but Get Bit! feels a little too light to leave an impact. The game mostly boils down to hoping that no other player has chosen the same number as you, and that other players have chosen the same number among themselves. It's an alright idea, except games like [thing=4475][/thing] have the same mechanism but with more meat on it.

It might be a good game to play with kids or non-gamers though. The whimsical game components are also a plus in its favour.

This game reminds me of the old joke about a bear chasing a pair of campers.  One camper starts tying his shoes, the other camper says "why are you doing that, you can't outrun a bear" and the first camper replies "I don't need to outrun the bear, I just need to outrun you".  In this game each player is a swimmer and the slowest swimmer loses a limb to a shark each round.

Each player has a hand of numbered cards and the slowest swimmer is determined (usually) by whoever plays the lowest numbered card.  The exception to this rule is if multiple players play the same number they do not move so will remain in the same relative position at the end of the line.  Also, once a card is played it cannot be played again until your hand is reset, which happens when you're bit or you are down to only one card in hand.

The game is cute, light, and quick.  The design also does provide for some occasional interesting decisions.  However there are also situations, which I've found come up much more often, where the game is easily solved.  By that I mean there are several rounds where a player can know with certainty that playing a specific number keeps them safe.  The last time I played the last round was such that there was no way (short of playing sub-optimally) that the three players left weren't going to finish in a specific order so there wasn't even a purpose to playing out the last round.

Another example is I started the same game at the front of the line, this makes it so that unless I make a mistake there is no way for me to get bit the first round by playing the third highest number (in a 4 player game) because either one person will play a lower number than me that way or someone will play the same number and I will remain ahead of that player.  Plus it still leaves me with the two highest numbers in my hand, so I don't even need to use one of my best resources.  I'm not at all interested in a game that gift wraps an advantage to a player at the start of the game like that.

This makes it not a game I particularly want to play.  There are much better light, quick, and cute games with much better design and interesting decisions.

RATING: 6.5
I was excited to try the shark game, in the end it is only okay. You try to anticipate which cards your opponents might play in order to play the right card that will get you far enough from the shark to not lose another limb. It is cute and fun yet a bit lame at the same time after a while. A classic filler which is good enough for what it is. I am simply not thrilled, that is all, but do like it. The theme and the idea of literally losing limbs it fantastic though, I kind of want to rate it higher for the theme but 6.5 is exactly how the game play feels to me.

{Mayday Games 11 edition] {party; simultaneous-action, double-guessing, player-elimination; optimal 5-6p}  Finally, I got a copy of it at the reprint and kick-start.

The new human figures and the shark are nice!!

However, the illustration of the cards is too pedestrian.  Why can't they take the chance to make it better?

It's not a bad game (especially for kids), but it really isn't my thing. It includes bluffing (I'm really bad at that), player elimination (I don't like my guests to sit around doing nothing), and even though it doesn't say so in the list of mechanics it feels very much like a "Take that" kind of game (not usually my thing either). The little plastic swimmers are fun to play with though.

Extremely impressive for a filler.  Short, sweet, and hugely fun in a twisted sort of way.  It's possibly overproduced, but that's part of its charm.  Definitely better with more players.  Title is oddly difficult to remember as my recall keeps insisting it's "Got Bit!" for some reason.

I love sharks, but this game isn't quite as good as I had hoped.  The little figures are cute and the game itself is alright, but I feel like that your options are a lot more limited while playing than it appears.  Look at what your opponent has played and play the right card in response.

[thing=30539][/thing] is an easy game, wich is some fun to play, but not all that much.

Every player has the same hand of cards at the start: cards numbered from 1 to 7. One card - the highest - is taken out by each player short of six players (so, with 5, the 7 is taken out; with 4, the 7 and the 6; and so on). In every round, the player chooses one card to play and everyone reveal their chosen card at the same time. If two or more of the same card are revealed, none of them take effect - only the cards with numbers that no one else choose will trigger. The cards move the sailor the number of spots ahead as the number in the card, and the lower numbers are resolved first. The goal is to keep distance from the shark. The sailor that is the last in the line is bitten by the shark and lose a body part - each sailor can lose up to three parts. The sailor is dead when he is bitten 4 times, thus the player is out of the game. Once a card is used, it stays in the discard plile, and the hand of cards is replenish only when every card is used, but the very last one used stays out there.

The game goes like until there are only two sailors left, then, the one closer to the shark will lose (no matter how many body parts he still has), and the one in front will be the winner.

[thing=30539][/thing] showed itself as a reasonable fun game. It is a short game, but the more players, the longer it gets (though the play is simultaneous, more players means more food for the shark, so it will take longer for him to eat all but two). Also, the dreaded player elimination, that isn't a big issue, when the game is really quick, as the more players you have, the worst the elimination gets.

Even with some issues, I will surely play it again if the opportunity arises, but [thing=30539][/thing] is definitely not in the same level as [thing=37759][/thing], [thing=172][/thing] and [thing=129622][/thing], all of which are, for me, better. However, [thing=30539][/thing] has one advantage: the visual, with the lego-like sailors and shark. It looks good in the table, and will call way more the attention of people passing by; and will also be easier to convince kids to play it (but, remember, the game has small parts).

[thing=30539][/thing] isn't a game I will recommend, but it doesn't offend also. Just an OK game, with some very nice (tasty?) bits.

I still wonder if this game offers any real gameplay. I can see how it can be funny with the right group, and the components take it to a higher level, but I am pretty sure that it takes a small part of the gameplay of bigger games (the blind bidding), only to represent it as a complete game. Still, happy to own it.

This is essentially Giro Galoppo with a better and more adult theme.  Problem is, I think Giro Galoppo (a kids game) is better because it's faster.  I found that Get Bit outstayed its welcome.

I don't like Get Bit. I first saw it on Tabletop and a friend of mine decided it looked fun enough to buy. We've played it a couple times since and I hope to never play it again. I really don't like Get Bit. I am not totally against blind auctions, but considering that this is all the game offers it becomes way too chaotic and luck driven. However, this isn't even my biggest gripes. First off there is play elimination problems (luckily it's a short game...even for the winners) and worst off is the super awkward ending. They really needed to figure out a better way to determine a winner. Get Bit has nice pieces, but should be played with like legos, not as a board game.

Those looking for deep strategy need not play this game.  There's a tactical bit of hand management here, but nothing so deep that it will take some experience with the game to crack it.  Look at what everyone else has played and aim to be higher than what anyone else can play to stay ahead of the pack.  There's actually a neat balancing mechanism where players who are ahead have more information on the table, but again, it's nothing terribly deep.  For a 15-minute game, though, it's a good bit of fun.

"You don't have to be faster than the shark, just faster than your friends!"
\13\\13\
Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark.
\13\\13\
The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!

My one play was okay, but not good enough that I'm interested in playing again. It's a quick filler where it's all about what everyone else has played, so it's a bit of a psychological game.

We've only played it once so far after buying it, with 3 people playing the long version (pulling off segments of limbs at a time). It wasn't that great.

The game's novel and offbeat theme - shark-driven appendage loss - is dampened by a nonsensical winning condition.  The winner should be determined by number of body parts remaining, not by whoever is first in line at game's end.

Amusing theme and cute components does not save pointless, chaotic game play.

Silly with a very tongue in cheek theme.  Although I'm not too fond of the semi-blind bidding mechanic, eventually your choice does become fairly obvious as the already played cards outnumber the ones held in hand.  Nothing too special, but could be fun for the right crowd.

I trade this away becuase noone I played it would seemed to enjoy it, but I think it's okay myself.

All the fun in this game, comes from the part of ripping of limbs of the robots. How fun is ripping of limbs? None at all, if you ask us. For the rest, it’s just about guessing which card your opponents will play. No fun in this one for us.

In my previous review, I’ve mentioned, that I’ll never say that a game is made for vertical storage, but the game I was talking about comes pretty close. Well, by playing Get Bit!, you’ll meet his friend and neighbor.

Awesome components in the small type box I love. It's a fun, simple game that anyone can play. I think this is one of the best indy games I have ever played, if not the best, both from originality and components.

meh, the parts are cheap, the stickers don't stay on, the idea is ok, but I'd rather play love letters or sushi go FWIW

Pár perces fun game, a leszedhető végtagok miatt elsőre poén, nyilván innentől már csak gyerekekkel érdemes elővenni, ők biztos többször is élvezik.

Fantastic light dice-chucking filler.  Only slightly more complicated than Zombie Dice and waaaaaaay better.

Oddly feels like a lot of downtime in a 4p game, though.

Inoffensive push-your-luck dice game suitable as a filler for groups of around 4 players.

Wonderful little dice-rolling game with well-written rules. I enjoy it more and more each time I play it. Have only played 2P so far. Acquired via Kickstarter.

I really like this publisher, dice, and trains. Why would I not like this game? No idea - it just wasn't for me.

Very quick little game. I actually wish it was a tiny bit longer although I only played with 2 players. Would be better if the objectives were a little more difficult. Their is also a flaw in that the first player to go has a significant advantage. Other than that, the game has just enough decision making to make it not feel like as much of a luck game as it really is. Choose when to use your card powers, when to use your locomotive token, and which dice to keep. My 9 year old learned this VERY easily and he loves trains so this was great to play a best of 3 with him. He was screaming and cheering across the house. Don't take this one too serious and you'll enjoy a nice little filler game. Components are good and in a nice little package. Easy to learn, light, and can be played in a small area the size of a tv tray. Works best if you have a dice tray to roll in.

Kickstarted

Trainmaker is a Kickstarter game that I've had sitting on my shelf for awhile. The initial read through of the rules made me hesitant to bring it to a game night... After having finally played it, its decidedly mediocre, its basically a modified Yhatzee. Players take turns rolling a set of dice looking to build a train and complete contracts. Contracts are the key to winning the game, either by collecting a contract of each type or by completing your secret objective. The first player to meet one of these condition wins. While this isn't a horrible game, its not one that's likely to ever be played again.

Nice little dice rolling game. Perhaps better as a multi-player game. Solo gameplay, as written, are a bit shallow. Will have to think about modifying the 2+ player rules and variants to see if I can get more out of the solo play.

Light/quick dice roller/push your luck sort of game.  You're trying to complete tickets by collecting sets indicated on your end-game bonus card.  First to complete their objectives triggers the end of the game.

Got this on Kickstarter in 2015.  

Surprisingly, I like this one a lot.  (Not craving it nightly, or anything, but one of the better Kickstarters I've picked up).  It's fast, there are secret missions, there are multiple ways to win, and you have some control  Even though I normally don't like dice-heavy games, this one is an exception.  

Fast to learn, light filler game to play.

A solid little Dice rolling game (with awesome, chunky, etched dice). Includes some slight but impactful modifications to the standard press your luck style of game. Greatly enjoyed player two player as well which is always a plus. The inclusion of separate games modes by other well known designers is a great bonus but the base Trainmaker gameplay should not be over looked. This will be hitting the table quite a for more times if I have my say.

My favorite dice game at the moment. Got to sit down and play it with the designer and had a blast. The addition of a train theme opens this game up and sucks you in. Two hardy thumbs up for this one!

A bit of the old random dice chucking, but rather than just being a push your luck game it adds a small bit of strategy with the different abilities of the cards.

This game is ok.. The luck to strategy ratio is just a little higher than I might prefer, but it is not a bad game at all to play. Taking the dice and actually putting them together to make a train is kind of fun, and there is a good satisfaction of completion when finishing a train and claiming the card

Great family dice chucker.  Nice, high quality components: awesome custom dice, nice graphics on cards, cool wooden pieces.  Fits in a nice compact box.  Fun mechanic of using the dice to build trains to complete stations.  The stations contain a resource and/or a train car that you can use to complete secret objectives. Games are fairly quick- one of the first games we grab when only have 15 minutes until bedtime.

SOLOABLE. Rating is tentative and based on solo play only. One of these days the kids will actually be willing and able to play a more complicated game with me, right?

Trainmaker is one of those games I knew I was going to like as soon as I saw it. A fun filler game that usually doesn't last more than 10 minutes. The components are excellent and designed so well. I also love the press your luck aspect of it. I can't speak for the mini-games that also come with it (because I haven't tried those yet) but the main game is excellent just by itself.

An excellent 10-15 minute filler dice game. I backed the Kickstarter and have been very pleased with the game. Best, I think, with 3 players, but even a 6 player game was not bad, and it has worked well as a 2 player game also.

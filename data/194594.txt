10/10/17 - Played again and I've figured it out: this is a great game for 3+ players and a terrible game for 2 players. At 3+ player counts, the luck is mitigated, there's more rolls due to kicked-out actions, and it's almost impossible for one player to get all the good cards. Playing this game with 3 or more players fixes all its' problems. It makes it a fun, rather short engine-builder that keeps you invested during other peoples' turns. But if you don't have at least 3 players to play it with, my opinion is that you should not play it at all. Also, the set-up is way shorter with 3+ players as you don't have to remove half the die faces for sale in the beginning and then put them back in the correct order when cleaning up. 

09/22/17 - Nice art, love the dice-building, but the game is just too lucky for me. One could argue I built a better engine than my opponent, but as far as I could tell, she was endlessly upgrading her dice faces and yet rolling terribly while I was getting value from pretty much every upgrade that I did get and taking two turns a round.

Dice Forge is a pretty fun game and one that looks absolutely gorgeous! 

In fact it must be one of the most beautiful products I've seen in a long time. The artwork is bright and crispy, the dice are big and chunky. The visual appeal of the game is so strong that it enhances the overall experience of the game. However I wish the cardboard and card stock quality would have been higher. Unfortunately the cards, the board and the player boards bend easily, quickly and a lot. It's not an incredibly huge deal, but surely something that puts a dent on the otherwise high production values of Dice Forge.

As far as game-play is concerned, Dice Forge offers a light but pretty fun experience. You get to customize your dice and roll them a lot, gather resources and spend them to get even more out of your dice rolls. It's fun and it's easy to grasp, even if the game requires a considerable time for the explanation because of all the symbols. I do however wish that the game could offer a wider variety of die faces and cards to allow for more strategies and different combos, but I'm sure that expansions will come out to do just that.

As it is, Dice Forge is a light, fast and fun game. It goes over well with various crowds and fits different situations. I like it very much and I'm eagerly waiting for expansions to have more.

Almost immediately forgot about the game after playing it once. It looks pretty and tries to cash in on glitz via the dice rolling and dice upgrading, but ultimately it's just a slimmed down deck builder style game. Grab something from the market to upgrade your hand. Next round, decide between upgrading again or grabbing points. It feels  like a filler weight Dominion.

For the cost and shelf space, I would still prefer to buy Star Realms. For a big box game, the extra value should be going to support extra mechanisms and/or story, and it should be longer than 30 minutes. Spending the money on an overproduced filler seems like you're just going to realize 3 games in that there's not much game in the box and you've wasted space on empty calories.

I don't love dice games but had an unexpectedly good time with this. Dominion with dice, easier to grasp (family friendly) and much more luck-oriented. Technically, the dice construction works without a hitch. The art on the cards and board is beautiful. Player interaction is minimal, on the level of Dominion. Set-up and tear-down is more fiddly and time-consuming than average.

Dice Forge is an engine builder with a gimmick - Instead of building up a tableau of stat cards in front of you, you swap out the faces on your dice to make them better.

It's a cool concept, and this game pulls it off spectacularly. The components are some of the most solid game components I've seen in a box, and the $40 retail price feels like a steal.

The game is simple, but it's fun. Since players roll dice and gain resources *every* turn, instead of only on their turn, you don't usually feel stuck with bad luck like you might in other engine-builder games. You can usually at least do *something* on your turn, and it feels great to pry the faces off dice and put new, better faces on them.

First, the dice. Changing the faces is easy, it doesn't need any sort of tool as some have suggested, just use the new face to ease off the one being replaced. 
As for the game, it is medium-light engine-building romp. The use of three different currencies is very interesting. You start by wanting gold, the currency used to buy new dice faces (but which cannot buy cards). Then you'll want faces that generate sun and moon shards, the currencies used to buy the cards. None of these currencies are worth anything at the end of the game, so the big strategic decision is when to stop upgrading your engine and instead go for victory points. 
Having two dice also makes for fun decisions. For instance, one tactic is to concentrate on making first one "strong" dice with upgraded faces, then putting say one or two "x3" faces on the other dice that treble the value of those upgraded faces.
It's all over in about an hour with next to no down time because everyone rolls each turn, whoever the active player might be. This frequency of rolling also mitigates against a run of bad throws.
All in all, great fun.

Dice Forge is another evolution in the X-building genre: after Dominion (deckbuilding), Quarriors (dice-pool building), Mystic Vale (card building)... here we have the dice building mechanic!
Each player has a couple of dice and rolls them at the beginning of each turn, generating various kinds of resources/currencies. These are used, during the player own turn, to buy stuff, with the most interesting being new faces for the dice!
The system, while its description may seem bland, it's kinda engaging.
The overall result is a quasi-family game, quite fast paced and entertaining.

Very interesting game. It was better than I expected. Very fun to acquire better die faces and "scrap" the starter faces. The way you forge your dice can involve a lot of strategy as you improve them to give you a better chance to achieve the goals you have set for yourself. The games goes pretty fast and seems to scale well. However, I'd still prefer a similar game with cards as the constantly changing the die faces, etc. seems very fiddly. Additional plays have caused me to think this is just too random, nothing more than a dice chucking fest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great "dice building" game where you have customizable dice that get you resources that you then use to buy better die faces or cards that give you special powers. The production of this game is outstanding with vibrant art, durable plastic die pieces, and one of the best inserts you'll ever see included with a game. Gameplay is both fast and fun. Turns go fairly quick as you're usually just buying one or two things. Even when it's no your turn you still get to roll which is great. The game comes with extra sets of cards to add more variability after you've played with the base set a few times. I really don't have anything negative to say about this game. It's a great option for kids as well as adults since this is on the lighter side. Seasoned gamers may find it too light but that's hardly the game's fault. An excellent option when you want a low-stress dice-chucker that plays in under an hour.

Our second new to us game on our Friday night game-a-thon. 3 player game, Brian, Brett and myself. Final scores 103-100-98. This was a real surprise! I picked it up at my FLGS on a whim because I saw Tom Vasel's review. There is quite a lot of strategy here for such a light game. How do you build up your dice? I went for VP and gem faces. Brian went all money and Brett did a mixture. All strategies seemed valid. The replacing die face mechanism was new to me and quite fun. The cards were extremely powerful and were the deciding factor in our game. We did make 1 rule mistake, which was only allowing 1 copy of a card to be sold to each player. Perusing of BGG forums shows that you can get multiple copies of the same card, which will lead to a more cutthroat game for sure. This will stay in the collection as I think I could teach this to non-gamers with much success. Also, this has the greatest insert of any game I have ever seen. Wow, is it amazing!

The innovative concept in this game is a pseudo deck-building mechanic where you are replacing the faces of the two dice that you are rolling to better options. The components and cards are pretty to look at, but the game itself is something that we've seen before and your standard Euro-fare of building your engine to acquire better things. I guess this would have impressed me when I first started the hobby, but now it just seems inoffensive and bland. The dice are cool and it does play quickly though!

In "Dice Forge" you are modifying your dice and buying power up cards in order to score points and gain abilities. The game is quick (30-45 min) and revolves around getting resources from your dice, which can be improved to get more and better resources. While it occasionally feels a little too short, I love the mechanics in this game and dice work really well.

Highly recommend!

RATING: 5
A mediocre game with little substance, Dice Forge feels like an overgrown filler with a bland gameplay: you keep hoarding resources to improve your dice but in the end you don’t even need to swap any panes on your Lego dice in order to win; you simply have to grind as many lower-priced cards as you can just to raise your victory points quickly and almost free of charge.

There’s little meat beneath the stunning components here.

Cool fresh concept of building dice.  Game feels like it does give you enough time to develop an engine, and does have good variety even in the base box as there are different cards to swap in.  Begging for expansions as well.  Wish the dice were a little easier to swap the faces on / off.

The artwork is the best part of the game -- very pretty, but also completely unnecessary. For a build-your-own-dice game, I think Rattlebones is better. There just didn't seem to be a lot of strategy, other than "When in the game should I shift from engine-building to point generation?" Dominion has that too, but this game doesn't have Dominion's replayability or focus on combo-building.

A dice fest in which you need to have real life screwdrivers at the table as you build different facings on bouncy plastic dice. You roll dice on everyone's turns to generate different currencies.

A fun little engine-building dice game, with really nice customizable dice that are very easy to change out.

I'm hoping an expansion is coming, which might bring something more interesting to the table because as it is, it's just a little bland for me.

As far as I know, the first dice-crafting game, which turns out to be a very neat little gimmick. The game is easy to learn and teach and plays in about 30 minutes after setup. Players roll for resources and can purchase new sides for their dice with gold or spend fire or moon tokens to buy cards to give special powers. The dice-crafting is a really interesting mechanism and I like the asymmetry created by everyone's special powers, but I just wish there were a little bit more mitigation for dice rolls. Even though you've upgraded your dice, you could really fall behind just by rolling the "basic" sides for a few turns. Nevertheless, the simple gameplay, the colorful artwork and the big chunky dice definitely make this game a good and quick gateway.

Wow, this game really caught me by surprise especially being from the school of "Dice Hate Me", games.  The twist is now, How can I make dice love me? and it works. It really does, I found my self blasting the big chunky dice and yelling...of cuorse my strategy was simple. Load up one dice with VP and he other with the multiplier and chase down some high value cards. In the end I couldn't pull off enough good rolls and maybe dice still don't love me...but now at least I know they can't hate me. Well done, really looking forward to see how the Dice Forge Universe ultimately expands.

A hard game for me to gauge. It's a rapid engine building game as you use the first few rounds to buy better dice faces and then the last few rounds to run your engine and hopefully bring in the points. The problem for me is the game has the weight of a gateway game feeling relatively simple as you mostly convert resources into points, but it requires gamers to understand how to play with the iconography as to what you do and get the game flow down. Further the setup and teardown even with the amazing insert is still a lot of work with all the different card areas and constructing the dice. That may keep the game on the shelf more often than not, for now it's a keeper but maybe not for long. I want to try it with some of the other cards to see if they are a bit more fun.

The good news about "Dice Forge" is that its core mechanic - its customizable dice - works reasonably well and makes this reasonably fun to play. The bad news is that I'm not inclined to play again, not because the game is bad but because it's SO damn fiddly. The pieces, I mean. They're EVERYWHERE. Die faces here, die faces there! And every turn, you're going to need to pry one or more faces off your dice. Good luck with that, or at least good luck not breaking a fingernail in the process.

There's also the issue of the cards, which rely heavily on symbology. You can't succeed at "Dice Forge" without understanding those cards, and you can't understand them unless you play enough to acquaint yourself with their symbols. That wouldn't be a deal-breaker if this game were amazing. But it's merely good, so I'm never going to play enough to learn those symbols, meaning, I'll never be good enough to want to play more. Vicious circle!

Light, but engaging dice crafting game with a slight tableau-building element. The crafting of the dice adds a tangible element that keeps players engaged, and the gameplay is very smooth. Wish there were more strategy or depth, but nothing that expansions cant add.

RATING: 7
Setup and tear down is way too long for the kind of game it is.
If it took 30 seconds to set-up and another 30 to tear down, this would've been one of the best filler game of 2017.

For some reason, probably because of the racing nature of the game to score the highest point in a surprising low number of turns, the game feels tense... really tense, To the point of being even stressful for me. This is at odd with the look of the game, which evokes a peaceful design.

As it is, we barely play it.

This game is a ton of fun, and it became an instant hit with my game group. My group really likes deck building games and dice chucking games so grabbing this was an easy choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Other publishers should take note. This game has one of the best inserts I've ever seen. Everything has it's place. It's super fast to setup/teardown.

Now as far as the game itself. Wow! If you like chucking dice this game is definitely for you! It's so simple and yet feels so satisfying because you get to change the faces on your dice. Although you could argue this game is just pure luck based I'd say that there are plenty of choices to be made between which faces and cards you purchase that gives the game enough strategy to keep the game interesting.

The artwork/production is fantastic which will remind you of the designer's previous game Seasons.

I had never heard of this until I saw a demo of it during DTC.  Tried it the next morning, and went home with it that weekend.  Fun little quick game. I didn't think I was a fam of dice games before, but this one I enjoyed a lot.  The only down time is waiting for the other players to change their dice faces.  Plays better with 4 than with 3, and have yet to try it with two.  Rating may go up if 2 player is as fun as the 4 player.  Even 3 is fun, although a bit shorter than the 4 player game.

RATING: 6
An economic engine game based on dice rolls. It's hard to accomplish a balanced game given how important early turns are to building your engine.  If you biy dice faces but can't roll them early it is a wasted investment...or a windfall in momentum if you get lucky.   Still it seemed to work pretty good as you roll enough that things tend to average out.  Happy to play again but not going to seek it out.

Well I can’t be convinced to play this again, but it’s not broken.  It’s just not fun.  Legit, here’s how you play: roll, move resources up.  Roll, move resources up.  Roll, move resources up.  On your turn, roll, move resources up, spend resources to build dice or gain a power.  Back around the table to roll and move resources up until your next turn.  I mean............................. seriously??

RATING: 6
Upon first play, it's too fiddly, luck based and unclear what would make good paths to victory. I think it'd be a good investment, if you were to play it lots and lots, but frustating just once. You can mitigate bad rolls, but lucky early rolls could lead to runaway victories. Cool idea though, and I'd definitely play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is beautiful and comes with one of the best inserts ever. If not taking terribly seriously, the game is light, fast moving, and engaging to play. The longevity may not be there as the strategy arcs are not too numerous, so you simply just go through the motion of the game with the excitement of hoping your crafted dice perform well.

I wouldn't want to own it, as I'd likely only take it out to teach new players. If played every so often it is fine as a pick up game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dice-building is exactly as fun as you'd think. Popping out faces, and acquiring new ones, gives the game a nice sense of progression. Best of all, players roll their dice A LOT, so players have ample opportunity to play with their toys. The trial cards offer a decent amount of variability, but Dice Forge is too light to warrant several plays. While, I won't be picking up a copy myself, Dice Forge is a very fun game that you won't regret playing twice or thrice.

Credit to the publisher(s) who used just the right design to make the dice (and hence the game) work. 
Whenever we've seen this in an event library, it's been in use constantly!
Can be taught in under 10 mins - and plays almost too quickly because it's over before you're ready to stop playing.

Dice Forge is a board game from Libellud that challenges you to harness your powers and challenge up to three other players in a battle for dominance. During the game, your dice provide the resources you need, but throughout the game, you’ll change your dice, snapping new faces on and improving your chances of claiming victory. When the gods call an end to your contest, the player with the most glory wins the game.

RATING: 6
A clever gimmick that hides its bog-standard pool-building tropes, tricking you into thinking that it is doing something new.  There is something unquestionably satisfying about rolling improved dice, though, and that you're rolling on everyone's turn adds to the satisfaction. This does not scale down well at all, performing best at 4. The 4-resource economy is well-balanced and allows for you to have meaningful choices, even when you are at the mercy of dice randomness.  

The production and aesthetic is worth mentioning, as an exception to my general reluctance to remark on trivial characteristics that are going to strike different people differently.  The insert and packaging are perfect, the graphic design is quite legible (despite some odd choices in the placement of some iconography) and the art is pleasing without distracting from the themeless mechanisms of play.

First play impressions.  Quick paced, if it weren't for the difficulty in removing dice face tiles.  Component quality and artwork is fantastic.  Surprised it's not themed in the Xidit world.  Will have to see how the components hold up (specifically the dice face tiles) and how much depth of strategy there is to discover upon more plays.

RATING: 7
This is an enjoyable game, as creating your dice is very satisfying. After one game, I suspect that the game play will be short and leaving me wanting more. It also seems like the setup & cleanup to actual play ratio may not be the best. It's very fiddly, but the game play does make up for most of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice game, as every one says the insert is phenomenal. Although it is inherently based on luck there is some strategy to the game as to how much emphasis you put on increasing your ability to roll VPs or gain crystal shards to purchase cards for VPs. With limited rounds (9rnds for 2 or 4 players and 10 rnds for 3 players) there isn't much time to change tactics mid game. Christmas 2017 from April

A great experience. I was a little skeptical before I started (yet another overrated "gimmick game"?). However, I was very surprised about this game. The game flow is perfect, changing the bits were not fiddly at all, and the cards and interaction were interesting. I recommend this game, and the rating might even go up after repeated plays. Do we have a Spiel des Jahres 2018 here?

RATING: 4
Actually fairly disappointed in this one. Game play is very very simple and choices fairly obvious. We used half the cards present in the game and so there IS scope to change the game play up a little... but honestly I still think it would be rather repetitive. 

The dice building which is the central mechanic is very fiddly and some players struggled to remove faces, and resulted in several die faces pinging off and having to be retrieved from the floor. Adding a simple tool to assist in this removal (like the lego games do) would have improved this greatly

The dice themselves are very lightweight and not very satisfying to roll:(, but the rest of the components are very good, and indeed the insert will even hold the cards once sleeved :surprise: but overall I find this is far to simple and lack options and choices.

Sold in a board game bundle in 2017.

RATING: 9
Sharp, quick, and excellent production value. It's lightning quick to learn and teach, engaging at all times rather than simply at your turn, and despite how fast it plays it catches you by surprise at how well it's strategy matures from early to mid to end game rather than simply feeling "that's it? we're done?". The craftable dice are neat with a familiar evolution from the deck building and bag building mechanic while also bringing new considerations to the table when it comes to building the dice. Finally, it has the sexiest inlay I have ever seen. By far, no dice.

A nagy hype a gyönyörű kinézet és a némileg egyedi megoldások miatt nagyon érdekelt. Tudtam, hogy családi jellegű, és így a szerencsefaktor nem elhanyagolható. Sajnos mindezek ellenére csalódás volt. A szerencsefaktor még a számításaimat is felülmúlta, ráadásul tipikusan az a pofádbamondós. Lúzer vagy. Ez nekem azért eléggé csökkenteni tudja az örömfaktort. :) Ezt esetleg még betudnám ízlésbeli kérdésnek, de az, hogy egy ilyen játékot 15 perci kell elpakolgatni, szerintem már kifejezetten tervezési hiba. Pont akiknek leginkább szólna, azok nem fognak erre időt szánni, hanem visszadobálják az egészet a dobozba. Majd legközelebb, mikor játszanának szembesülnek az állapotokkal és hagyják a fenébe az egészet. Ez így összességében szerintem elég gyengus lett, pure eyecandy.

Ludicrous, non-existent theme, but plays in a reasonable length of time.  Not much time to create an engine, so gaining extra turns/actions is paramount.

Variable Würfel, deren Seiten man selbst bestimmen kann, sind die kreative Idee von DICE FORGE. Was mir zunächst nach einem l'árt pour l'árt Mechanismus roch, der sich selbst überhöhen möchte, zeigte sich dann doch recht verspielt: die Plastik-Plättchen für die Tauschseiten-Würfel lassen ein nostalgisches Gefühl von Fischer Technik aufkommen. Jenseits der netten Spielzeug-Idee ist DICE FORGE jedoch ein "Ich-erwürfle-mir-Ressourcen-für-Siegpunkte-oder-direkt-Siegpunkte-Spiel". Karten, die das eigene Würfelglück verbessern, gibt es natürlich auch. Der etwas fingerkuppenstressige Fischer Technik Würfel-Neubau und das Geklapper der Plastikwürfel macht auch Spaß, bleibt aber wie bei jedem reinen Würfelspiel halt ein Glücksspiel, wenn auch ein kreativ getuntes mit nahezu null Downtime. DICE FORGE packt Würfel an seiner Wurzeln, verharrt aber auch an der Oberfläche seines eigenen Glitzers. Bei aller Schönheit fehlt DICE FORGE am Ende trotz seines unterhaltsamen Flairs dann doch der gewisse Hook, auch wenn die schönen, bunten, sehr französischen Illustrationen alles dafür tun. Régis Bonnessées HIMALAYA bleibt unerreicht.

I enjoyed playing this somewhat light dice/resource game. For starters the art and production is really very good. The dice changing mechanic of the game is perhaps the most interesting part (even thought the faces are difficult to remove). Overall it is just a decent ok game, one that I would enjoy playing again but not one I would rush to play. I didn't really feel the theme really mattered much during game play as it is simply pasted over. The Dark Crystal imagery and fonts are an obvious play on marketing and doesn't have much if anything to do with the game.

RATING: 5
The idea of physically improving your dice, seen before in "Rattlebones", is interesting in theory, but annoyingly fiddly in practice. The rulebook recommends using the new die face to remove the old one, but that doesn't quite work, sometimes causing it to spring high and across the table. A friend said there is a simple way to do it just with your fingers, but I haven't had the opportunity to test it.

The gameplay is simple: roll your dice to get resources, use gold to buy better die faces or sun and moon shards to buy cards. It's also very random, with no way to manipulate die rolls. You have a few choices, but they are awfully restricted by the dice. It's frustrating to buy a pair of new die faces and keep rolling your basic "1 gold". That is even worse if another player gets his new shiny face on his next roll, which may result in a snowball effect. I also dislike the potential kingmaking effect of generating resources for an opponent when you buy a card from the same area of his last purchase.

I don't think there is much to keep serious gamers interested after a couple of plays, but the game should work well for families and casual players. It also looks very nice on the table, with the colorful main board, the card art seamlessly extending it, and the box being used as a building (like in "Cleopatra and the Society of Achitects").

Family game, player interaction is absimal. 
The gimmick of "forging" the dice works quite well, and all materials are of an extremely good quality.
I guess that the game will feel a bit stale after 10-20 plays tops.

This is an innovative game. The "dice crafting" mechanism allows each player to upgrade and change their dice to suit their strategy. By the end of the game everyone's dice is different and that's the great about the game. The way the resources are spent on those cards are nothing special. I wish there are ways for the cards to build even better engine for the game but I suppose that would make the game more complicated than what it sets out to do. Probably an expansion will make this more of a gamer's game.

Dice Forge, while not a very deep game, features satisfying gameplay as well as quality art and components... except for the most crucial component of all - the dice themselves. It is way too tricky to remove and replace the die faces, requiring a good bit of force and dexterity. And while the rule that players get to roll the dice even when its not their turn limits downtime, the game can't continue until dice customizations are finished. This slows the game down, which is a shame - because otherwise, I'd recommend this as a fun, fast game.

A little like Istanbul in building up resources (along with being able to extend the size of your wheelbarrow so you can hold more of each resource) but basically a dice game where you have only 2 dice but you buy "upgrades" for the 6 sides of each dice.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (Jul 2017)

I really like Seasons a lot and I also enjoy Lords of Xidit so I was very keen to play the next game designed by Régis Bonnessée, after playing it, I can say I was expecting a heavier game, but I still enjoyed it.

The rules of the game are very simple to learn. The rulebook only has two pages. You can explain it under 8 minutes. I have played it under 60 minutes, so it plays very fast.

Dice Forge has a cool theme but you don’t feel it through the game.

Best with 3 fast players. With 4 layers the downtime is way too much for such a simple game, perhaps if all players are familiar with the cards it can flow a lot faster. I really hate high downtimes in games.
 
The game´s components are amazingly well done, the player´s boards came unpunched already, the dice are big and cool. The art is very good as well. The insert is also very functional and well done. Libellud always pays attention to these things.

The game´s decisions aren’t as complex as I expected, on your turn and on your opponents turn you throw the dice to get resources. The core of the game is to assemble said dice to support your strategy (I hope the dice won´t get damaged easily). You can also accomplish feats (buy cards) to get VPs and other abilities. This part of the game is novel and fun if all players move at a quick pace. I hoped for a harder game, but the decisions are rather simple. I like very much how you assemble the dice and how you improve them to increase the probability to get the resources you want.

Luck plays a role in the game, but in my games the player who played the best strategy has won every time, so, I'm inclined to believe the luck factor is under control most of the time.

Dice Forge comes with more cards than you use in one game, so it seems it has a high replayability factor, still, I expect expansion will come soon as it is easily expandable just with more cards. I´m afraid the game will become too repetitive soon.

After some games, I feel that perhaps the game is unbalanced. I feel it is more important to get sun shard that to get anything else, the reason, they allow you to play two actions instead on one in your turn. I hope this isn’t the case.

Bottom line, I was expecting a heavier game, but it is still fun to play. Dice Forge is a family level game, and as such, I don’t want to play it too often. It is one of the few family games I will be keeping among my game collection for the time being, my SO loved the game as did every friend who has played it. It has great production values. The idea of the game is fascinating to me and I already bought the other game in which you assemble your dice (Rattlebones). For now, Dice Forge is a borderline 7.0 to me, barely a good game.

Dice Forge is a very innovative game! Forging new sides on the dice is very fun, and after a few plays it seems there are many ways to win, which adds strategy and replayibility to the game. The Greek mythology theme is nice, although it seems pasted-on. I'm hoping an expansion will be released soon!

Dice Forge is very light and plays quickly. The design cleverly capitalizes on the fun that dice rolling offers by allowing every player to roll on every other player's turn. The actual dice crafting is fun, and this model of customizable die is an improvement over Rattlebones'. The production is terrific and the game is easily taught/learned. Recommended for those looking for a unique addition to family game-night fare.

RATING: 7.5
A dice drafting game in which you are actually changing the face of your dice.  It has a fantasy theme ... but you won't even notice.  There are two things you are doing in this game.  You are customizing your dice and you are visiting different locations to gain special permanent abilities or points from cards.  How you build your dice matters.   Which cards you get matter.  The idea is to have the best synergy of your two dice and your cards.  In Dice Forge, you are drafting dice when its not your turn, so you are always engaged.

It takes at least one full game to understand the relative strength of the cards and the dice ability.   Since there is a limited quality of cards and dice faces, that is important.  There is little chance of a first time player winning their first play.

Replacing your dice sides seems a little bit fiddly.  Occasionally they will pop off and you will have to look for them.  There are four scoring-type tracks to manage and grasping the special dice ability and special card abilities, which might be too much for a new gamer.  These concepts aren't difficult; it will just take a while to learn how to optimize them.  There are better gateway games.  

For me, Dice Forge falls in the uncomfortable space of being too long to be a filler, too fiddly and too many synergies to be a good gateway, but too light to be a main event.

I would gladly play it again, but there is no reason for me to own it.

I'm enamored with the toy factor of this game. I loved messing with the dice and just getting shape how my dice worked and looked. I will have to play a few more times to commit it to a 10, but it will likely end up there. It is exactly what I want in a game, an experience that is fun, win or lose, over anything else.

This is pretty much Dominion: The Dice Game. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy Dominion and the only reason I enjoy Dice Forge more is because it is dice. However, I know for a fact that dice ruins the game in terms of strategy. Well, either way, I did not enjoyed the game.

Dice Forge is a solid, light weight game, where you finally get to make the dice you dream of rolling.  This is a great family game (beware of flying die faces) and a solid gateway into more complex resource management games.   It helps that the components are of a good quality (namely the dice and faces) and the art is beautiful.  A fully functional insert also helps.

Not only is this a great family weight game, I think it actually adds something new to the deck building genre. The dice crafting system, rather than being a gimmick, turns an advanced technique -- deck thinning -- into a simple mechanism accessible by everyone. It really opens up the more strategic aspects -- to get his benefit what should I give up -- to younger and more casual players. I look forward to expansions and more games using dice crafting.

Remek móka, ráadásul elég innovatív mechanika. Kellően kellemes, gyors, egyszerű, gondolkodtató. A szerencse természetesen ott van, de rengeteget dobunk egy játszma alatt, alapvetően minden bizonnyal kiegyenlítődik, még ha könnyű is úgy érezni, hogy másoknak jobban jönnek az eredményesebb oldalak. A megjelenés, kivitelezés pazar, van interakció (pozitív), ha akarjuk, kiszúrás is lehet benne, szóval sokszínű, érdekes játék.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really enjoyed this one in my first play outside of struggling to get the die faces off the die which often resulted in flying die faces onto the carpet, etc. Gotta change my technique I suppose. The game itself is interesting as you build two different dice to gain the most points in the end. You can purchase either a dice face or a card on your turn but not usually both unless you take a double turn by spending two fire. There are different cards and dice faces to make each game unique but I can see this likely needing an expansion or two pretty quickly to stay interesting/fresh. It does make for an interesting 30-45 minute opener/closer.

Extremely unique game where you are building custom dice.  On your turn you buy a card which gives you a special ability, or you can buy a face that you add to your dice.  You get resources after each player roles and you collect what you role.  There are moon, fire, gold resources.  

The game is really fun.  The different setups add to replay-ability.  

The only annoying element is that you have to wait for people to put their die face on.  It can take time and slows the game down.  

The game still doesn't take that long.  Fun, simple game.

La particolarità del titolo sta nella meccanica "Dice-Crafting". Ogni giocatore ha i suoi due dadi personali le cui facce producono oro e risorse, con i primi si comprano altre facce per potenziare i propri dati (le 6 facce si staccano fisicamente dai dadi) mentre con le risorse si fanno le "quest" per sbloccare altre facce più rare o ottenere punti e bonus permanenti al gioco.
Possibilità di rigiocare col medesimo gruppo grazie ai due set di carte "quest" che è possibile alternare a piacere durante il setup del gioco.
Molto consigliato per i neofiti

I bought this game specifically because I wanted to roll custom dice and this game [of course] does this very well. The concept is great and I love the execution. I really like adding new faces to my dice and I really like acquiring the cards on the board. 

I do have a number of qualms about this game that I dislike. By far, the biggest thing I dislike are the cards that negatively affect the other players. This includes a few cards that cost 3 moon or sun shards like rolling the dice and everyone loses the stats they roll. I also dislike the "force your opponent to forge a bad dice face" that ultimately benefits another player. It doesn't feel fun when you have 4 to 6 new dice faces and you roll a negative face or continue to roll the +1 gold faces. Additionally, I don't think the game has enough turns. I find myself telling others that we should play to round 10 (or even turn 11). I would of course consider that a house rule.

Even though there are a number of things I don't like about this game, my friends and family find it very interesting and worth some replay value. Personally, I would really, really like to see more card variety in the purchasing pool. For E.G. I have only 1 card option to buy for a number of slots. It would be nice to have 2 in every option. A small expansion with cards and maybe a few other dice faces would make this game much more fun. 

Overall a solid game.

Fun game marred by weak rules. Rules take 5 times as long as game play does so we shall have to play this at least 12 more times to get my $ worth, but only twice on a 'tuesday'. We will!

The promo cards are a waste of time.

Would be an 8 if there was some more variability with setup and scoring, variable player powers (special unique die face each character starts with) as well as hidden private goals would be awesome too. Hoping for an expansion to take care of all that! 2-player felt a bit exhausting with the double rolls, I enjoyed it most with 3 so far!

It may be a gimmick, but the changing die faces are very cool, and the game attached to it is exciting. The dice are basically a customizable slot machine. Then you use whatever the slot machine gave you to build a cute little point engine.

RATING: 6
A neat light dice customization game. Changing up the dice is always fun, and it feels good to roll for resources on all players turns.

It has a fair bit of downtime when other players are deciding what to do. Probably better with fewer players.

The cards you can get can be quite OP if one player gets multiple of one type (for example the bear). Feels like the game needs quite a lot of self-balancing between the players to make up for crazy cards, which is hard for newer players, but with the weight of the game being so light I'm not sure who this is for.

Well this game has high production value talking of the dice. But I don t like two things about the design. Victory Point scale should be on the top - the 10s above the 1s and I don t get it why the symbol language is very hard to read (not the language but the printing).

The game is OK and I thought yesterday about a wargame with those variable dice chits, which might be as much fun. I stay with my card deck building games.

A nice implementation of the dice construction mechanisms. All players rolling on every turn is a good idea. I'm not a fan of the take that cards, and the base card setup is actually quite dull, so starting configuration is a strong factor in enjoyment. It's fun enough.

Great production values (Particularly for the price) but I've only placed once with two players, which doesn't seem to be where this game shines.  Might end slightly too soon to enjoy your custom dice.

This game is from the same designer of Seasons and Lords of Xidit, both games I really like. This one is no different. Game play is a really simple but clever dice-crafting game. Artwork is stunning. My son liked it as well - not too difficult for his age (6) and he even managed to win. It fullfills the high expectations I had for it.

Love the Forging of the dice element! The rolling is also cool because you roll in every player turn, so you are always engage in the game... 
It's fast and it's fun... the art is very good! But in the end the luck factor is very high... you can have many excellent die faces but if you don't roll them they won't do you no good!

Docked 1/2 point for dice faces a bit too difficult to remove. One of few literal dice builder games, Dice forge works in just about the simplest way possible for a game about constantly adding better face to your dice. There is always a sense of progression, and the angst that comes with poor dice rolls over its set rounds. Worth a play, but I don't think this outclasses the other dice building game, Rattlebones.

RATING: 3
What a snoozefest this turned out to be. After having played Rattlebones, I hoped that a couple of years with the customized dice mechanic being "out there" would yield to better uses of it. Unfortunately, that isn't the case here.

Everything about Dice Forge looks gorgeous, but that's the best I can say for this game. All you do every turn is roll both of your dice and gain the resources on them. Then you have the option of buying a new die face or buying a card that lets you perform a special action and/or gives you a lasting benefit along with points. Occasionally you can roll your dice more often in a turn, but there's not much else going on besides that.

This felt like the equivalent of a roll-and-move game, where all you're really doing is rolling dice to get resources. It's all random, and sometimes you can't even do anything on your turn. I really, really disliked this, even moreso than Rattlebones. At least in Rattlebones you had a choice of which of your monkeys to move around the board. Here you're just performing actions based on what the dice spit out for you.

Played twice last night and it was a hit!  Really fun swapping out the sides and hoping what you did pays off for your strategy.  Not sure how luck dependant it is yet obviously with dice rolling there is a big luck factor but there are lots of things to do to help yourself as the cards add some very interesting decisions.  It's a great light, yet strategic game that could be fun for almost all levels of players.

[b]Dice Forge[/b] was sold via auction 2/17/18.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I picked up Dice Forge because I enjoyed the dice crafting aspect of Rattlebones and thought Dice Forge would offer a deeper game play experience. Dice Forge is much lighter than I thought it would be, most of the choices you make are quite simple. All of the strategies you can explore are very straight forward, there really isn't much depth to uncover. Each turn you are either buying new die faces to add to your dice or spending resources to complete heroic feats [i](i.e. collect cards)[/i] The cards are worth end game points and may have different abilities that trigger instantly or can be activated during a specific phase. There are some cards/die faces that will effect your opponents, but nothing too nasty.  

My daughter has really enjoyed our plays, so I'll be hanging onto it for now and keep my fingers crossed that expansions come out which ramp up the complexity of the game or at least diversify the strategies you can pursue. At this point I would recommend the game for families, it's easy to learn and crafting your dice is definitely satisfying.  However; this isn't a game I'm interested in bringing out with my game group, currently the game play is too straight forward and simple. Your enjoyment of Dice Forge depends on how much enjoyment you'll get out of crafting your dice and creating a simple engine to accrue points.

[i]I would also recommend checking out [thing=150146][/thing] which, as mentioned earlier, is another dice crafting game that would be easier for younger kids [i](I'd say 7+)[/i] to play. The theme may also be more appealing to kids and I really like how the scoring/end of game work in Rattlebones.[/i][/i]

After first try: 
Interesting mechanics with modifying dice. I am a bit ambivalent about games where you chose to get momentum or points. This game also changes during the course of the game from gaining gold to buy dice upgrades to scoring points. 

It's still quite fun, but maybe a bit static, there were too little variation in the scoring cards, and the game might be too repetitive to play often.

First impression. Upgrading your sides of the dice (dice-crafting) works very well, as game-element, but also practical. It is really exciting to roll your new dice. The game itself is good, interesting options for different strategies, not a lot of interaction though (but that didn't bother me). The only big downside is the downtime: a turn can take quite long, since you can't think ahead and the changing of the sides takes some time. To summarize, great idea, good game.

Compulsive and pleasant, but not terribly engaging.

This is a new go-to. Definitely recommended.

I had been following this release for the past 8 months or so. Bought it over this past weekend, really enjoyed playing 2 player, can definitely see the strategy difference playing with 4 players. I'll try that this weekend.

As many have said in other reviews, the initial setup takes some time, but do it with someone else and enjoy that time building the dice and learning the rules. My wife and I had a lot of fun putting everything together with one another.

Gameplay is very short, we could get through a game in less than a half hour after we got the hang of it. Wish there was more to it, so we may add some additional home rules to make it more entertaining after a while.

Fun. If I had to sum up this game in one word it'd be fun. Although a light game of chucking dice at heart, there are nonetheless important decisions to be made and strategy and tactics are both important. And the production values are through the roof! From the dice whose faces you change, through the cards you collect, to the quite brilliantly designed insert which puts everything away perfectly, this game is almost a work of art product design wise. I imagine expansions will follow and I for one eagerly await them. Splendid game.

From Designer Régis Bonnessée, I had to own it. Especially when I knew it had awesome cool dice. It has been on my wishlist since before Essen last year. Nice production and very clever tray insert to hold the dice chits that you can use to upgrade your dice in game. Really fun game and the only con I can think of would be downtime as players switch out the dice face on their turns. Otherwise great engine builder and dice builder game! I look forward to trying out all of the different cards and future expansions I can foresee.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this game, on each player's turn they roll two dice. The dice produce resources or victory points depending on the face. Then the active player decides to either upgrade the faces of one of their dice (which pop on and off like legos), or they move their pawn and take a card. The cards are where most of the interesting special abilities and points come from, and you can alter the setup of the game by changing the available cards, in a sort of a dominion style way. Depending on the card you take, or the dice faces you choose to upgrade to you spend the resources you collected during all the rolls. The game timer clicks each time the start player gets a turn, and then you see who managed the most points.

The game is interesting in that depending on which die faces and which cards you take, you can follow very different paths through the game, each of which has a reasonable shot of working out if some combination of luck and planning works out for you. I sort of like the idea that if your big move doesn't work out for you, it's because you didn't buy the right die faces at the right time. That being said, I've had two games where my big final move was spoiled by virtue of being one resource short, which can be a little frustrating, as at that point what can you do? It's still ultimately a dice game, so if you stacked one die with all of one type of resource, it would be overkill, and if you stacked it with half and half, then maybe what you need doesn't come up when you need it.

Excellent production of the components. Particularly like how the card art ties into the location art of their locations. 
It plays fast - even if a bit fiddly when replacing the die faces. Has some nice strategy as the game progress from the build dice (engine) to the accumulate points (scoring) phases. Both the building the dice for money which have some scoring possibilities and going for gems and VP faces seem to be valid. 
Was easy to learn and teach, I found it to be in the same level as Splendor.
Long term some additional quest cards would be a nice expansion, but not required.

My family has taken to this game very well. Rolling your dice and gathering so many resources and points. You are always feeling successful and gaining things all of the time. I love the dice customization and excitement when you roll that new die face that was purchased. I'm not sure how I feel about the one dice face that is put on an opponents die. This game doesn't seem to be one that leads for good "take that" mentality. I also got burned by it big time which left a bad taste in my mouth. I rolled that face way more than the dice odds should have been. LOL. It's easy enough to just pick the other option for that market slot. I'm also not a fan of the rules and their layout. It is very hard to read through and understand for such a simple, but fun game. Be very careful about the player variant changes as well. Some poeple had more trouble than other in swapping out dice faces, but I thought it was done perfectly to be tight, but not too tight. Hopefully that doesn't get worn down too much over time and with more plays. Fantastic game!

I knew this was a light game going into it.  In fact, we actually like lighter family style games.  But I was a bit disappointed in this.  Just not enough meat on the bones.  

Several have commented that this is better than Rattlebones.  I highly disagree.  In Rattlebones you have a lot of different die faces and they all seem unique.  In Dice Forge the variety of die faces seems bland.  Get  gold, sun, or moon resources and convert to VP.  Some of the cards are pretty cool, but in the end you're simply converting 3 types of resources into VPs.  Also, resources are so plentiful, especially gold.  There never seems to be a struggle for anything.  That may sound good to some, but to me it takes the tension away.

Also terrible setup instructions.  I had to come to BGG to figure out setup, which is ridiculous for such an easy game.

Rattlebones is the better game hands down.

Rolling dice is fun! Very luck-based though and not much options to mitigate that. Go for it if you're looking for a quick and light game, and you don't really care who wins :)

oh, this is fun! the game can be a little random and swingy due to the nature of the dice, but that often isn't a big huge deal. in fact, the game encourages you to go for that with a x3 face and a spendable 2x chit for some player choice. buy faces or go on quests? fill up that gold card or fight the biggest monster to extinction? fill your dice with victory points or maybe horde sunstones for more options? seems to me like score range for a game isn't too terribly spread out and everyone is engaged every turn. also, the insert is fantastic! the whole thing reminds me a lot of Valeria Card Kingdoms: so much earning, building, gaining! also, quite a bit of cleanup at the end, but honestly it isn't too much to bear. admittedly, sometimes mid-game the breaks get thrown on when you have to wait for a player to replace a million faces at once, but that just emphasizes how smoothly the game has been flowing up to that point. AP isn't much of a deal since most all decisions feel rewarding, although sticking with a strategy will noticeably up your chances of success. oh, and so much potential for expansions! if you're tired of backstabbing each other, come step into the sun and try a game all about getting things all the time!

This is a deck builder, but instead of cards, you have awesome dice that launch turn into weapons when you pry out the sides to upgrade them with better ones. Great for people who like deck building games like dominion, and who enjoy aesthetically beautiful games. Not great for people whose doctors told them not to get sharp tiles of plastic in their eyeballs.

Dice Forge, in my opinion, definitely succeeds in being more than its attractive gimmick of dice modification.  There are a surprising number of interesting options, even with the recommended set of cards (though admittedly I believe that the very first strategy I tried is the optimal one, at least for that set), and there are definitely a few interesting ways to try to shape your dice to your strategy.  Obviously frustration can occur when that shiny new face you added to your die fails to show up for the next six rolls, but that possibility is inseparable from the core mechanic of the game, and I have not yet felt any significant sense of drought.  Furthermore, the game succeeds in being accessible, yet interesting, and packs itself into a very reasonable playing time.  I have sometimes wished that the game would go on for at least another few rounds, which is a good sign.

I really like the innovation of this game. Popping off dice faces to replace with better ones is very cool. Almost deckbuilder-like. The game is incredibly light, which some people are upset about, but I enjoy that about it. I get lighter games to the table more often as they play a wider audience of people. It's got enough there to be fun and the art is gorgeous. Use a bobby-pin to pop off the dice sides. Trust me.

一个可以不断升级的骰子，也许很多人都想过，但真正做出来又是另外一件事！对于游戏的配件设计可以给5分，既要满足拆装性又要满足耐久，对于一个桌游配件来说是个非常大的挑战（这个游戏的成本估计都在骰子上了）。游戏的机制非常简单，投骰—拿资源—升级投资/买功能卡，但路线设计还是有一点点意思。适合推新，适合在重度游戏前后来一局调剂。唯一的不满是说明书写的很渣。

A fun and innovative game. Love the artwork and how the gameplay incorporates the box itself into the game. It's easy to get into, strikingly beautiful and on top of that it's very, very fun and brings more depth than one would initially think. 

Still, this game isn't for you when you don't like luck-heavy games. Even when you have all the best sides on your dice, if they screw you over, you will still lose. ;)

Easy to learn/teach and the whole game looks great. The "Dark" dice aren't very dark, so it can be a bit difficult to tell them apart but it may not matter since you can look at your dice faces at any time anyway. 

The build the dice mechanic is awesome and fun, and there are some interesting choices to make. I think this is a pretty decent game to use as a gateway game. And it's got one of the best inserts. It's very easy to keep everything organized.

The cards are a bit thin and warped a bit. I considered sleeving them to keep them flat but then they won't fit in their sections of the board. It's a minor nit-pick though--the game is great fun!

The dice building mechanic is well implemented here, and this game is on about the same complexity level as the Dominion Core set or Mystic Vale core set.  It is quick to play and easy to teach.  The artwork is exceptional.  The main problem is that the dice are so big that they do not roll poorly, and in a dice game that is a significant issue.  I had to roll the dice around in my hands before tossing them on the table.

Pros
- Great component quality
- Inexpensive for what you get in the box
- Games are very quick, sometimes lasting only 25-30 mins with 2 players (great if we don't have a ton of time but still want to play something)

Cons
- Luck can sometimes make it impossible for one player to win (though it's dice, so that's expected)
- Games often seem to end 3-4 turns before you really feel like you've got your engine working
- Gets same-y quickly

This is a good game and fun most of the time I play it. The only real downside is that after about 2 games, I'm ready to put it away and move on. However, it feels somewhat fresh when we pull it out again.

This is a dice building game.  You roll dice to get resources.  Then you can spend these resources to buy cards with special abilities and victory points.  You can also spend resources to replace one of the faces on one of your dice with a new face.  The game is pretty quick and takes about 30-45 minutes.

tl;dr: not more than the sum of it's parts

I love the concept of building dice with custom faces to build your strategy. [thing=150146][/thing] did it first (I think) and was enjoyable, but I didn't feel it used the idea to it's full potential. I hoped this game would do more with the concept. It's been a while since I played Rattlebones, but I feel like this game does even less with the idea. It's just too basic. Roll the dice to gain resources, use those resources to buy new sides or get points. Was there really nothing else they could do with the concept?
Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad game, but there is just so much more untapped potential.
Oh, and the game is way overproduced and probably costs more than the gameplay warrants.

Very weird experience. It feels like it is over way too soon. The improvement faces for the dice that can really make a difference are affordable only when the game is almost over, which unfortunately makes these improvement faces much much less attractive. Which - again - makes you think what your options really ARE. Weird but not bad!

Really satisfying light game. Customizing the Dice is fun/functional (no need for additional tool).  

We played the turn structure wrong (only rolling once for each player per round and then everyone got to buy).  
The game was still fun, but felt WAY too short...looking forward to trying it again.

Had a blast the first time and wasn't ready to stop...so, the additional resources and game length should be perfect!  Here's hoping!
-------------------------------------------------------------
Played a 2nd time... using the correct rules (rolling @ the beginning of EACH Active Players turn...) MUCH better than the first game, was able to leverage the Engine we'd been building.  Quick turns...Game length felt about right @ just over 30min...  Really fun! Excellent production quality, great value and really functional insert!  Love it!

I really enjoy this light game. Its very simple to teach and understand the concepts, yet still does hold well in terms of needing some strategy. It's a great game to play with my oldest son since his attention span isn't typically the strongest. Being able to constantly have something it interact with is great for him. Also you really learn to love or hate your dice as the game progresses. Typically, if you forged them correctly, you'll love them. Solid game.

Our first 2P play we forgot to roll our dice (Divine Blessing) twice per turn and felt like it ended before we got anywhere.  Don't make that mistake!  It was substantially better once played correctly.  Not my favorite game, but an enjoyable one that isn't too difficult to learn.  I do wonder how the dice will hold up to heavy play (you can only remove/add sides so many times before something starts wearing out, I think), but otherwise the components and storage are excellent!

Gets an extra point for production value. 
Ultimately a luck-fest. Unlike deckbuilders or bag builders, where you will inevitably get to see the cards you buy; the dice faces you buy may never show up in the game as a result of the fact that each roll of the dice is a separate event. 
Dice games  just aren't my thing, unless its dice selection or has ways to mitigate the rolls. Seasons and Castles of Burgundy are good examples of dice games where you feel like you can mitigate the luck of the dice in some ways and are much better than this. 
This has very nice components though, but that can't make up for a game with luck akin to a roll and move game.
Not for me!

One of those games that makes me think: is BGG rating really useful?
I can't undertand how a game like this can be considered 363rd. Only 362 games better than Dice Force? Really?

Dice Forge isn't a bad game, absolutely. Very nice components, fast enough, simple enough. But there's so much luck, decisions aren't that interesting and the gameplay itself is quite dull.
At the end , you don't have any mean to take advantage of the resources you still have collected. Basically you spend half game or more trying to be better at collecting resources and when you are good at it, the game ends and you could end up wasting a lot. This, togheter with the enormous influence of luck, make the game quite frustrating.
Really, is this game better than Torres, than Tobago, than Carcassonne H&G, Discworld, Kingdom Builder, Through the desert? Really?
It seems people is more attracted by shiny things nowadays.
And by the way, changing the sides of the dice isn't that easy after all and you don't have a good way to remember who bought what from where.

でも、考えどころも戦略も駆け引きもあるぞ。単純に運ゲーだと思ってたり、最適解があるとか思っている人は、何処かを見落としているか気付いていないし、パッと見その辺を意識させていない設計だと思う。
もっとこういった設計方針を評価してもいいと思うんだ。

It's definitely a lighter filler game. Not really designed to the same depth as Seasons, but this is ok.

Unique mechanic that I fully expect to see integrated into many, many future games. Build your own dice. I love it. Rather simplistic, but none-the-less satisfying. Gorgeous to look at and fun to play.

Too short I found, but fun, more fun with the additional cards and not the basics.

Not really fun, nice stuff, original idea with dice but not enough control on the game. Good with kids and newbies.

I like this game. Can be frustrating at times when you don't get the sides you spent all your resources on, but overall a solid experience. I would advise to spend a few minutes selecting the cards though, as some of them are a lot more interesting than their counterparts.

Remembers us of "Rattlebones" where the "forging dice" mechanic was first introduced. I hope this will soon be played. 
Bought at "Spel 2017" in Antwerp.

I enjoyed Dice Forge a lot more than I expected I would!  Modifying your dice is a neat gimmick... but the way some of the die faces interact with other dice makes the decisions on how to build your dice more meaningful than they seem at first.  There is of course a lot of luck in a game based on this much die rolling... but you roll so much it seems to balance out more often than not... and if it doesn't the game is incredibly fast to play.  I'm not sure I need a copy in my collection, but I could see the kids liking this one quite a bit... we'll see.

Plays quickly, looks great and you get to roll your dice every single turn. The pure engine building is probably too simple to offer much replayability but at the end of the day this is a super filler so it can probably withstand many short, punchy plays.

Much better than I expected.  The dice actually work (though they're less annoying if I use a screwdriver.)

The 45min play time allows for 2 or 3 plays comfortably.

The beautiful, colorful art reminds me of Seasons, and that's a good thing.

Kellemes kis családi játék, az Évszakok csili-vili látványvilágát idéző dizájnnal. A kockatuningolás nagyon klassz és egyedi ötlet, valamint a holtidőt csökkentő mechanika is üdvözítő. Egyedül a kockadobásból származó szerencsével nem lehetünk kibékülve, de egy ilyen gyors és egyszerű játéknál szerintem ez bőven belefér.

Fun dice building game. Very simple game play but the instructions are laid out HORRIBLY. We had to watch a video to figure out what terms meant.

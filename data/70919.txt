RATING: 8.5
I enjoyed this game. It is a board building game that is easy enough for young players to play but still has enough startegy that adults will enjoy. My favorite part of the game is the Artwork, It is very well done and makes the game very enjoyable to play. There are many ways to score, Having the panda eat bamboo, Build map pieces and growing Bamboo. This would be a fun family game for a large age range.

RATING: 5
Visually attractive, deceptively simple.
Lots of options on each turn... which sometimes don't matter in the end. If you make no mistakes the game is quite heavily decided by the luck of the draw. 
Your hand can too easily be full of quests that are impossible to finish in time.

Cute, starts as a surprisingly cutthroat little game, ends as an elaborate coinflip.

Great production, but the mechanics didn't appeal - not very interesting. Particularly frustrating is the 'unintentional screw'. Messing up someone else's plans in pursuing your own is all well and good but in this game it's often completely accidental and therefore unsatisfying to both sides. 

Possibly a great family game, but for me personally it's a low scorer.

Very nice game. Despite being simple and having an element of chance, it feels like you are playing and not the game. There's choices in this, and strategy, and just enough chance for making it fun to play with kids or newbies or whatever. Probably my favourite family game to date. The components (got the ordinary edition) are GREAT too!

RATING: 6
Light silly game about gardening and eating with nice components and a small touch of strategy.

On a given turn, you roll the dice (this is not as bad as it sounds), which determines the "weather" which is to say it gives a special effect for that player- all the effects are good, such as an extra action, being able to duplicate an action etc., but they are not all necessarily balanced, and worse, they can be very situational (and not come up in the situation when you need them and vice versa).  On your turn, you typically have 2 actions, and they range from laying a tile (which expands the garden, and which is useful for potential scoring cards), move the gardener (which grows bamboo also useful for scoring cards), move the panda (who eats the bambo, useful for scoring cards), take a scoring card, and irrigate a tile (this action works similar to Santiago although it is a very weak action in this game).

The game ends when a player has completed a set number of scoring cards.  All points are gained through the scoring cards, with a small bonus for the first player to finish.

The game looks super light and fluffy, and to an extent it is, but it's still a good design with a bit of game in it, and the components/theme will be a definite plus for some people.

Own the [boardgame=174095]Chibis[/boardgame] expansion.

Takenoko is a game by designer Antoine Bauza (a well-known designer who has also produced hits like Tokaido, 7 Wonders, and Hanabi. He has a thing for Japan, it seems). Takenoko packages fun, gorgeous artwork with a competitive tile-laying game. Much like Tokaido, this game is competitize in a lighter, more zen sense than other, more cutthroat games.

Together, players are moving the various tokens around (panda and gardener) to eat and plant bamboo shoots, that are grown on irrigated tiles that are also laid by the players. All players are competing for secret objectives that earn points. Everyone's objectives are different, so players will find themselves competing to get the panda and the tiles in the right positioning to achieve their own goals.

A fun little game that's light on rules and light on strategy; a nice (though frustrating for me) balance that will appeal to many people.

A good game, but a clear strategy comes out as stronger than the others. The fact that you could get points for drawing a card from the Plot Objective card deck that you can't usually get from the other two decks. Other than that, the game is fun and an interesting use of components.

It is a game you can look at and love, play with anyone, and relax your way through. There is little stress; it's all rather silly; and if you don't look for too much strategy, it puts a great big smile on your face. And it has enough Euro-mechanics involved to keep gamers happy too.

I'd like it more if it wasn't so harshly confusing to a color-blind person! The yellow and green goals are really similar to me. And the tiles! Garish in colors to begin with, but why couldn't they stick to some clear graphic design to separate pink and green appropriately. And again - they yellow is awful! Mechanically, it's a high luck affair - but cute and approachable. If it was just colorblind friendly!

Obviously this has a good theme - they ought to sell it at Edinburgh zoo now that they have the pandas as it may sell by the bucketload.  It's visually very interesting. Some of the play is a wee bit reminiscent of a stripped down Santiago.  It's not as clean and deep as that one by a long chalk, but it is a decent game.  The cards and tiles offer lots of luck.- you can draw pink bamboo on cards bu not on tiles for instance, which hampers you massively, but then I'm not one of those measly party-popping gamers who insists that every game needs to have minimum luck.  It's nice to have a bit of variety.

The more advanced rules would be beyond a lot of kids under ten on the first play as the game is a lot meatier than it's theme suggests or than you would expect in a "kids' game."  I think it's more of a family game really.

As a game I'd give it a 5, but since it's got a great theme is good, light fun and has wonderful bits I think a 6 is more reasonable.

Very nice artwork and fairly enjoyable, but after playing it a few times I find I often suggest other games over this one. It's pretty simple, once you figure out the rules about weather and irrigation. My kids (ages 7 to 13) like to play it more than I do. I tried it with my parents while they were visiting us, thinking they would like the artwork and not-too-complicated game-play, but they didn't care for it and seemed excited only when the game ended. They're quite tough to please, though.

light, fun and gorgeous. After one game their is a lot to discover, so far I find hilarious the weather dice, the lighting in particular, which scares the panda to a tile of your choice, where it has to eat one piece of bamboo in order to regain his wits. I want to play more before I rate it!

Unique modular board game with a colorful, happy theme. I've played 2p and 4p, and both games were interesting and entertaining. Great for families with younger kids (7+).

The components are wonderful, the mechanics make sense, and the player mats really aid in the fluidity of the game. With several paths to victory, you never feel like one strategy trumps all the others, and being able to play off of other player's decisions makes the game dynamic and unpredictable.

I really enjoy Takenoko, and I hope I get to play it more.

Takenoko should have a better rating but my wife will not allow it. 

This game is easy to learn, there is strategy, it's quick essentially it has everything that makes a game good. It has even been built nice. The art is nice and the pieces are nice. It's just a very nice game to look at and interact with. 

My wife however does not like it. and my color blind friend can't play it so it gets a 6.

RATING: 7
A cool game.  Limited action selection with personal card-based goals (objectives).  And it has a panda.  Which is cool.  Really this is an abstract with a nice, friendly, cute theme pasted on.  But it works very well so it doesn't quite feel like an abstract and doesn't hit that oh-boy-this-is-dry point that most abstracts do.

Why not a higher score then?  Because the goal cards drive EVERYTHING.  You can draw into a HORRIBLE combination and be behind for the rest of the game.  Like I did.  And there's very little you can do to repair this if other players are able to capitalize on their goals.  Which they will.  Because they can.  And you can't.  And you must spend actions drawing MORE goal cards to fix the problem.

Oddly enough this is solved fairly easily (I suspect).  Draw 2, keep 1 for opening goal draws?  Draw 2, keep 1 for whole game?  Have a visible goal offer?

But it still leaves the problem of drawing into the perfect goal.  Mid-to-late game, your draw may yield a goal that is 1-action away while my draw yields an impossible goal (or one that would take far too much time or luck to accomplish).  There's something slightly wacky where good goal draws can overshadow someone else's superior play.  And that irks me.

Even so, the theme prevails and I would play this game at least until it annoys me enough to lower the rating and cry foul.

FAVOURITE GAME - it is a stunningly beautiful entry level boardgame, where you control a gardener growing bamboo and a panda eating the bamboo. You have secret objectives cards which you have to fulfill to gain points (growing bamboo, eating bamboo, building a garden). The objectives are a bit unbalanced, as it is harder to grow bamboo than eating it, but the same points go for each, but still, it is a fun game, with easy rules and stunning visuals.

If this game had better colorblind friendlyness I would MAYBE give this a 9.  Very fun game, I think one of the optional rules in the expansion rules should be a rule in the main game.  We houserule this in.  Just give an extra victory point for every set of three types of victory cards you have.  This promotes diversity, and alleviates a concern I have that the gardener cards are a bit too strong and swingy if you pull one that is almost complete or already done.

My only real complaint about Takenoko is that there is much room for strategic thought. That is a problem because there is sooooo much luck in this game that all strategy ultimately becomes pointless!

I will always have a place in my heart for Takenoko. It is one of my wife's favorites, and I enjoy it. That being said, we played Takenoko immediately after playing Karuba during game night and I couldn't get over the slowish turns. We did have 2 players new to the game, but the downtime was too long for the amount of game here. That being said, I still enjoy the game enough to want to play it occasionally.

This is a cute, light family game featuring an adorable panda and frustrated gardener.  Parents with younger kids will like this, because it's not as mind-numbing as many other family games.  It also has high production quality and is quite nice to look at while playing.  However, used as an adult game I found it lost its lustre after only a few plays.  There's not enough depth here to keep the game fresh.

I don't think this one has enough legs to warrant a purchase, but the components are very nice and it's a fun little game that doesn't overstay its welcome. In my one play I recognized the obvious power of drawing the tile VP cards and I can't really see that strategy getting beat unless all the other players worked together to stop it.

This game is so much fun. Sometimes I win, other times I lose. I had a hard time understanding the rule book (I don't know why) but YOUTUBE helped me out. Lot of fun and one my wife and I enjoy.

An unusual and cute theme - a pet panda chomping its way through the Japanese Emperor's bamboo patch.  The production is quite endearing too, with panda and gardener figures and nicely done bamboo segments.

I wish the game we are given to play with this nice stuff were better.  Takenoko offers three ways to score; by collecting sets of eaten bamboo, by growing bamboo in specific locations, and by achieving various patterns of land tiles. Scoring cards are drawn in the manner of tickets in Ticket to Ride.  What you quickly learn is that eating sets of bamboo is the easiest thing to do in the early game.  In the late game, drawing land tile scoring cards can get you instant points for a pattern that already exists.  Whether you get easy points or something impossible to complete is all down to the luck of the draw.  Add the luck of a weather die roll, which randomly gives you an always useful extra action or some other effect that may be of no use.  Add the chaos of other players unwittingly contributing to or hindering completion of your secret objectives.

I found Takenoko quite painless and even a bit of fun to play. However, I don't think it is a very good game.

A little gem of a game that's lighthearted and super easy to pick up and play.
The idea of the game is to accumulate points by completing objectives. The objectives are in 3 categories; Bamboo growth, Panda bamboo consumption, and land hex arrangement.
Land hexes and bamboo shoots are in 3 colours; pink, yellow and green. 
Completing bamboo growth cards involves using a combination of rain and the farmer to make bamboo of particular colours to grow to certain heights. Completing panda bamboo consumption cards means moving the panda to where bamboo is growing and eating the shoots (See how these 2 types work for and against each other). Finally the land placement objectives are met by placing land hexes of particular colours into given arrangements in the play area.

The artwork is lovely and playful and the pieces are very well made. I would recommend this as a way to get kids involved in games or for involving girlfriends that aren't really into heavy duty strategy games.

Maybe influenced by the prettiness, but I think this is one of the best games of its weight. Similar difficulty to Catan, maybe even easier, but just a joy to play.

Sometimes, though, it feels like nothing is actually getting done by choice, just greedy planning with a little chance. It's still satisfying, but kind of empty fun? So I dropped it a little. Maybe it will pop back up.

The players take the role of courtesans of the Nippon emperor. They take care of his Giant Panda by growing a bamboo plantation. Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow. In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card.

A gateway game, with a cute theme, but it doesn't quite cohere for me as a fun gaming experience.  The theme is right there, well applied to the abstractions going on on the board, but the goals seem, how shall I put it?  Thematically arbitrary.  And so they drive the game, and attract almost all your attention, yet, don't feel that special. Nevertheless, an interesting design.

Gran juego familiar, tiene los toques de azar y control indicados para gran diversión, no es un juego muy profundo, porque no es su objetivo.

Sin duda el mejor juego de menos de 1 hora que he jugado.

Logra ser inmersivo por su temática y la calidad excepcional de sus componentes, son una maravilla.

Funciona perfecto a 2 jugadores, un gran logro, realmente recomendado para comenzar ludoteca, más entretención a mi modo de ver que catan.

Nota: Los objetivos de parcelas dan pocos puntos, sin ser fácil realizarlos. Por lo que se recomienda agregar lo siguiente: Por cada set de 3 objetivos distintos cumplidos, se dan 3 puntos de victoria adicionales (set: objetivo de panda, granjero y parcela). Esto da incentivo a utilizar los objetivos de parcelas.

The game is fairly simple and easy to understand. The theme ties fairly good with the gameplay and makes Takenoko a great game for non-gamers and casual gamers.

For players who would like a bit more depth in strategy in their games, Takenoko doesn't have much to offer, but it's still fun to play, especially considering the duration is below one hour. Insta-score objectives might bother people, but then again, luck factor is highly efficient in this game.

The directions for the game in the 1st edition are incorrect and ambiguous. The revised version of the rules, v1.5 helps straighten everything out but there are still some ambiguities. 

For a two player game, the game is not really that great. It is also not what I expected, I expected it to be a medium-light game; however, for 2-players, the game is more like a light-light game. Since the game has so many components, I wanted it to be heavier. 

I believe it will play completely different with more players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yeah, it may have some balance issues (in terms of card points distribution) and a slightly irregularly shaped box, but Takenoko excels at so many levels for a filler/ gateway game title.  It comes packed with some gorgeous components, has rules that can be taught as you play and does indeed only take around 45 minutes to finish.  Overall a lot of fun and a unique blend of engaging mechanics.

Really enjoyed playing Takenoko with 3 players.  Art and components are beautiful.  Cool game mechanics that I can't really compare to anything else.  The one thing that I'm not sure how I feel about is the amount of secret information that it encourages.  Since you don't have to lay down your objectives immediately, you can only guess as to how close anyone else is to ending the game.

A beautiful little game. Perfect as a gateway game with its simple  and quick to learn mechanics and short play time (around 45 mins).

Highly recommend, I think this will be a regular to the table.

Takenoko could have possibly been Antoine Bouza's best game (which is saying something) but it feels rushed to production and in need of more playtesting.

This game will either be a hit or a miss with a game group.  It's not really clear why, but I suspect it relates to the group dynamic and the player's ability to work with shared components.  In this game, the farmer and the panda are both shared elements in the game.  (For that matter, the board tiles and the bamboo are as well!)  And a player needs all of these to align in the right way to score points based on hidden objective cards.  If the other players 'don't cooperate' with your plans, you might not do so well.  But if you are flexible and adjust to the situation well, this game can be a great deal of light fun.  It will not be a brain-burner.  But it is not merely light fluff.  Observing and responding to the board's development is key.  If you miss this, it can feel chaotic.  If you get it, it will feel tactical.  Excellent components, visually appealing, and approachable (to some crowds) combine to make it a fine family game.

An interesting but light game, with some interesting mechanisms, like the push and pull of farmer trying to grow the bamboo shots and the panda trying to eat them.

It's definitely a family game, with weather die randomly giving a player a bonus that lift some of the game's restrictions (i.e. one side allows a player to take three actions, not two; or take two of the same action) that makes it easier to do stuff. It can also be a bit lucky with objective cards, I feel like I jump from third to almost first with some lucky card draws on the last turn.

Számomra ez abszolút Ticket to ride jellegű és szintű játék, ezért pontszámban is ugyanannyit adok rá. Talán a TTR letisztultabb, de ez meg egyedibb témájú, végre nem egy újabb vonatos célkártyás játék.
Ritkán mondok ilyet, de ez egy aranyos játék, sokkal inkább érzem családinak a bambuszt rágcsáló pandát, mint a vonatokat (nem is értem egyébként ezt a nagy vonatbuzulást a társasjátékok világában, azt elismerem, hogy vannak jó vonatos játékok, de magát a tényt nem értem, miért jelenik meg ennyi vonatos játék.) 
De visszatérve a pandákra: a nagy gondom a játékkal, hogy óriási szerencsefaktort jelentenek a célkártyák, mert egész könnyű kártyákat is lehet húzni, és nagyon nehezeket is, és a kártyák pontszáma szerintem nem mindig tükrözi a nehézségi szintet.
Egyébként a célkártyák többsége nagyon gyorsan teljesíthető, a pálya folyamatosan változik, ezért szigorúan taktikai játék, ritkák a körökön átívelő célok. Bár az lehet stratégiai döntés, hogy milyen típusú kártyákra megy rá valaki (külön vannak válogatva típusok szerint), ennek szabályozására különböző variánsok születtek, mi is egy ilyet próbáltunk (nem lehet a kézben 2 azonos típusú célkártya, ha nincs mindháromból legalább 1).
Összességében kellemes játék, nem korszakos, de néha szívesen játszom vele.

Igényes, szemeknek tetszetős komponenseket tartalmazó játék - teljesen átlagos játékmenettel.
Kártyák által meghatározott feladatokat kell teljesítenünk trágyázó kertész, és bambuszrügyeket zabáló pandamackó irányításával. Inkább szórakoztató, sem mint agytekervényeket megmozgató játék. 
A társasjátékokkal most ismerkedők társaságában is bátran elő vehető. 
Túl nagy késztetést nem érzek ismét játszani vele...

A little jewel in my opinion... 
Great material (beautiful), easy for beginners, with a bit of strategy and good to play in 2.

Takenoko has gorgeous components, and is an early candidate for the 2012 Spiel des Jahres.
Its target audience is families and casual gamers (there's various factors of luck), so I am not in the ideal position to love the game, but I don't despise it either: for the gamers crowd Takenoko is a perfectly fine light game, very enjoyable if you don't take competition too seriously!

A game where the components really make the game.  It is simply beautiful.  I find it very relaxing, and it works well with all the player counts.  The only complaint I really have with it is how inconsistent some of the points are on the objective cards.  You can get triple the points without much more effort at times on some of the cards.  But even with that, it often is very close in the end, and the game is just really enjoyable.  Turn on some Japanese folk music, get some tea, and let yourself get into the mood of the game.  It really is delightful!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First off, this game is beautiful.
The whole concept of growing this communal garden is fantastic, and there is something really zen about the whole process.

As much as I enjoy the concept and general game play. I often find I am craving some deeper strategy elements to this game. Maybe after a group has played it enough to know all the cards, and understand every option, it would be possible to play deeper. But for the moment, I find I don't have the capability to block my opponents, or even read them well enough to know what they are planning. As so many goal cards require all 3 elements to be utilised.

This game is still fun, and doesn't take an absurd amount of time. Just has the slight feeling of just going through the motions around the middle of the game.

Would recommend as a lighter/introductory game to newer table top players.

The game itself is beautiful, but the gameplay is just too light for me to enjoy. There are very few in-game choices to be made, and those choices are almost inconsequential. If it has value, it's as an introductory game for a very young audience. I found that the expansion helped add a little bit of complexity to the game, but not enough to redeem it.

UPDATE: Since my first attempt at this game I have not only finished playthroughs with me kids, but I also got to play a full 3 player game with grown ups. Excellent game. No I am kinda sad that the only copy in my house belongs to my now 11 year old daughter.

OLD: Haven't actually finished a full game of this, but I will say that what I did experience leads me to believe the hype about this one. It is a fun and thematic game. I gave this to my youngest daughter for Christmas. She was too tired to finish the first time we pulled it out. I really like the hidden goals mechanic in games. It forces you to try not to be too obvious about what you are trying to do. Also, all the components have a high level of cuteness.

I admit, I bought the game because of the gorgeous artwork, painted panda mini and stacking bamboo pieces. Gameplay was slightly flat to me initially cause the strategy not as deep as expected. It was alright, light strategy but my expectations were sky-high. 


I was even contemplating to sell it, but resisted cause PANDA MINI! Luckily I didn't and give it another try with my non-gamer friends, and they love it and had way more fun than I expected. Keeping this to pull out from time to time when playing with non-gamer friends. The game is so much better after I played with two different variants as well.

The rating is for the Collector's Edition.

This is a wholesome light medium weight family game with a bit of randomness in regards to cards drawn and the outcome of the die. Still, it does hold your attention as a quick fun game and for the production values; especially the nicely done figures, the oversized die and tiles and the ton of wood that is bamboo. It also comes in a beautiful custom made box with foam inserts for the pieces.

There is a game in there for new gamers or family nights, but experienced gamers will probably bore quickly. Don't get me wrong, there are some decisions to be made and a layer of depth that appeared after a few plays, but the game felt that it would be scripted and repetetive after a few plays... In the few plays that I had, it seemed that some of the card objectives were a bit easier to accomplish than others, but I need to reasses to confirm. 

This will probably have a higher appeal to father/daughters, girlfriends/wives or smaller kids for the theme, cuteness factor and beautiful bits/colors. On the other spectrum, it will probably be highly sought after by collectors if the print run is limited.

I can’t believe it, I’ve found an eurogame I actually like! And as though this weren’t surprising enough, I have to add I can’t even stand either Seven Wonders, the previous hit by the same author, and any Far Eastern theme!

There’s something charming in Takenoko indeed I still can’t point out even though I’ve played it quite a few times: I surely like the extreme simplicity and clarity of its rules but I also enjoy how everything plays smoothly and at the same time gives the game its strong thematic flavor.

On the other hand, it’s a pity the interaction among the players is minimal or nonexistent: nonetheless the game does neither suffer from the lacking of direct conflict (there’s enough to do to keep you busy) nor feel like a «multiplayer solitaire» like most euros do. (October 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - A year has passed since my first plays and I still can’t get Takenoko off my mind: it’s such a fun game!

Not only do I play it gladly every time the chance occurs but I also suggest it to any undecided gamer who asks for advice, insomuch that I’ve put it in my personal list of the best gateway games for everyone, as it’s both easy to grasp and play without being either shallow or childish though.

Undoubtedly, Takenoko’s strong point (and what won me over) is you don’t have to pointlessly grind points all over the game as in your typical euro but on the contrary your efforts are directed towards specific short-term goals shown on the cards you draw, for which reason in November 2013 I raised my rating from 8 to 9.

I enjoyed this game. The scoring brought up concerns in our one play. It seemed the Panda Objectives were easier to achieve than the other objectives and their points weren't proportionately less. This was after one play, so maybe it was just the ways it played out (granted my kids who were eating all the bamboo didn't win). The second was my wife won primarily because she had a number of Tile Objectives that overlapped. I'd certainly give this another chance.

Totally uninspiring design, I've played this by accident, and since my predisposition was good Takenoko felt horrible. I didn't like it at all even I won the game. I ask myself, how can this flat game live in the top400 of BGG while there are some games that I enjoy a lot below top1500? 

Strangely both 7 Wonders and Takenoko from Antoine Bauza are two games that are brutally overrated... I love Hanabi though.

Played a giant playtest copy at Essen, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Would have bought a copy if stock had made it to the fair. For starters, it looks fantastic - the tiles and cards are beautiful, the bamboo pieces are tactile and the figures are spot-on. The game plays very nicely, with a mix of actions required to advance. You play against objective cards, but you have some control over what sort of objectives they will be. The game we played was very tight and victory came down to the wire. Very nice!

This game cracks me up!  I love eating the bamboo with the Panda.  This is another my wife enjoys playing.  I thought the pieces were well done.  The little panda and gardener are well painted and have great detail.  It has actually gotten compliments on the content organizer that is in the box.  I gave it an 8 as it is not one I will bring out a lot in my normal gaming group.  This is great for people who aren't into a lot of board games.

RATING: 5.5
Takenoko is a light and breezy game in which you get random objectives and then take 2 actions per turn of 5 available to complete them.  There is very little other players can do to stop or even slow you from completing objectives, so it turns into a race of who can complete their objectives fastest.  If this resulted in an efficiency contest, it would be a fine game.  But it doesn't.

The issue is that the bamboo comes in 3 colors, and there are different numbers of tiles for each color.  Green is most common, followed by Yellow, and Pink is rarest.   The points available for each objective scale with the rarity of the color, so having a Pink shoot 4 sections tall is worth much more than a Green one.  BUT - when placing tiles, players draw 3 and pick 1 to place.  Which, in practice, means that Pink tiles are almost as easy to come by as yellow and green.  The game would significantly benefit if the points were dependent on how rare the _Objective_ was, rather than how rare the tile was.  If there were fewer pink objectives, then fewer players would be incentivized to play pink, and then the higher point weighting would make sense.  As it is, if you draw pink objectives (and the color required to complete any given objective is random), then you will score more points and win, because the pink objectives will usually take you the same amount of actions to score them as yellow and green objectives.  

For this reason, I consider Takenoko to be a very sophisticated version of Candyland - most of the game is decided by what cards you draw.  It is a pleasant enough way to spend 30-45 minutes, and seems very suitable for kids.  But it is not a competitive activity, nor will it require you to think overmuch.

Sold.  I will only play again with kids, and only if they beg a little.

En este juego hay un oso panda que come bambú, un jardinero que se ocupa de que el bambú crezca y varios jugadores que tienen que escoger acciones en su turno (añadir losetas, coger regadíos, mover al jardinero, al panda para comer u obtener un objetivo). La partida finaliza cuando algún jugador alcanda el último objetivo (de 7 a 9 según el número de jugadores). El resto todavía tiene un turno para jugar y gana el que más puntos consigue con sus cartas de objetivos. Es sencillo, pero resultón.

This game is near and dear to my heart. Fun, strategic paper-rock-scissor dynamic. You can go for tile-playing, which can score lots of small, easy points. Or you can opt for bamboo-eating, granting more points than tile-playing, or go for growing bamboo for the difficult big points!
Also this game has a push-pull dynamic where the players play off of other players` action`s. You playing more tiles, growing bamboo, or moving panda can open up more opportunities for your opponents.
What also works for this game is the very cute and flavorful aesthetic.

An interesting idea (I love the idea of the bonus die that allows you to take a further action.)

I loathe that the parts are prone to falling over at the slightest provocation, but what's worse is the reliance on inconspicuous iconography on the "prize" cards. More than once I plotted my strategy based on something that I couldn't do because the prize card prohibited it.

This gets a lot of plays in our family. We have a 7 yr old so a lot of the games we play and how much we may enjoy them are affected by having younger players.
We ended up getting the Collectors Edition as it just looked so awesome.  This has encouraged our 4 yr old to get involved as the pieces are big enough for her to easily manipulate without knocking things over all the time. She obviously just plays with an adult but the 7 yr old plays by herself.  She can easily play and enjoy this game but doesn't quite get the strategy of witholding VPs towards the end of the game to amass more points.

Nice, if slightly boring game with a unique and adorable theme, playable by and teachable to just about anyone. With a little effort we even got my 70-year-old mom to play this, which was amazing (though why she kept thinking the gardener ate the bamboo I will never understand). 

As others have said, the Panda objective cards seem a little unbalanced, in that they are much easier to fulfill and give slightly higher rewards than they probably should (due to this our board usually had little to no bamboo left on it). We may try someone's suggestion of making the "?" icon on the die a free gardener action, to encourage more people to go for the gardener cards.

UPDATE: This game is a little too light for me, even with the Chibis expansion. There's no tension and decisions are not very interesting.

RATING: 6
A cutely produced game of trying to grow bamboo in various configurations and then eating it with a panda to score points.  A silly theme, but it really makes the game!

Basically, you have a hand of goal cards which score you points.  Some will want you to make the game board tiles configure in a certain way.  Others will want specific bamboos growing on the board.  And others will want your panda to eat certain types of bamboo.  On your turn, you get a few actions in order make all of these things match your goal cards.

Once someone fulfills 8 goals, whoever has the most points worth of goals fulfilled wins!

Honestly, the game itself is probably a 5 for me, but the production quality of this game really bumps it up a notch.

Nice family game in which players must complete objectives by placing garden plots, growing bamboo, or having the panda eating specific bamboo sections. The game has a cute theme that is perfect for families and the gameplay is very simple so that kids and adults can enjoy the game together. The artwork is colorful and I love the weather which makes each turn a little bit different. My biggest complaint is that the strategies seem a bit unbalanced with the panda objectives being better than the plot or gardener ones. Casual gamers aren't likely to mind as much but heavier gamers may be turned off by it.

Decent little family game with excellent art and a bit of depth.  The hidden scoring cards are neat, but can be a little clunky in that you can auto score some immediately upon drawing.  We play with the re-draw variant so you can't auto-score, but this makes for some odd happenings and rulings as well.  It doesn't quite feel right either way.

As my collection grows, I find myself trying harder to find those "diamonds in the rough", the good / great games (i.e. those I would rate "8" or above) that are ranked outside the Top 500.  This game is one of them.  When I first saw it in the store, I thought it was based on an anime and I was immediately prejudiced against it.  However, Bauza's name caught my eye and after watching the Cat & Mouse video on the game, I was intrigued.  The theme is quirky and cute (and certainly helped to get the girlfriend to play!).  More importantly, the tight integration of tile placement, set collection, and hidden objectives under the hood of a simple action point system makes for a fluid and engaging game from beginning to end - it also plays in less than an hour.  A top-notch, light-to-medium-weight game!

This is a great intro game, and even has enough to be a thinky middle weight game.

It's cute, it's fun, it's original! At first I thought of it as "just" another fun game, but I keep coming back to it - it has long-time staying power. I always play with the Chibis expansion, just because I happen to have it, but I think the base game alone is great too.

RATING: 2
The production is impressive. This is a pretty game. The gameplay: not so much. The cards are totally out of balance. Cards that vary wildly in completion difficulty score similar points. And the endgame is plagued by the luck of drawing cards where the conditions have already been met, or require 1 simple action. Also the luck of having other people either complete or contribute to your missions is overwhelming. A terrible design.

RATING: 6
Very nice and cute game. We always play with the 9 goals variant, where each player has to fulfill the requirements of 2 cards of each type and can only discard a series of 3 different goals at once (with a hand card limit of 5 cards). On a card draw, if a goal is already fulfilled, the card is redrawn.

This makes the game less random and a bit more tactical (we only play 2 player).

I was surprised that I actually liked Takenoko as much as I did as it’s a very light game. And I doubt I would play it more than 5 times, but still, it was an enjoyable experience. Granted, I’ve only played it with 2 players, which I’m pretty sure is the most strategic player number; at least that was what I saw in my game in which I could plan quite a bit as I knew only one other played could change the situation on the board before it’s my turn again (but that can be said about most games). I would guess it’s a little more loose with 3 while 4 is probably too chaotic and hard to plan ahead.

There is a sizable amount of luck in Takenoko – it is a light family game after all. For instance, you roll a dice at the beginning of your turn, and it’s so much better to roll the ? and the extra action (almost always)… And then there are the random terrain tile draws and especially the card draws. 
The latter did actually decide my last game; I used my last action to draw a terrain objective card which I couldn’t solve. My opponent also used his last turn to draw a terrain card; a card which we could obviously both solve, but he did and got 3 points for that... I ended the game, but that meant that my opponent got an extra turn (compared to me) in which he luckily drew that card and ended up winning by 1 point! That rubbed me the wrong way. But hey, it’s not a ”gamer’s game”, it’s a light family game which has a cute theme, good components and is visually appealing, and I would definitely recommend people with kids picking it up! Also, I always love game which feature “secret objectives” so you plan your actions around some missions which only you can accomplish.

RATING: 5
Had high hopes for this one, but this game is pure randomness - and very unbalanced randomness on top. Beginning with the die, which is by nature completely random and has possible outcomes of very different usefullness. The tile draw is of course random (but you have some choice here), the cards are random and very unbalanced - panda cards are easiest by far.
At least it plays fast - and it looks great, of course.

Great gateway game; the game we played that got my girlfriend to start playing board games. I particularly enjoyed that strategy takes more precedence over luck (as compared with most gateway games). Sure, it's luck as to what you get from the cards, but it takes strong strategy to win and is a great game to get people interested in strategy over luck boardgames

If only I had the money for the collectors edition.

Great game with lovely components and a charming theme. In my experience, however, the winner is usually determined by whoever gets the best mission cards, adding a luck factor despite not depending on dice or excessively on drawing cards. Nevertheless, completing your goals is still fun and takes strategy and timing.

Pleasant with my daughter (9). We play with the "advanced" rule that if you pick up an objective card and it has already been fulfilled, you discard it and take another. Obviously, you can still benefit by picking up objective cards that are almost fulfilled, so I wouldn't want to play this game when I was feeling especially luck-averse or competitive. Update: the objective cards issue just made the game not that enjoyable for us. Daughter sold.

A great game that is fun for casual gamers - who all seem to want to play a game with a cute panda - and also for more hard core gamers who might not admit it, but also want to play a game with a cute panda.  The three different ways to score points which can work in synergy or at cross purposes at different times allows for strategy.  

However, after a dozen play through it feels like there can be some pretty lucky swings and it wouldn't hold my interest as an every-game-night kind of game.

I picked up Takenoko because I was hoping to find a good board game to play with my girlfriend, who's not much of a gamer. After a few plays, I found that the theme was charming, the pieces were beautiful and high-quality, and the gameplay was actually quite engaging.

What I like most about Takenoko though is that I can bring it out to play with almost any group. It's a great casual game that I can play with family members, friends, gamers, and yes, my girlfriend. :) The level of depth in the game and the different paths to score points mean that experienced gamers can have a good time, and casual players or those new to the hobby won't feel overwhelmed by dozens of minute rules. The gameplay is intuitive and fun: Get cards, expand the garden, grow bamboo, eat bamboo.

A lot of people have brought up the complaint that the victory point cards are too random and don't require any skill to fulfill, and I'll admit that this is kind of true. There's an "advanced" rule that you can use that requires you to discard and redraw VP cards if they've already been fulfilled on the board, and this does make it less random. But if you're coming to Takenoko for deep strategy and no luck, you're expecting the wrong thing. The game's level of randomness feels just right for the light theme.

Overall, a great game for mixed groups of players or new/casual players, with awesome pieces and a wonderful theme. I would highly recommend Takenoko for anyone looking for a light, carefree game or a game they can pick up and play with almost anyone.

RATING: 6
The rules a bit clunkier than is necessary.  It feels to me that for a game this simple, there are just enough (probably originating in game balance) single rules that make it just a little too much for an introductory game.  But for more experienced gamers there is not much here.  The red objective cards are so much more valuable than the other objective cards, but not proportionately more difficult.  In fact, I find them easier than most blue objective cards (primarily because all tiles used must be irrigated -- this is an example of a clunky rule).

It's fun for a bit, but the replay value diminishes more quickly than other comparable games.

[b]After reading through the rules[/b] Takenoko is a conceptually very simple game in which players try to complete various simple topological and set objectives set against a bamboo garden, but are restrained by items which can be used by everyone. These items include irrigation channels (which allow bamboo to be watered), a gardener (who grows the bamboo), and a roaming panda (which eats the bamboo). Because the game uses such a mechanism, [i]and[/i] relies on a die to insert some extra randomness in what players can do every round, I expect this game to be very take that-y and tactical. And that's a shame, because I remember liking the idea of a panda roaming a bamboo garden when it was first presented for Spiel 2010 (yes, 'ten', not 'eleven'). I'm putting the game on my reserve game list for Spiel 2011: might be fun to try when there is still time left.

[b]After playing[/b] There is some strategy in how you plan your assignments, because as the garden fills up the gardening assignments become easier to fulfill. At the same time that means that someone else might already be close to finishing the game with nothing done but simple assignments. You can definitely decide how you want to play the game, that's a good thing. But with more players it's really too much about unintentional coincidences to be interesting. Too bad, the backstory is nice. That said, the game is good family material, though.

Pięknie wykonana, urocza gra o bajkowej tematyce, świetnie będą się przy niej bawić szczególnie rodzice z dziećmi, bo gra bardzo przyciąga i można się w niej zakochać od pierwszego wejrzenia, ale nie tylko wygląd gry jest tutaj na plus - mechanika również. Docelowo gra jest do 4 graczy, ale bez problemu można również zagrać w 5 osób. Wbrew ilustracjom i uroczej pandzie, gra jest dosyć wymagająca nawet dla dorosłych graczy. Karty terenu są chyba najtrudniejsze, ale też wyżej punktowane, najłatwiej zaspokoić potrzeby pandy.

A few plays now with the kids - they just love it. "Wow its so nice to play a game where you don't have to ship resources around!"

The production is first rate and the theme just blows you away. "Dad, can I send an email to the artist so I can tell them what a good job they did?"

There's absolutely some luck-of-the-draw at the end if you're not careful and are hoping for the perfect card. I'm assuming with precision play you'll know which decks are best to draw from as the game nears the end.

I play the advanced rule for the adults - if you draw an objective that's already completed, you have to discard it and draw another one.

Great game!!

I really like this game a lot! There are aspects of the theme and the mechanics that don't quite mesh and I think it's best to conceptualize it as a themed abstract game. There's also a good deal more interaction than I've seen a lot of reviews acknowledge. I like how a person in the lead can easily lose and how someone in last place can come from behind to win it with a few well timed high value objective cards. This is one I play a good deal on boardgamearena but it's something I'd love to have in my collection. The components are absolutely gorgeous!

You cannot not love the panda.  This game really is pretty to play.  Once there are bamboo shoots growing everywhere, it is quite a sight to behold.  It's extravigant, but one day I'd love to play the Collector's edition of Takenoko, it's HUGE!!!

You score by completing objective cards depending upon: what the panda eats, growing certain requirement with the gardener, or completing (with attached water) colored areas of bamboo.  First one the complete ____ points wins.

This game takes an odd theme and runs with it in a great way. The narrative ties the game's concepts together well, and the strategy is surprisingly well-layered given that you have so many choices to make. Truly inspired game and it's a blast to play.

It's nice to run into a game where the play lives up to the visual impact.  When you first look at Takenoko, it's hard not to be charmed by the hungry panda, the harried gardener, and those pastel bamboo pieces.

Luckily the gameplay is just as enjoyable.  Players take two actions (generally they must be different) which involve growing bamboo, moving around the pieces, or laying new tiles.  Eventually you try to complete objective cards that come in three types.  Once someone hits the magic number, the player with the most points on those cards wins.

It's quite simple, yet requires enough thinking to be a satisfying time for most gamers.  There's a bit of a puzzle element layered with some planning which should scratch the right itch.  And it's so CUTE.

It looks pretty. Game play did not felt balanced (if you draw impossible cards to finish, you might just sit around for the some time until you do meaningful action). Players do not plan much ahead as they react to what people before them did, which slows the game down.

I don't mind the luck of the die in a game like this, but did find the luck of the draw dissatisfying - in my one play, right before endgame I drew into two irrigated-tile-arrangement cards I could fulfill as the board lay, which outright handed me victory.

Still - fun, and family-friendly.

RATING: 8.8
This game is so good. We love the theme and the art and the gameplay, and despite of or perhaps because of the fact that we play it with two players, we do not find it so very lucky and light.

Admittedly we do play a non sanctioned variant that we devised where when we choose to draw tiles on our turn, we draw 3 of them and place 2 of them. 

Though our opening round is just to draw three tiles and place 1 of them, and then to do 1 other different action.

Also we play to 12 cards.

It is a beautiful game. One of the ones that we both agree about as to how good it is. We believe it to be one of the best that we own.

This game was fairly boring.  It took way too long between turns in my 4 player game considering how simple the game is.  There is not anything to plan when it is not your turn because the position of the pieces changes before it gets back to your turn and you don't know what power you will be granted by the random roll of the dice to start your turn.  It could work OK as a family game.

A fun game with an appealing theme; beautifully executed. Very good for families, especially where traditional eurogame themes fall flat. Won't appeal to serious gamers. Repeated play shows that some of the paths to victory are unbalanced and there is a large element of luck using the basic rules. The best player does not always win. For me, this is actually a plus, since it allows players of different skill levels to all play competitively. 

2013-07 update - This game hasn't seen as much table time as I thought it would. Down grading to a 7 for waning family appeal.

RATING: 5
Great theme and "feel." Seems like a fun game the first few times, but then the obvious imbalances impose themselves. The nature of the goal cards and their point spread and ease of accomplishment are all out of whack: panda cards are personal points, no one else can get them, but tile display and bamboo grow cards can be shared- this fundamental difference causes problems. Panda cards are, for the most part, very simple to accomplish and generally you are forced, to be competitive, to do about 50% of them.

Other things are too luck based: the tile modifiers require you to roll 1/6th chance in a game where you may only get six turns. So streaky luck kills the fun. It's just too long of a game with too few of those rolls for it to work.

I don't hate it, and would play it, but I don't take it too seriously.

There's this weird dynamic here. This game is fairly cute and looks fun. There's a decent amount of good components in the design. But it's put together in a way that brings them down.

Why? The game disguises the fact that you win by being lucky. Your strategy has little impact in the end due to the randomness of die rolls and the randomness of card-draws. Sure that randomness hits everyone, but there's so much squandered potential for strategic play in this game.

In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game.

This is one of the better gateway games I've played. The theme draws in non-gamers, the rules can be explained in 10 minutes, the components are of decent quality and it plays in about an hour. The color contrasts used in this game proved successful for the color blind player in our group. For gamers looking for more meat, it still has luck built into the game - tile draw, card draw and the weather die. Some of it can be mitigated, but some is just luck. Given how much of a hit it is with non-gamers, this will remain in the collection.

[16 Jan 2018] - 7 (12 plays)
Dropping the rating to a 7. The game does have a fatal flaw in the rules that makes it too easy to run up a huge score without going through the rest of the game. Knowing this flaw, it's easier to play the metagame and the whole experience isn't any fun. I still think this is a great game to keep and pull out when trying to play a game with non-gamers. The panda figure, light rules and colorful artwork appeals to that crowd.

Enjoyed this one. Not sure I'd buy it, but certainly happy to play it again.

Growing the bamboo seemed quite hard to achieve, so we tended to favour the eating tasks until they had run out. Then we realised that terraforming tasks could give you free points if the shape was already there.  (Oh - I wonder if we missed a rule : I don't think we were letting the gardener affect adjacent tiles of the same colour ..?  That might have made the growing tasks a little easier.)

Once the emperor was revealed, I managed to get 14 pts on my last turn, which was a bit of a fluke. (Rolled the sun, so got an extra action. Chose a new task, which gave me an island shape which was a subset of one I was just about to complete ; irrigated a field which let me complete two island tasks; and then chomped the newly-sprouted piece of pink bamboo to complete a feed-my-panda task. Nice one !)

A lovely looking game with a lot of good gameplay. You have to get the most points in one of three ways – by playing tile combinations, by growing certain types of bamboo, or by having the panda eat certain types of bamboo. The wooden pegs for the bamboo are a good weight and the pastel colors make the game look pretty during play.

Fun with kids, my nieces love it. As a gamer's game it doesn't hold up. Without the theme and components this would be a 5. There is no attempt in the design to mitigate blind draws of contract cards, which will determine the winner. The points awarded for contracts are also imbalanced, particularly in the expansion material. 

Maybe the best looking game in my collection, but definitely bottom third overall.

Really, [b]think twice before you buy this game[/b]. Some sweet, soft-hearted member of your family will always want to play it, and you will be stuck between: 

[i]Playing a mediocre game while far better ones languish on your shelf, or 

being the grouch who doesn't love pandas.[/i]

RATING: 7.5
A fun, light, family game.
The production is gorgeous and the gameplay smooth.
I advise playing with the advance variant (if drawing a completed mission: discard and draw a new mission).

I'd also recommend a few variants added in the expansion: 

+3 points for each set of 3 types of missions

to complete panda mission the panda must return to the center tile (pond).

These balance out the panda missions and creates a more meaningful game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very strong light action selection game, my only complaint is that panda eats cards are a heck of a lot easier to fulfil than the other two, especially the layout ones, and the extra points don't feel worth it. Maybe with more players it's a little more balanced but it feels too chaotic for me.

Very cute game! Kids and women love it, how you grow bamboo or how you can move the hungry Panda! 
Requires a bit of strategic thinking but also good tactical abilities! The weather die also works pretty well, giving the necessary variety!
Guaranteed fun, excellent for 2pl as well!

I probably only rate this so highly because it was the first game I ever bought for myself and completely made me fall in love with the hobby. That said I do thoroughly enjoy it at all play counts and have never not wanted to play it when it's been suggested. The theme is adorable, the components are lovely and colourful and there are a few different paths to victory which I really like.

I think this misses the mark of a good game due to excessive simplicity and length.  It needs to be about 30 minutes shorter.  It took us about 1 hour and the game really needs to play under 30 minutes.

That said, the mini's and bamboo towers are cool enough looking to get it a extra point.  It really should be a 4 based on BGG description.

Players are gardeners the royal garden of the emperor of Japan, tending the bamboo plants and keeping the hungry panda (a gift from China) happy.  Super cute game, where players take turns choosing two actions from a list of five possibilities.  Actions include expanding the garden (hex tiles), moving the gardener (causing bamboo to grow), moving the panda (who eats bamboo!), irrigating the garden, or choosing a hidden victory point goal.  Bamboo comes in three colours - pink, yellow and green.  The object is to complete the secret objective cards, to earn victory points.  The cards award points for matching the garden layout, growing bamboo in certain combinations of colour and height, or feeding the panda certain bamboo colour combinations.  A very easy game to teach and play, and it reminds me a lot of hidden objective games such as Ticket to Ride and Ankh-Morpork.  The looks absolutely beautiful on the table too - the stackable wooden bamboo pieces are stunning, and the rest of the game isn't too shabby either.  Well worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Simple and clever family strategy game. The cute components also add to the charm. There are a few aspects of the game that could have been better (irrigation is not used often, and the watershed development is way more powerful than the others). Overall though we've been enjoying it.

I got this game for my birthday. It's a fun, simple game that is more tactical than strategic.  The theme is a little silly, but the nice components draw me into it. I've only played with two players, but I can imagine that this games gets more random/chaotic as the number of players increases. 

After a few more plays, I found that there is some strategy to this game (not just tactics and reaction). It's subtle, but it's there, and there is still a lot of luck involved in the card draws.

RATING: 7
Game gets a massive plus based on components. This is good light euro gateway game. Plays well with two and is good with all numbers. It's fun, but slightly flawed, the game has a lot of luck involved with the card draw. Perhaps it's just me but the panda cards seem to be the best. There is a advanced variant in the rules that I would suggest always playing with. All that aside I wouldn't turn down a game of this right now and I think (though I do not know) that the expansion may alleviate some of the issues that I have with it.

Addendum: though this is far from my favourite game, it's a damn charming way to spend 45 minutes, and as I said, the components are gorgeous.

Idea:
Grow bamboo and feed panda with it.

Mechanism:
get two actions + one die rolled action per round. Board will consist of three different colors that grow its color of bamboo
Create board while you play and try to fill out goal cards that either require certain formation of board tiles on play or certain bamboo growth on board or fed certain types of bamboo to panda.

Quite easy to learn and still has some replayability. Good for kids.

Special: Played big version of game where tiles and tokes were way bigger than normal like 15cm. Very cute layout.

Bought after seeing on Tabletop. I actually found a used copy in pristine condition and bought it at Half Price Books in Austin, Texas. I find this to be a great game to have a conversation over because you don't really need to pay too much attention to the game when it's not your turn. And it's one of the most beautiful games, from a component perspective, that I currently own.

RATING: 6
A game where the bits are so good that you just have to play it, even though you know the game probably won't be as good as the bits.   It's a game of completing secret goals in three different types.   A very light action-selection game with a fair amount of luck.   I'm not convinced that the start player doesn't have a huge advantage.  They are most likely to go out first, and they get a +2 pt bonus on top of that.   So the gameplay is only mediocre, but it's still probably a game worth having for the unique theme, incredible bits, and the fact that you can probably get any family to play it with you.

Nagyszerű családi játék. Egyszerű és logikus szabályok, ami először egy kezdőnek soknak tűnhet. Ezért nem "getaway" játék. Egyébként tökéletesen összerakott, egyedi hangulattal rendelkező kis játék, aminek minden eleme a helyén van és jól használható. Csak ajánlani tudom! (2014.03.22.)
3 játék után kicsit egyenlőtlennek érzem a célkártyákat, ami nem von le a játék élményfaktorából szerencsére. Még nem néztem utána a fórum oldalakon, de az eddigi játékok alapján mintha a parcella célkártyákat aránytalanul nehéz lenne teljesíteni, az értük járó díjazást tekintve. Ezzel szemben nálunk a kertész kártyák voltak a legnépszerűbbek. Mindenesetre a játékélmény továbbra is kiváló, megérte beszerezni a játékot! (2014.03.24.)
Kipróbáltam egy másik stratégiát, s arra jöttem rá, ha 3 fős játéknál ketten is a pandás célkártyára gyúrnak, annak esélye sincs, aki a kertész célkártyákkal próbálkozik. A lényeg, hogy érdemes a többiek játékát figyelni, s ahhoz igazítani a sajátunkat. Még mindig kiváló családi játéknak tartom, ahol azért kell egy tanuló játék, amíg a szabályok tisztázódnak, de utána felhőtlen a szórakozás :). (2014.03.26.)
Új játékosoknak rendszeresen meggyűlik a bajuk egy-egy szabály értelmezésével, de a második játékra általában kikristályosodik a kép. Mostanában a panda célkártya lett a menő, az fogy el a játék végére. A parcellás célkártyák pedig szerintem a játék egyetlen hibája (ha a szerencse faktort elfogadjuk). A hangulata továbbra is kiváló és egyik menet sem ugyanolyan, így az újrajátszhatósági faktora is rendkívül magas. Megunhatatlan - egyenlőre. (2014.03.28.)

RATING: 8
This game is a little deceptive.  After new gamers get past the usual set of gateway games (your Ticket to Rides, your Carcassone’s, your Alhambra’s, your basic Dominion sets), I pull this little game out.  They look at the cute little panda and the little pastel bamboo stalks, roll their eyes and say, ‘you’ve got to be kidding?!?’  But after a few rounds (of not really taking it seriously), a realization starts to dawn on them that this cute little game actually packs a punch.  They suddenly realize they’ve got to start to plan sequences of events in advance and look at the game board as a real puzzle to solve.  That smirk on their face turns into a stare of deep concentration as the board expands and the puzzle in front of them becomes more complex and something of a challenge.  They hold their breath as another player moves the gardener or the panda and reconfigures the bamboos, possibly to their detriment.   
However, to make this game a bit more balanced and more of a challenge, I would recommend playing the game with your objective cards open on the table so that other players can see how their actions could potentially reward or block other players.  However, if the group is prone to Analysis Paralysis, you might want to forget about that option.  Additionally, the optional rule (mentioned in the rulebook) of only allowing new objectives to be taken by players that haven’t already been achieved, is both good and fair.  
It would be great if the designers could find a way to come out with an expansion to add a 5th player.

RATING: N/A
It's a light and fun game to play, but I don't feel I need to own this.

I certainly admire the objective card mechanic in the game. You get points by following what your objective card shows. Throughout the game, you can draw more objective cards to score more points. Basically, this is what runs the game.

Great pieces but the copy I played (own by a boardgame cafe) was heavily worn out (the cardboard pieces), obviously due to bad handling by players. 

From the designer of 7 Wonders, what a surprise!

I think it is an OK game to me. Nothing great or nothing spectacular. Still, like I said, I admire the in-game objective cards.

[b][Update17thNOV2013][/b] After watching this on the tabletop show, I instantly feels that I need to play and own the game. It looks really fun and would be something good for my gaming library. Hopefully it's plays good with 2 too.

Me and my wife play this game 2 player and it works brilliantly. 
The weather dice doesn't affect your turn that much so the outcome of a game is very much based on how well you played. 

A 2 player game takes us 30 mins (almost exactly!) from the time we open the box to closing again, theres always time for Panda!

Rating lowered.  As one of my earlier purchases, I was predisposed to liking Takenoko.  What's not to like?  It's colorful, has a simple ruleset and it's lovingly produced (I have the larger 1st-edition).  It always draws a crowd because it just looks so good, but as they say, looks aren't everything.

It's hard to recommend Takenoko as a family game or a gateway game.  There's simply not enough meat on its bones to hook a noob into the hobby and as far as family games go, so long as you only want to play it the one time, it'll be fine.  In the end, I feel like there's just a fun-factor that's missing.  It doesn't make it a bad game, mind you, and I'll gladly sit down to play it because it does its job as a nice, short, low-complexity game.  But the luck-based nature of its mechanics combined means you're really just going through the motions and you're never really quite engaged.  On both categories of family and gateway, there are better choices out there.

If anything, Takenoko is like a walk through a park on a sunny day at the perfect temperature - it's an enjoyable experience, but I'd still rather be doing something else.

RATING: 7.75
This is a light weight action-selection game about the interactions between a gardener and panda in the imperial garden of the Japanese emperor.  Players choose actions such as laying down a plot of land, irrigating a field, using the gardener to grow bamboo, or moving the panda to eat the bamboo.  Players score points based on goal cards that require either certain types of bamboo to be consumed, a certain level of bamboo growth, or a certain pattern of irrigated fields.

The game is really easy to learn and pretty fun to play.  It contains a good dose of luck in the form of the goal cards drawn and a die roll to determine a bonus action.  The game is also really aesthetically pleasing with its bright colors and 3D element when the bamboo start growing.  This is a great family or gateway game to introduce people into the hobby.

Nothing particularly innovative in terms of mechanics but publisher did a nice job with presentation and artwork. If you've ever been to a Japanese stationery store, this captures that look and feel exactly. Not for the no-luck crowd as a favorable card draw or die roll can swing things.

I had this at 7.5.  It's beautiful but empty.

This is a beautiful game and one that kids can pick up very easily even though it has gameplay like no other.  However, there's something missing and I can't quite put my finger on it.  I do know that scoring is completely messed up and random.  I've tried to fix the game with a number of house rules, but it's still a little thin on strategy.  A good investment however, and it's frequently requested by young people.

8/13 ... "thin on strategy" ... you're probably never thinking more than two moves ahead. But tactical.

6/14 ... went from 6.5 back to 7.5.  I finally figured out that if you treat this as a nice light game it's enjoyable.  Don't try to make this into more than it is.

Top. Notch. Components. Smooth and pleasant experience. There is a lot of luck between the die roll and drawing symbiotic objective cards. No strategy here, just tactics. But don't take it too seriously and the components will whisk you away. A lovely family game.

Really cute and well-suited for family play, although the improvement tiles feel out of place -- they come up very rarely, are very limited in placement, and exceedingly situational in use. It's not something we'll play again in my primary group, but I'm looking forward to my kid(s) being old enough to play this at home.

Nice artwork and quality pieces and a fun theme.  Not too difficult to learn and play and it moves somewhat fast.  not sure its one i'll really want to play again though.  my biggest complaint is the game boils down to drawing good goal cards as some are easier and more rewarding than others.  also at the end of the game you can keep drawing more and hope to already have them accomplished, there is no penalty for doing so.  kinda killed the game for me.

The most appealing part of this game is the components. They are colourful, appealing and of high quality. They will draw almost anyone to your table to investigate and can be an incentive for new players. I enjoyed the shifting weather patterns and the variety of point-scoring options.

We struggled a bit with formulating strategies early on. As the game played, we found that an opponent was just as likely to complete one of our objectives as we were. There was a feeling that as players we had little control over our success.

Takenoko feels chaotic and left us a little unsatisfied, but it's a very cute chaotic and it can still be fun.

Glad I got this one in after all. I have the rectangle Multilingual version with the custom molded insert so everything fits like a dream, the components are high quality and the upkeep is not as fiddly as I'd have imagined it to be. My husband loves it and seeing as he's the one who requested it I'm very pleased. I initially thought it would be way too light for him as he is a fan of Chess and Go and we already have so many light games in the collection but this is fun, lucky, strategic and just a good time to be had by all. Rating raised to 8. Solid.

I learned and played this game online at Board Game Arena. It took me a few plays to 'get' the game, but once I did it ended up being really fun and slightly addictive. I now kick azz at it :) I feel the cards could use a better balance - 1 bamboo grown 4 high on a fertiliser tile is easy enough to complete relatively painlessly (can even be done in the same turn!), but 4 green bamboo 3 high is super difficult and I always seem to draw that one...aaargh! Aside from that, I love the way the game plays, I love the artwork, and I love the components. If a good deal fell into my lap I'd consider it, but I'm not actively seeking out a copy. A few things keep me from  pulling the trigger on this one:
Do I need another light/family weight/tile placement/set collecting game? My collection has ample amounts of all.
How is game maintenance/upkeep in real life? Seems like it would be kind of tedious and fiddly with placing which bamboo segments grow, removing bamboo, growing only where irrigated etc.

RATING: 5
A "mission completion", family game where you're trying to complete different missions on three types of cards. You're either getting colored tiles in certain configurations, growing bamboo stalks to certain heights, or having the panda eat certain colored bamboo stalks. You get two actions per turn and start your turn rolling the die for a special bonus which may be an extra action that turn or something else that assists you towards your missions. 

Due to the die roll which may offer you exactly what you need or be useless and the randomness of other people unknowingly stepping on your plans (e.g., having the panda eat the bamboo you were trying to grow), there's a good bit of luck here in how many times your little spider has to go back up the water spout. 

The production is excellent and the game exudes a high cuteness factor. The panda and farmer figures that come with the game are painted plastic minis not meeples (pandeeple?) and the bamboo stalks look great as they populate the board. A great family offering but not enough substance here for more serious gamers.

I like the game as it is. A typical family game, but without the eager to play another round immediately. The cards you draw can be a little unfair/unbalanced between the players (since you are stuck with the 5 cards until you score them, and also since the points are very different from card to card). I like the die in this game. The die bonuses are interesting, and also quite equally strong, but of course depending on the timing. Good to have in my collection, but I don't see that it will come to the table very often. Rating might go up or down, depending on the replayability. Nice components.

RATING: 5
Simple neat game but totally unballanced as far as scoring is concerned. 3 points for an objective where you need to place and irrigate 4 terrain tiles vs an objective where you get 6 points for eating three bamboo pieces? Oh c'mon! The scoring is totally broken. All the rest works fine and it's a pity points you get for objectives ruin the whole game.

Not a good game for 4 ppl as with that number of players it is pretty difficult to plan anything ahead.

Sure it's light, and sure it's random, but Takenoko is one of my favorite gateway-type games.  It's got enough luck involved that new players at the table have a decent chance of beating me, but enough fun choices that I can stay engaged.  Also, every single time I play this, the conversation turns ridiculous, with people making om nom nom noises when the panda eats bamboo, and other assorted silliness.  That, to me, is the definition of a good game - when people play it, they are [i]having fun[/i]

It's a kids game; not my thing. 

Not much to challenge a mind over the age of 12 or so. And FWIW I think the age 8+ recommendation may be a bit off. Too many little conditions that will challenge an avg 8 year-old. 9+ would be better IMO.

I wonder if you could break this game by simply grabbing as many field and bamboo objectives as possible since they can [largely] be serendipitously completed by other players.

Way too light for my taste.  The components which are outstanding but the game is disappointing. It's a shame because the gardener/panda mechanic is an interesting twist, but I don't like the scoring mechanism; the objectives are hidden so you go through the motions and soon you realise that you won't catch up to the player who got the red objectives while you got the green. It starts out nice, the flow is interesting but quickly you want it to be over.  And it is for me.

Takenoko is a beautiful, light game involving tile placement making up a shared board, stacking wooden pieces (growing bamboo) and moving a panda and a gardener in straight lines across the board in order to meet objectives specific to me.  It's not a heavy game, but it may take non-gamers a bit of time to get used to the idea of sharing all components but the cards.  I'm not usually a fan of hidden objectives in games, and that's the whole game in this case.  But it's pretty and simple enough that I won't mind it bringing it out occasionally, and I know my girls will absolutely love it.

Yellow and green look the same on cards; red and green look the same on tiles.  Not colorblind-friendly at all.

I will probably never play this game again because of the color issues.

The game itself was pretty enjoyable.  Given that there are two criteria for the BGG rating system ('want-to-play rating' and 'good/bad' rating), I averaged the two (7 for gameplay, 3 for the fact that I can't play).

If I manage to find or buy a converted copy, or a new edition is colorblind-friendly, then I will update this rating.

Helyes kis játék, amit valószínőleg szinte bárki szívesen játszik. Szabályai arányleg egyszerűek, de azért a kezdőknek lehetnek vele problémái. A kivitelézés gyönyörű.

A játék folyamán területlapkákat kell letennünk, azokon bambuszt növesztenünk víz és kertészünk segítségével, illetve bambuszt leenni a pandával. A pontokat háromféle titkos célkártya adja, amikből a játék folyamán szerezhetünk még.

Mivel a célkártyákat és területlapokat is véletlenszerűen húzzuk így szerencse szerepe szerintem igen a nagy játékban. Ezen felül érzésem szerint csak evésre van értelme mennünk, mivel azzal szinte biztosan nem segítünk senkinek (jó esélllyel inkább hátráltatjuk a többieket), míg magunkanak gyűlnek a pontok. A másik két céllaptípust jóval nehezebb teljesíteni, ráadásul közben másnak is kikaparhatod a gesztenyét. Ugyan ezek több pontot hoznak a konyhára, de szerintem nem eléggé.

Kedves ki színes családi játék, amiben kicsit lehet agyalni is, de ne várjon senki mondjuk tikal szintű játékmenetet.

Takenoko is pretty good family entertainment, but exactly how much of that is due to presentation is debatable. The game looks gorgeous, there's no denying that. The way the goal cards are assigned and completed, however, inserts a lot of randomness into an already chaotic game. Some people will get their goals served on a silver platter, others will have their carefully groomed bamboo garden inadvertently trampled on by the other players. The game is pretty quick so that is not the end of the world but if a game's primary selling point is good looks, that is rarely a compliment.

RATING: 7.7
Fun game, although the strategy is a little light. My main complaint is the cards. There are 3 categories of cards, each with their own merit in terms of difficulty. What I don't like is that the point values for each card seem arbitrary. Many cards that clearly require more energy to fulfill are worth 2 or 3 points, while some Panda cards that take almost no effort to fulfill are worth 5 or 6 points. If the points were distributed based on difficulty of completing the card then I think this could be a great game. As it is, it's just a fun cute game.

Un ami, plutôt axé jeux sans trop de hasard et relativement calculatoires, a une compagne. Celle-ci est assez joueuse, tant par sa volonté propre que sous les harcèlements de cet ami. Mais le souci, c'est que leurs goûts se rejoignent parfois, mais qu'en général il y a une rupture visuelle. Alors devant un petit panda et un style assez "kawaï", elle a craqué. Et lui, dans une démarche de compromis bien évidente, accepte de jouer à "Takenoko", bien que ce ne soit pas son type de jeu favori (un peu trop light). Et c'est comme ça que je me suis retrouvé à y jouer.

Depuis, on débat souvent sur la qualité et l'intérêt de celui-ci. Sachant que lui y a beaucoup plus joué que moi, il en est un peu lassé et ne le sort pas vraiment avec plaisir. Pour ma part, je trouve ce format plus léger et familial/rapide est vraiment agréable, tant qu'on ne s'attend pas à un jeu avec des mécanismes compliqués ou avec un profondeur inouïe. Mais nous débattons aussi régulièrement sur la difficulté attribuée à un jeu. Car moi, ma chérie, n'est pas joueuse du tout. Sauf quelques jeux d'ambiance, mais ça s'arrête là. Et même un jeu comme "Takenoko", c'est trop. Du coup ça me donne une autre vision des choses. Ce jeu est certes familial, mais pour des personnes désirant s'investir dans le monde ludique, pas pour des gens qui repoussent le monde du jeu de société. Dès qu'il y a quelques subtilités (et il y en a dans "Takenoko"), plus de trois paragraphes de règles, ça peut repousser et être vécu comme sortant du pur divertissement. Ce qu'on trouve tous les deux dommage, bien sûr, mais bon, respectons les choix de chacun.

Donc voilà, on a une approche un peu différente de cet objet ludique. Lui en a ras-le-bol du hasard mis en place par le dé et le tirage aléatoire des objectifs, qui peut bloquer et laisser un joueur à la traîne sans qu'il n'ait l'impression de mal jouer ou de faire les mauvais choix. Pour ma part, ce genre de paramètres ne me gêne que peu dans ce format de jeu et j'apprécie qu'il y ait une forme de hasard dans le jeu, auquel on doit s'adapter. Et je ne dis pas ça parce que je fais des jets de malade, la dernière fois c'est moi qui en ai souffert d'ailleurs, mais ça ne m'a pas gêné. Car si le jeu est vraiment simple au niveau des choix à faire, il bénéficie de mécanismes très fluides et rend l'ensemble efficace. Pour moi, "Takenoko" est donc un très bon jeu dans ce format, qui peut servir à initier des nouveaux joueurs qui acceptent d'écouter des règles plus d'1m30. Je prends un plaisir à y jouer, c'est souvent des parties assez tranquilles, même si ce n'est pas l'extase ludique et que ce format n'est sans doute pas mon favori, il est nécessaire et agréable et l'As d'or le valorise d'une belle manière en récompensant "Takenoko".

Au moins, nous sommes entièrement d'accord sur un point. Le visuel et la qualité du matériel. C'est assez constant chez Matagot, d'une part ça attire l’œil en magasin et permet de faire découvrir le monde du jeu à de nouveaux clients, d'autre part ça donne vraiment envie d'y jouer, quelque soit le joueur. Les couleurs sont plaisantes, et le fait de voir les bambous grandir est quelque chose que j'apprécie beaucoup. Le thème est donc très bien adapté, pas spécialement aux mécanismes, mais à l'esprit et au sentiment général du jeu. Ce qui est l'une des grandes forces d'Antoine Bauza.

I should like this base game more but the scoring system from mission-card-only is poor.
1) Very hard to catch up the leader in each game
2) Drawing troll who intend to draw a lot of tiles or gardener mission card can win too easy in 4 players game.
3) Panda mission is easy but it require your 2-3 actions to complete each one while score of each card is too low. The more your try to finish Panda card, the more chance you lost game.

I like this game more when I bought the Chibi expansion. It add baby pandas point that you can convert an action into points plus benefit from baby panda. Sometime it help us to catch up with the leader in game. Situation can be flipped anytime if you're solely focusing on mission point. It add more fun back to game.
So if you like this game. I'd recommend to add Chibi expansion as well.

What's not to like about this game?  The artwork is amazing.  The quality of the components are outstanding.  The rules are easy to understand and easy to teach.  What's really cool about the game is how it starts out a little slow but then progressively speeds up because a lot of land tiles will be laid out and a lot of bamboo will have already been grown.  Great game and the kids love it as well.

Very beautiful game, the  panda and the gardener miniatures plus the nice artwork were the main things that compelled me to play. Moreover, despite the abstract objective cards, the game is pretty thematic. I however did not enjoy it too much (1.5 plays) as the players did not actively interact with each other and the gameplay seemed really-really simple. E.g. in my opinion, even compared to Ticket to Ride, Takenoko has both considerably less interaction and is noticably lighter.

I've been waiting a long time to finally play Takenoko. First off, it's a cute game! It has a pleasant feel to how one plays their turn. At the end of the day though, I feel luck and randomness really play too much of a role here.  I found the whether die could really influence what a player could do- either give a huge bonus or stick you with some useless crap. The point system on the cards didn't seem balanced; even though there are less of some colours (so more points are awarded for them) our board was very asymmetrical to how it should have looked given the tile distribution. Perhaps tile manipulation is too easy here? Anyway, I also found by the end it was a 40-50% chance that you could draw a score card where the requirements were already fulfilled or at least one step away. Made for boring game play. Fortunately, I don't think Takenoko tries to be anything more than what it is, so I don't fault it for being too light for my tastes. I'm sure this is a great game to get kids into some of the more subtler flavours of modern board games.

Cute filler that takes only 50 minutes to complete. I suspect that if the game hadn't come with cute components, the appeal would go down approx. 50% since it's very luck-based and not well balanced (the "land" objectives are much easier to fulfill than the other two). But then again, surely everyone has a soft spot for pandas :-p

I wish there was slightly better balancing on the goal cards, especially the plot and panda ones. I think that could have boosted this game up a notch for experience gamers and the replay-ability.

As it is, it's still an excellent game for new players and gamers to play together.

One 2-player game with my wife so far.  It's very simple with only 5 actions to choose from.  My wife feels like the optimal strategy is to draw Panda objective cards and to avoid the garden plot cards, which she thinks are too difficult to complete.  I'm not convinced yet, but she beat me soundly (40-28) in our first game.

The components are amazing, it's fast (our first game, including rules, took an hour), and it's pretty easy to teach and learn.

I'd highly recommend that everyone at least try this game.

As with most of Antoine's designs, the mechanisms are seemlessly woven in to the theme and I feel his is one of his best along with Ghost Stories. The depth of strategy and overall fun of the game far exceeded my expectations - a reason I was late to the party.

*Update* As I have grown as a gamer I find the game to be a pleasant if pedestrian experience, with little depth of strategy. Still a solid family game, though.

Beautiful components and the game really is quick to teach and play. It seems like its hard to find fault but I do have some slight qualms...it's nearly impossible to willingly ruin your opponents plans because there are simply too many random objective cards and too few actions per turn. You're virtually guaranteed to use all of your actions with the sole intent on satisfying only your personal objectives. (Granted, you can screw up your opponents plans on accident trying to fulfill your own.)
One of the bigger complaints is that some of the objective cards seem way more valuable and easy to complete than others. The panda eating 2 reds for 5 points for example. Im not sure know why I would ever take a card for tile pattern objectives when I could get the easy and valuable panda food cards. The gardner cards also because they are worth more.
Its a good game, but a little too much luck involved.

Where has this game been all my life? Like another Bauza game, Tokaido, it's lighthearted and simple with set collection agendas. Here, however, additional action choices and more freedom of movement make the experience more involved. It's that you'll unlikely figure out your opponents' agendas, so it's tough to play aggressively. But hey! When you're prodding an adorable panda around tiles trying to fill his chubby belly who needs confrontation? A delightful game!

I think of this game as convoluted and worse Ticket to Ride. Just like in TtR, you draw some goals and hope to fulfil them and all of the interaction is hoping that no one else takes your spot. The difference here is that the goals are more random so there's no way to know if you're helping or hurting your opponents. This makes the game very random and every turn feels somewhat pointless. The rules are also needlessly complicated, which makes it unappealing for many TtR fans.

My husband and I give Takenoko a rating of 7 with two players. We haven't played with more people yet. The rules are clearly written and simple to grasp, and we can remember all of them without frequent references to the rulebook. The variety of actions provide plenty of scope for exploring different strategies, yet the limited number of actions to take each turn keep us from feeling overwhelmed by choices. The theme is peaceful and supports the game mechanisms well. The components are well-made and look pretty on the table. Luck is a definite element, but not so strong that it overwhelms skill. We think that Takenoko will become a perennial favorite.

So glad I bought it. 2nd half of 2011 was the time of failures for me. This is the 1st game in a long while that didn't disappoint. It looks absolutely gorgeous (it helps that I love oriental theme), it has my favorite mechanics - action points and secret goals. Everything works extremely well. Due to wonderful theme integration, the game is super easy to teach. Note however - this is pretty much family and non-gamer affair. I think this is the 1st real contender for the 2012 SDJ.

Brilliant art and excellent production values, it looks beautiful. Missions, however, are limited and become repetitive. An expansion with more missions would have benefited this game. It's easy to play and the theme is original. The splashes of color on the table alone make Takenoko worth playing.

Looks like a game of an asian designer but no, he is French. The theme and grafic style aims at families and the designer succeeded in creating a game that is not difficult to understand but still offers many ways to go for victory. This was a surprise as I initially thought this game would fail with me. Good written rules too. Rating after one game (7).

edit: I really enjoyed my first game but after my second game I had to downrate it. The game lacks of depth and interaction.
An "advanced" rule says: "If a player picks an objective card already completed in the bamboo garden, he must discard it and picks a new objective card". I the later game I choose an plot card and yep I had to discard it, as it was already fulfilled. So as the next and the next and the ubernext. I just emptied half of the objective pile. Then I changed to gardener objectifs and even there the first two cards were already fulfilled. I really consider it as a design flaw if you are somehow urged to throw away 10+ cards until you get a "valid" one.

A pleasing game about a gardener and a panda that won't stop eating his bamboo. Every turn the player rolls the Weather dice and does two actions, which usually can't be repeated. They're mostly about placing new tiles,  irrigating terrain and moving the characters to grow bamboo (gardener) and eat it (panda). The main goal is to complete success conditions on goal cards.

Like Ticket To Ride -- too slow for a gateway game, and success is based on whether you draw the right objective cards late in the game when it's possible to achieve them trivially.

And the cuteness stops mattering quickly because the game is pretty abstract. If only Bauza designed games that feel special, in addition to looking special.

Redeeming factor: Having a different number of tiles in each color adds interesting texture.

On the good side, the competition in the game can get exciting towards the end.  The board space and components draw non-players in to see what's going on.  And the art and component quality are very high.

On the not so good side, there are a couple of broken parts --- for example, the weather die can often, especially in late game, affect no one in any way. Also, like Tokaido, while it's a beautifully done theme, it's not terribly intriguing.

On the whole it's a solid game with interesting (though not truly thrilling) choices. I imagine it'd be a good intro game, and would work especially well with the 8-12 yr old crowd.

It may work as a family game, despite the excess of randomness and lack of balance. It's common to draw objective cards that have been already completed and score easy points (or almost completed, if you use the optional rule of discarding completed ones). Interaction between players is limited to unknowingly helping your opponents complete objectives or messing with them a bit. But the is mildly pleasant and relaxing. The excellent production, with beautiful artwork, cool "bamboo" pieces and painted miniatures, surely helps a lot in its success.

This game's theme is superb! It could not be about anything other than a panda eating away at your garden's bamboo. All the mechanics fit in really well.

The game's art/design is very well executed too. There's the rulebook (which includes a lovely comic), the beautiful box (all components fit snugly and it stays on the table as bamboo reserve), the great drawings all over and of course the ingenious bamboo.

It all makes for a very accessible and fun game.

A possible downside of the game: 
The luck of the draw is very decisive. Different values are attached to each colour (pink=highest, green=lowest) and I don't think these differences are leveled out by a supposed difficulty level of completing each objective.

A legaranyosabb játék, amivel eddig találkoztam (pláne, hogy párom imádja a pandákat).
Könnyen tanulható szabályok, szép és nyelvfüggetlen játékelemek, ráadásul a doboz belső is igényesen rendezett (mindennek külön helye van).
Van benne egy kis stratégia is, de inkább a mázli faktor a meghatározóbb. Igaz szerintem a legjobb a kertész és a panda célokat teljesíteni (etetni a pandát, mozgatni a kertészt) a többiek meg úgyis építik a kertet.:)

My favorite game EVER. It's so cute and colorful and has a PANDA. But don't be fooled! There is a lot going on here and there can be a lot of strategy involved. Weather patterns are a nice element. They add a tiny bit of chance to the game without it being ruled by random dice rolls. The weather patterns really only effect optional things you can do on your turn like eat a piece of bamboo anywhere, grow one piece of bamboo anywhere, pick up a helpful token, take a 3rd action or ability to repeat 2 of the same actions on your turn. They can help and add some bit of spontaneity, but they don't wreck your strategy either.

An interesting game in that you can approach winning in three different ways.  Finding a blend of the three works best, yet two of the goals (panda vs. gardener) will generally act against one another.  You can see which cards others have though, and try to balance your objectives accordingly.

I feel like the tile placement objectives may be too easily reached, especially in the late game.  Maybe better panda/gardener play would help eliminate that risk.

Incredible components. (Painted minis, painted wooden bamboo components, good quality tiles and player aids.)

Prosta w tłumaczeniu, efektownie wykonana i przyjemna w rozgrywce. 

EN: We played it once, and only because Aga loves pandas. The game itself is pretty much complicated - it has many elements that at first glance don't work together. For me, the phenomenon was this guy who explained us the rules using uncanny words and lots of positive energy. During the game players make a lot of actions in order to complete certain tasks. This is good 50 zł boardgame. Unfortunately, it currently costs 115 zł, and frankly is not worth that much.

Played this once at a game cafe. It was a fine game, I would play it again, but it dropped off my wishlist complete once I played it because I just don't see myself wanting to play it often. I sort of felt it was a little too heavy for being as random as it is.

Wonderful components to hype up a somewhat normal Eurogame. Definitely not soulless, but rich in theme, with style. Unfortunately, in my one play, I didn't find the cards properly balanced - I kept drawing 2 point cards, which didn't get me anywhere, while others were getting easier cards with 5 points. Would try again nevertheless, maybe I was just really out of luck.

Played the collector's edition, which is fun but excessively priced and overdone. Card/tile draw aspect is too random for my taste. Some cards are difficult to fulfill no matter how much you try while it's possible to get other cards that are already completed. Still I would play it again and it's a light game the whole family can play.

Nagyon kellemes hangulatú családi játék. Hatalmas szerencsefaktor van benne, mert a célkártyákat véletlenszerűen húzzuk fel. És ha olyat kapunk a kertészből amin külön jelölő kell és nem dobunk a kockával olyat, amelyből ilyen jelölőt felvehetünk, máris ez a kártya feleslegesen foglalja a kezünkben a helyet. Más meg felhúz olyan kártyát, amely rögtön meg is valósult már és azonnal írja a pontot. A gyakorlottabb játékosok nem is rakják ki az összes elkészült lapjaikat, hanem amikor már a vége felé van a játéknak, egyszerre játsszák ki őket.

Több mint 40 játékkal a hátam mögött, egyértelműen kijelenthető, hogy nagyon nagy a szerencse szerepe a játékban, egyrészt a kockadobás másrészt a kártyahúzás miatt. Semmiféle mechanizmus nincs a játékban a rossz dobások és a rossz laphúzások ellensúlyozására.  
Ezért az eredeti 8-as osztályzatot 7-esre módosítom.

We really love this game. It is imbalanced, so you'll probably have to house rule things to make it a better play. A good rule that I've heard is that you only get points for cards you complete if you've complete them in a set (one of each kind). Another recommended one is that you discard a card if you can immediately complete it when you draw it. 

Regardless, it's a light game with enough decisions to keep people entertained and invested. Plus, there's a Panda!

Takenoko is a modern gaming classic, hands down. The game-play is diverse, with the right balance of strategy and luck. No two games will play the same, thanks to the tile laying element. The art and theme add to the enjoyment factor. Knowing when to grow bamboo and when to send the ravenous panda in to eat it is certainly important to achieving victory. I'm always eager to play Takenoko!

I have to admit that when my friend asked me to look at the box to Takenoko and asked me what I thought, I summarily dismissed it out of hand based on the pink bamboo and cartoon panda.  Boy, was that foolish of me!  This is a very fun light strategy game.  Purists will deride the excessive element of luck via the weather die rolled before each turn as well as drawing objective cards--which range from being able to complete with one simple action to an epic project like digging the Panama Canal.  However, if you can accept the element of luck, the game is very entertaining, it is relatively simple and easy to share with non-gamers, and plays in a relatively short amount of time.

This game looks awesome. Third game is a lot faster than the first two games. I think getting a lot of cards in the beginning is speeding it up. I like it and I am curious about what we will discover about it.

This game looks so great! Only the site makes you fall in love with it. Its is a familygame. No big strategies involved but you have to think things over. I think with 4 its gets more random but with 2 or 3 you have to think over what you do so make it harder for you opponent to reach his goal. Beautifull and very accessible game!

This is my new favorite game. I've played several times and it never gets old. This is a great game for us women. 

There's no violence, nor offensive graphics, nor sexist language (other than the directions assuming all players are men.) This is probably the most feminist game I've played in several years, in that it doesn't gender the game other than one set of bamboo (out of 3) is pink.

My hubby and son love this game as much as I do, as do some of the men in our gamer groups.

This is a game tweens & teens would love. It plays best with 3-4 players.

Annoyed with how a set of gardens with high values (of which you might complete one when you have intelligent competition) might lose you the game before you even start.

A good intro game.  Very simple to learn.  The components are 50/50.  The panda and farmer are good, dice is decent but the bamboo are different sizes.

Once you move past the cutesy and childish theme, you'll find a surprisingly fun little game here that is far more interesting than the kids games I grew up with.

Overall, it can be quite fun as long as you don't take it too seriously (and how could you, with the theme?)

What a great game. It scales well with 2 - 4 players, is relatively fast, engaging, and fun to play. I think the theme makes it even better.

RATING: 8.5
Cute... would be #1 if cute was a theme being ranked on BGG.

The game itself is fun, although the ability to hold onto completed cards does give the end game a bit of a rushed feeling... might be improved with some small house rules.

But this is not really a complaint. For a family friendly 1 hour game with components this good, it's really one the the best I've played.

RATING: 7
Saw this game in my local game store, with the charming art design and concept piquing my curiosity. After reading some mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance on it...

What I found was a simple, but beautiful and elegant game. The theme and components (as everyone seems to mention) really shine, and the game is almost meditative to play. It's pretty straightforward, with juuuust enough player interaction (or interference, one could say) to make things interesting without infringing upon the peaceful spirit of the game. Quite a lovely experience. 

I personally found that the tile cards didn't reward nearly enough points for the amount of work they usually require, so when I play I just double their point values. It has made for a much more balanced game, in my experience.

You get to move a panda around the board and feed him bamboo.  This game is precious and adorable.  Not to sound sexist, but if you are having trouble finding a game for the women-folk in your life to play, this one seldom fails.  Few people, man or woman, can resist the adorableness of panda.

The game isn't too bad either - it has the makings of a simple abstract game that hides it depth. It does seem a bit unbalanced, however, as feeding the Panda seems to be the easiest way to victory (either that or having other players accidentally accomplish one's objectives).

My other main complaint is that the rules are a bit clunky. It is very easy to overlook a rule. Still, it's a nice production and a pleasant game that I enjoy from time-to-time.

A beautiful and simple game.  Maybe a little too easy at times. Would work well as a gateway game. If you're playing with hardcore gamers, you should use the variant where if you draw a card and that objective is already completed, you can't score it.

Good light, gateway style game.  It will be very easy to get this to the table with new people.

Luck based, you have to do the best you can with what you got, and you have to hope your opponents don't get all the higher scoring cards. It happened to us, but just because you cause the scoring round, doesn't mean you are going to win.

Everyone is trying to expand a common field so that the farmer can grow bamboo and the panda can eat it.  Each player accumulates personal goal cards over the course of the game that relate to those three activities, which are played for points when the goals are met.

Really cute. Munching bamboo is fun. But we didn't think there was much depth to the game. Granted, it was only one play through, but it just seemed more of a silly (meant in a positive way) game (albeit with a pretty extensive set of rules: you'll need some patience at the start) for kids.

Cute and fun, Takenoko is a relaxing game of completing requests of the emperor. The quests fall into 3 basic catagories; Feed the panda, organize the gardens, and grow bamboo in a specific way. The twist is, if someone else completes your request for you, you can cash in on their hard work. Or if you suspect someone is trying to complete a specific request, you can throw a monkey wrench into their plans.

It's a pretty chill game, great for families. Its great with all player counts (2-4) The competitive elements are very light. Fantastic icebreaker game.

Collector's edition takes up quite a bit of space on the table but looks great once you're into it. Simple rules but quite enjoyable.

Gardener is trying to tend his garden and grow bamboo while the panda runs around eating the bamboo. Try to gain the emperors favor by trimming down bamboo or laying out tiles in specific patterns.

Just watch out for the collectors edition weather dice, it's a little unwieldly and could possibly do some damage due to it's size, highly recommend using a dice try to roll it or any other soft surface.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (April 2013)

I was pleasantly surprised by the game. A lot of gamer friends said to me that I would not like Takenoko, so I was expecting a bad game but it wasn’t the case. The game is gorgeous and pretty simple. It can be taught under 10 minutes. The game components are also very good.

The gameplay is pretty decent, however I’m a little worried about the game balance due to the cards. I feel they add a lot of luck to the game. Still as it is a light (and quick) gateway game I don´t care much. However I’m rating Takenoko a 5.5 due to the luck of the draw in the cards.

Bottom line, Takenoko is a game I would play again but not one I would like to own (although my girlfriend loves it). Perfect for families or to introduce new people to our beloved hobby :).

Attractively produced lightweight Euro, with fun gameplay. After a game or two I'd recommend the variant that prevents the re-scoring of cards (tile combos in particular, the gardener and panda cards are ok) that have already been scored, as otherwise it can be too much of a luck-fest with players just drawing score cards (especially the tile cards) in the late game hoping to re-score tile combos in play that have already been scored.

After taking a two year hiatus from the game, returning to it has made for a much better experience.  Being one of the first games I played when coming into the modern era of gaming, it was a lot to take on at the time.  However, after a couple of years of playing through more advanced games, Takenoko is simple and just plain fun.  The mechanics feel right and work well and the game grows and moves beautifully.  Wonderful, thought-filled game.

Cute little game with little cards...ugh.  Well so does Rebellion, so oh well.  The game itself for me is probably about a 7 on it's own.  It's a fun race to the finish that new/non gamers seem to enjoy, which boosts it up .5 for me.  How pretty it looks while being played is worth another .5 star.  One thing that really makes playing this rewarding for me is that when I bought this, I paid over market value because the owner of the FLGS and his Uber driver were killed in a hit and run the same week and they were doing a fundraiser.  It also gets more enjoyable with every play, which is a rarity.

Mediocre game. Not too much involved in it, I don't really see opportunity for solid plays or strategy. The most you can do is aim for the optimal scoring card categories based on the strategies of other players, but even then there is luck of the draw.

This is one of our go-to favorites. It's simple enough to be played when you don't feel like thinking hard, complex enough to keep it interesting, and cute enough to keep you squealing. It's a game where you are completing secret goals and building a world one tile at a time with other people who also have secret goals. Goals include either building a certain color tile combination, eating a certain color bamboo combination, or growing a certain color bamboo combination. It's very fun and the expansion added a lot of really interesting game tiles to the mix. Great game.

Oh Takenoko how much I want to love you... but alas it cannot be. I will start out by saying that the game is absolutely gorgeous. The components are of the best quality and the game looks great on the table once you are done playing it. The main problem I have is that it is absolutely and completely random to the point where I feel as if there is not point in playing it because the winner is arbitrary anyways. You can pick up a card that is almost complete and score 6 points or you can spend 4 turns working on a card that is worth 3 points. Still, I know that this game has a following as it is so highly rated and at least it is done quickly so that's a plus right? Buyer beware!

This was a disappointment. The goal card mechanism sucks the enjoyment out of the game. Getting the right cards is decisive. The proposed expert variant that already completed cards just drawn have to be discarded is clunky and only diverts the issue to getting goal cards needing a single step to completion. The die roll before each turn is another letdown potentially giving 50% more actions or nothing useful.
Too bad as everything else entices to play. I like the Asian-inspired artwork, the figurines are cute, the topic is pleasant. I'm surprised that Takenoko is so successful.

Like many Matagot games, the bits are of high quality and helps to improve the playing experience. The game itself occupies that awkward space where it's too complicated to play with kids, but not necessarily offering enough choice or challenge for regular play with adults.

The main problem is with the cards, which seem highly imbalanced. The eating cards are so easy to complete and yield the most points, while the plot cards are the hardest and offer the least points. I'd like to experiment more with these cards to see if I'm wrong about this.

The panda is very adorable. I think this is an accessible and pleasant game that makes it a perfect gateway. However, the rules wasn't as simple to teach to a non-gamer as I thought it would be, thus defeating the purpose. Also, the scoring is not balanced.

Ultimately, I could not get over the scoring flaws and I sold it

On the top of my favorite games list! Super-nice, sooo enjoyable to play, tense and relaxing at the same time, it has great replayability, there is always much going on on the board since every move of the others can affect you, great even with two players. And what happens if the panda eats a piece you would otherwise need? Nothing! You will not be worked up! She is so cute, and she was hungry...

Awesome, perfect, it has everything we wish from a boardgame. 
Simply love it! I can not praise it enough. Thank you for this game!

Very good game. Even for introducing new people.

I should have rated it a 7... but there can be a lot of take-that that just... doesn't feel in the spirit of the game?

So your objective is depending on your cards. Cultivate certain bamboo strains in your garden in a certain configuration. Have the panda eat a certain mix of bamboo. Or have bamboo sprouts form a pleasing configuration...
You do this by performing two different actions each turn, with a die added to mix this up a bit.

In this game you're building a garden and growing bamboo but also feeding a panda who eats the bamboo.  You each have different cards with VP conditions so you're trying to manipulate the garden to satisfy those conditions to score VP.  When a player has scored 7 cards the game ends and the other players will have one chance to beat the score.

Players take turns building out the emperor's garden in a way that gives them the most points. Place tiles, making the correct combinations, grow bamboo, and use a panda to accomplish your goals. This game has great artwork and components, a fun whimsy style, and clever mechanics.

The panda miniature is so cute that this game lures people in with bright colors and artwork. The gameplay is fast and accomplishing objectives feel really good. The base game skews towards panda objectives so using the variant from the expansion by awarding 3 more points for sets of objectives really fixes things. Great gateway game to play with casuals.

Played with 4.  A lot of fun but end game lucky card draws make it less strategic.  Some call this a "medium weight euro" which is baffling.  It's feather light, lighter than Bauza's 7 Wonders but plays longer.

A kivitelezés gyönyörű, hangulatos, átlagon felüli. Ebben legalább többnyire mindenki egyetért. Azt viszont kicsit furcsállom, hogy sokan ennyire fújnak a feladatkártyákra egy ilyen jellegű játékban (miközben a TtR-ban meg megtalálják a stratégiai mélységeket). Szerintem alap, hogy a már teljesített kártyát visszarakjuk és újat húzunk helyette, illetve a játék végén jár a +3 pont a 3 különböző cél teljesítéséért. Nálunk ez elég ösztönzés arra, hogy ne csak kajáljon a panda.
De gondolom ha meg bonyolultabb, összetetteb feladatok lennének, akkor meg az lenne a baj, szóval rendben van ez így, aki egy ilyen rövid, könnyed társasban is fúj a kártyákra, az inkább ne játsszon vele és kész. :)

Maga a játékmechanikai összetétel kiváló szerintem, tetszik, hogy nincs semmi sajátod (csak a megevett bambuszok és a kártyák), így a tábla történéseit közösen alakítjuk. Kettesben ez tervezhetőbb, négyesben kevésbé, de azért az is legyen egyértelmű, hogy a Takenoko nem az agytekervények szétégetéséről szól, hanem az igazán kellemes, mégis tartalmas szórakozásról. Remek darab!

An absolutely charming game where a panda runs around a bamboo garden and devours all of the bamboo. While still a competitive game, Takenoko never feels super cutthroat. Sometimes another player will take an action that interferes with what you wanted to do, but there's always other actions to take and other ways to accrue points. I'm never disappointed when this game hits the table, and everyone always thoroughly enjoys the experience, win or lose.

Rating could go up.  The thing I hated most about the game was the oddly tall shaped box that didn't fit on shelves with any normal games.  Now I have the newer edition and it's now shorter than most other games lol.

Given to my daughter, who really enjoys it. :)

This little panda has won a special place at my gaming table. This gorgeous little game has beautiful components (though the cards are a little flimsy, you just use them for scoring), a clear, entertaining and educational rulebook, and plenty of fun and fast-paced gameplay. I play this as a family game, and it is quite competitive! The cooperative building of the map you all share, plus your mutual manipulation of the panda and gardener make it interactive without being cut-throat. I do have two complaints, though. Since the cards vary so much in value, bad draws can easily cost you the game. And because these cards are kept secret, it's impossible to interfere with another player's strategy. This makes it much better suited as a family game than it is a strategy game.

RATING: 9
I wanted to give this a 10. There is SO MUCH going right with this game: depth of strategy, neat theme, quick play.

The one reason I cannot rate this 10 for 10 are the relative variance in how the game can play out too quickly for one player if they push some tile laying strategies and get the right tile VP cards.  I think this strategy is easily mitigated with savvy players, but the rush strategy can be a little warping.

I like the amount of normal variance in the game, and I love the end game visual appeal, much like carcassonne, it's a beautiful game to play and to finish.

I don't mind luck. I think luck is a fine thing, but there has to be some balance. There are a lot of layers of luck in this game. Luck of the roll, luck of the draw, and luck of the draw again. You do get to pick some actions, but 40% of them are completely out of your hands. The decisions you get to make in this game are overshadowed. Bauza could've struck a better harmony between skill and luck in this game. At least the artwork is phenomenal. This game makes me a sad panda.

It's like a stray cat in the neighborhood. It comes around and you don't like it and you don't want it near you..but eventually your will is bent and it becomes not quite beloved but you'll feed it and pet it..give it a nickname..usually something trashy because it's a stray after all. It isn't allowed in but the relationship is fine....when it doesn't show up anymore you are not that heartbroken. Takenoko is my stray cat....

I got this game for my birthday in 2016. I really liked the pictures and videos of it, that I had seen on the web. The artwork is just beautiful. I was hoping for this to be a great family game to play with my relatives and with children, but after introducing it to a few people, it turned out it was actually slightly hard to grasp for some of them. I still think it makes for a decent introductory game, but it certainly isn't for everyone. While I love the look of the game, I wish the panda and gardener figures were a little bigger, since they're tiny. The gameplay is fun, but the complexity is at a strange level for me. Too light for my gamer friends. but too heavy for many non gamers I know. So unfortunately it doesn't see as much play as I had hoped for. I guess it will be a "next step game" for some non gamers I play with.

In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game.

RATING: 7
► Best family game.

[b]Takenoko[/b] works wonderfully as a family game: cute theme, fantastic components, easy rules, great iconography (making it language-independent), it's shining with colour and has a very low level of competition.

It arguably also works as a next step beyond the usual gateway games for newcomers to the hobby -- and my rating is based on exactly these aspects.

For seasoned board game fans, [b]Takenoko[/b] can still be a nice relaxing experience from time to time, because of the mentioned qualities this game has, but it can also completely fall flat if players are looking for a game with real depth.

The main reason [b]Takenoko[/b] plays like a nice low-competitive game is, that the objective cards from other players are hidden, which means that players will only take their turns for themselves without actually knowing if they are helping their opponents.

This adds a not to underestimate level of luck to the game, and surprisingly often the person I explained this game to actually won without really knowing what they were doing.

Still, I'm rating this game for what it is and wants to be: a nice and cute family game.

I think this game is just okay, but my bestie loves it.  I think i'd like this more if I started playing more aggressively and guessing what my opponent is going for and blocking them.  My gripe is it's very easy to win this game by ignoring tile placement goals and going for panda and growing.  You can quickly get up to the number of goals required to finish the game and leave your opponent in the dust unless your opponent is doing the same.

Less balanced than it should be (cards!!!). Otherwise it's a beautiful little game that is simply made a lot better by its look than it would be otherwise. A little bit fiddly/complex for what it is (it's a very light family gateway) but the look alone makes me want to keep it to be able to play it with the kids later.

The presentation is very nice and the theme is well supported. Other than that I'm not at all sure what the appeal stem from. The gameplay is very shallow, where opportunities primarily come from your opponents by accident.

I can see it work in a more social group where gameplay is secondary as there's lots of room for idle chatter, but it's 'functional' at best.

There's a tad too many minor rule details (also of the kind where, in the rules, you have to search for among the examples - which I loathe). While the rules are mostly logical with regards to theme, it's not at all intuitive. Which is a remarkable combo, really.

Oh, and it's a no-no for the colourblind amongst us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very light boardgames with nice bright board and bits.  The goal card are not valued particularly well and there's a ton of randomness in getting the right ones.  The dice certainly adds even more randomness.  In the game I played, the winner won by pulling 2 random goals which happened to be already completed (board layout) worth 8 pts (on a final score of 36) in the final round.  Still, it's fast and it flows well enough that it's pleasant to play, just don't have any expectation of skill determining outcome.

RATING: 6
Panda figure & pastel colored bamboo - so I had to have it! A family game, but can also be played strategicly with gamers. You plant the royal gardens with bamboo, the gardener tends to the bamboo and the panda eats it. The game is to find patterns in the garden that corresponds to your secret missions (drawn face down). When you mission it completed you show your card and score point. Number of missions depend upon the number of players. 

Edit: There's a problem with the scoring system if you ask me. I will try to fix it and get back.

After a video review: Seems like a light tactical abstract game playable by non gamers.

It's a bit weird thematically that you share the control of the Panda and the gardener.

There is colorblindness issues.

This is an enjoyable light game with some beautiful bits.  There is a fair bit of luck, but in this short a game, I'm not certain it matters a great deal.  This is one of those games I feel like is not my type of game, but I just have fun when I play...

RATING: 5
Visually a feast, but as a game it did not work for me. Players are constantly in each others way when trying to complete their objective cards. One moment you think you've completed an objective, the next a player ruins it for you. Too unpredictable, too chaotic and just plain annoying. Having said that, eveyone I played this with loved it. I didn't so it's no longer part of my collection.

Let's get it out of the way: this game is gorgeous. Absolutely wonderful components that make the game look great during play. The game itself? Not bad. It's very light and quick, and that's fine. The only issue I have is that the points scored for achieving objectives seem really skewed. Some really tough objectives give few points while easier ones give lots. So that's weird, but not a game killer for me.

RATING: 6
A good light game with a great theme and art. The action choices and the weather meld really well with the theme, and this game manages to combine a bunch of mechanics in small quantities (action point allowance, set collection, grid movement, etc.) without any of them feeling tacked on or clunky. 

In regards to the goal cards: metagaming the goal cards I think features too prominently in this game, and I wish there were more variety of goals in general. Also, the non-Panda goal cards outside your first batch are really luck-based, as someone might be able to score a large amount of points with little effort if the board is in their favor, while someone else might obtain one that is near impossible to achieve. However, one thing I liked of how the goals they were implemented was the maximum hand size so you can't just hoard a ton of goal cards and wait till the last half of the game to complete all of them.

Despite the fact that I have come around to the fact that this isn't the objectively best game, I still love it when I play. It's actually one of my more favorite solo games because I've been sandboxing a huge variety of solo variants, from adapting ones that I've found on other parts of the site to creating my own (You vs the Panda and You vs the Gardner). I've even gone through a few options for a two player game that's the Panda vs the Gardner. I love the theme and the art. So, yeah. I feel that I do have this game almost "solved", but I still get a ton of enjoyment out of it every time I play.

This game is a joy to play. It is beautiful, colorful, fun, has nice components and enough strategy to feel satisfying but not overly complex as to be prohibitive in getting it on the table.

Pretty game.  Fun, but it seems that the panda eating bamboo strategy dominates, which means that you don't get to build up a lot of bamboo and limits decisions.  We play that you can only score two panda cards (except with kids we let them score unlimited to handicap us).

Takenoko is a simple set collection game where you are trying to make various sets.  You are either trying to get certain garden tiles irrigated, bamboo to grow in particular configuration or have your panda each certain kinds of bamboo.  On your turn you have two actions and a bonus action that is determined randomly with a dice roll.  

This is a very cute game.  It is possibly more luck based, but it is intended for younger kids but it is great for gamers too.  I love the game and play it with the family a good bit.

RATING: 7.5
Durata 60 minuti, basato sulla risoluzione di carte obiettivo.
Nel proprio turno è possibile coltivare i terreni, far crescere il bambù, farlo mangiare al panda ed altre azioni.
Le carte obiettivo si completano formando una determinata composizione di terreni dei diversi colori, raggiungendo determinate altezze delle piante di bambù o di pezzi mangiati dal panda.
Molto adatto ai neofiti.

Beautiful looking, fast, quite light game. The game is about filling different Objectives and each turn you have 2 or 3 actions depending on the Event die result. Luck seems to have a little too big impact in the form of Objective cards as their difficulty vary depending on the board state and what Objectives other players are trying to achieve. Skilled players can try to mitigate bad luck though. Each turn is a fun little puzzle until your luck turns against you and you can't really do anything.

My wife and I played this with another couple. The couple got this for the holidays and were eager to try it out. The couples 3 year old would pop up every 10 min. wanting to see what was going on and I'd play with him for a bit until it was my turn. By the end I was so board I would just do my turn as quickly as possible and then go watch The Incredibles with the 3 year old in the other room. Towards the end of the game one of the adults came in and told me I won.

I was never invested in the game and I never tried to interact with the other players. Somehow I won without even trying. Sitting in a room and watching The Incredibles with a 3 year old was for more enjoyable.

Nice to look at, but it may be a little too random for me to enjoy playing very often.  I don't like that I'm pretty much hoping for a certain roll on the weather die to pull off a good move (e.g. If I can roll for rain, then I can make the 1 pink bamboo grow to 2 high.  I can then move the gardener to the other 2 pink bamboo space and it'll grow both pinks to 3 high and I can complete my gardener card for having 2 pink bamboos at exactly 3 high).  Not the kind of luck I enjoy in games.  It also feels a little unbalanced.  It does play quickly and can be taught to anybody.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The easiest way to get points is to fulfill the panda objectives. So first nothing can grow because everybody eats everything that's possible. When all panda objectives are out there's the chance to fulfill the gardener objectives. 
I can't understand the hype, there's nothing interesting in the game, but a lot of luck.

Bought this to play as one of my first ventures into the gaming hobby, after watching it played on TableTop. It is fun, but not one I want to play too often after learning more about the board game hobby.  It is a good game to play with people who don't know much more about board gaming than Monopoly and Uno though, and it's "cute" aspect makes it great for playing with kids.  I expect that if my kids ever decide to get a move on and give me grands, it will get lots of use!!

I don't really like this game. The gameplay, to me, seems to hang together by a thread. A thread so fragile that any serious experience of playing other games will break, and the game will just seem like a dislocated pile of game mechanics and actions. But ....

... my kids (the two younger ones) absolutely love it! They take great glee in moving the panda and eating my bamboo. They take great glee in being able to choose which one of the extra actions they perform after a dice role. They just enjoy every bit of it. I play it for them. For me it just doesn't sit as a comprehensive game. But I admit it does look very nice on the table.

I haven't tried playing with the variation rules whereby you get 3 points for every set of completed task cards you have (1 tile pattern, 1 bamboo collection and 1 pattern of growing bamboo). This may change it up and improve it as you are forced to go for a variety of cards during the game and not just the tile patterns which seem far easier to match and collect.

I also don't like the fact that often many cards are already or almost complete when you draw them. I do like playing you just discard these but the kids don't. Also the English rule book mentions when taking the tile action you draw three tiles and choose one and place the other two back on the top. This slows down the tile draw and on rare occasions the whole game as no-one gets what they want. We switched to playing you put them back on the bottom of the pile so you get through the tiles quicker.

I am sorry to say this is not one for me. I will trade it as soon as the kids show no interest in playing it!

RATING: 7
Enjoyed it. Multiple plays reveal that some strategies are better than others, but with enough game sense you can take advantage of your opponents when they all try to go for i.e. the gardener objectives. There's also quite a bit of luck involved, since you have to roll the weather die, which has a 33,33% chance of being what you want, about the same chance for the land plots to be what you want and finally getting that right objective card. So 3 out of 6 actions are almost wholly reliant on luck, which might be too much for some, but it's actually nice to have luck in games to even the playground between strategic hobbyists and casual players. If Takenoko had no luck element to it, you could say it's basically a retheme of something like Splendor. But I'm glad it's not.

Would love to play this with those strategic-minded hobbyists and see if it's worthy of more stars.

After 10 plays it seems that there are not much decisions involved or maybe that the decisions are a little bit boring and with not much that of an impact. The player interaction is somehow annoying and not the kind that I like.

Anyway is probable that I'll keep this game, as seems that the more casual gamers in my family like it and is pretty much harmless. But as soon as it begins to take some dust in the shelf, I'll sell it with no regrets.

The king of light games for me continues to be Ticket to Ride.

Funny theme but a little dull in the end. Don't like these games where you only score hidden objectives based on some sort of pattern, it requires memorizing the possible cards to play well and a lot of random "o guess I helped you". 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's an decent starter game but after half a dozen plays, I can see the game wearing out it's welcome.  There isn't much strategy involved and the tactics are rather limiting.  After you've played a few games, there isn't exactly that much else to see or do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Beautifully designed game. Also the game mechanism (growing bamboo before it gets eaten by the panda) is innovative and fun. Good gateway game for non-gamers. Yet, unfortunately there's quite a lot of luck involved in drawing the right score cards near the end of the game. To avoid this, it might be useful to play the variant rule that says if you draw a card and the condition is already met you should discard it and draw another one.

Excellent to play with younger children, the game mechanics are very intuitive.

Solid.  Fun.  Fairly simple to learn.  Has a "Ticket to Ride" feel but more fun. C'mon, it has a cute little panda!  Worth buying!  Components?  My tiles were super tough to punch out.  Had to use an blade to cut them out.  Contacted customer service about damage to a few tiles but have heard nothing.

For a gateway game, this destroys Catan. For experienced players it's best to play with the advanced rule that says if you draw an objective card, which has already been completed, you must discard it and draw another. If you don't, the endgame turns into who can get a lucky draw that's already completed.

Pretty and nice enough, but scoring is too wonky to support its pseudo-euro trappings. I could accept the lack of balance if the game was a bit shorter.

RATING: 7.97
Game quality: Maybe thee gateway game for me as of now. The visual aspect of it and the ease of play makes it an easy draw and quick to learn game.

The downside is there's not a ton of depth here, and it isn't like it is all that ground breaking. It just works, and that's enough. 7.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: An easy yes. This has already led to one couple buying a copy and I can see this working well a number of times over. 9.

Do I want to play this if asked: Very much so. I think it will have to be in the 15-20 plays area before I slow down and there is an expansion coming so long term I see many plays of this. 7.

Overall: 7.97.

Rating Potential: Might go slightly lower in terms of desire to play but that's about it.

Not color blind friendly (even though it would be very easy to add symbols to colors). In fact, it is enemy of color blind people (you shouldn't even try to play). Also, the goal cards have confusing rules for first time players (on the X that define some aditional rules to complete goals).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn and quick to play, with super-cute theme. Women will love it, as will men with a taste for peaceful, non-confrontational and relaxed game environment.

You pick cards from three categories of goals (shaping the garden, growing bamboos, eating bamboos) and try to do the right combos to score the points.

The panda and the gardener are moved collectively in a competition to have them do what each player needs in order to complete the goals.

If it lasted longer it would probably become a bit boring, but for a fast match it's just got what it takes to be fun. It's all about balancing your chances, maybe there's too much luck related to the die regulating the weather conditions, but not enough to spoil meaningful play.

Each player kind of plays independently, because one hardly gets enough information about the competitors' aims to make it reasonable to waste your moves to impede them. Nevertheless, the cunning player will choose moves that shrink the tree of possibilities for the following players whenever there's an opportunity to do so.


UPDATE:

I've been playing this game for years and it's still interesting. When we are two players and we don't have much time, it's almost always our first choice. I'm raising my rating because I like it even more now and I feel I underestimated its depth.

The fact that you can pick the category of your next goals and even choose which goals you want to pursue or ignore allows for a lot of more planning than I initially realised. Different goals have a different value in victory points and you can cleverly combine them to reach them faster or lower your risks. For example, if you know that you are likely to need eating some bamboo segments to shape the garden in the way prescribed by a high-value "gardener" goal, you can pick a "panda" goal (they usually have a lower average value) and exploit the pursuit of the first goal to make some progress in the pursuit of the second one.

Moreover, the differences in the average difficulty and value of each category of goals means that you have to keep an eye on your competitors more than I did in my first matches: the game can become a rush to goal completion or proceed slowly towards tougher and more rewarding goals and you must pay attention or you'll get it wrong.

So, this is the first game that I have to rate on two different areas. 1) the game components - WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! This game is perfection. The box is lovely and the insert fits everything snugly. The tiles are beautiful, thick and chunky sized. The bamboo is colorful, amazing quality, and fit together perfectly. The cards are adequate and easy to distinguish. The panda and the farmer?! Seriously, these could not be cuter or well made. Just a lovely game.
2) The game - It's more zen than game. The game comes down to luck of the draw. Your opponent's objective cards are secret, so there really is no way to stop them scoring (unless you can guess what they are trying to do; difficult at best as the objective cards are so quick to accomplish). This game isn't just luck driven; it really does just plays itself. You just build a garden, albeit a beautiful one, draw some objective cards, and hopefully you win!
Usually, I would really dislike a game like this. However, it is really a relaxing experience. I could see this being loved by kids, very, very non-gamers, and gamers just wanting to play filler to completely chill-out. This is game is like appreciating a traditional Chinese garden (which the games artwork mimics well).

There's a decent game somewhere, I'm sure about it, but the severe amount of cuteness crammed inside the box exceeds the critical mass. Anyone I've played the game with (including myself) was rendered to a babbling half-wit, playing with the dolls or making pooping noises upon completing panda objectives. Sad really. The presentation is just so delightful, it overshadows the game itself. Worths its price, for the wrong reasons though.

This quickly jumped up on my list of favorites, especially as a family/casual game.  The components look fantastic and add a fun "toy" factor, the strategy is clever and interactive, and the theme is very appealing.  There are a good number of fiddly rules when first teaching, but once the game gets going it's not too bad.  There's also a decent luck factor in the objective cards and how the board plays out, but you need to complete enough cards that this shouldn't be a big problem.  I also love that the game consistently plays in about 45 minutes.

Also another nice gateway game. I think I would prefer to use this to teach non-gamers to play board games instead of Settlers of Catan (even if that's the game that got me into the hobby).

Instead of a roll of dice, the luck here is mitigated in the deck of cards, which isn't horrendous because you shape the board to the card you pick up. You aren't a slave to randomization.

Its a hard one to sell to people, but its certainly a fun game.  Just avoid trying to tell people that "its a game with a cute little panda who eats bamboo".  Not a way to get adult males on board, but my 10 year old thought it was great.  Just a follow up that now that I finally got people playing they like it...despite the hungry little panda

First game we didn't play with the advanced variant where you discard an objective card if the current state of the game will complete the objective. Made the game finish more quickly. Two players seems like multi-player solitaire. Would like to play with more.

Gave this as a Christmas present to my nieces, one which always wants to play games and the other who has to be in the right mood to play it and isn't that keen on that many games - and they both absolutely loved it. I did, too, in fact I was strongly tempted to buy my own copy afterwards despite having decided to let this game be something I could play with them.

The game looks stunning, everything's nicely detailed and colourful, especially the panda and gardener miniatures. You really get the visual of a magnificent bamboo garden as you play.

The game's easy enough to get into, has a nice luck to strategy ratio and is engaging for both kids and adults to play. Absolutely recommend it.

RATING: 7
The game itself is sweet and soothing (excitement hounds look elsewhere), but this comment is mainly to point out an unexpected side benefit of the game pieces. It is incredibly calming and oddly addictive to just spend time stacking the bamboo pieces into the highest tower possible. The record so far is 10. Replay value of this side-bamboo-tower stacking game is extremely high and the bamboo-stacker is left in a zen state. 10/10 on this count.

Charming wee game that's fun to play light heartedly with the ones you love.

Ultimately, the winner is most likely to be decided based upon other factors rather than a player's own decision making. What cards you draw, what the die lands on and what your opponents do matters more that what you do.

It is what it is - so lots of charm, luck and chaos - perfect for it's target audience (Gateway weight Gamers and families). Everyone else would be best to avoid it in favour of less charming games.

It's almost as basic as good Eurogames come, but it's a great Eurogame! For such a simple game, it captivates your interest way more than you'd think.

I must admit I had to be persuaded to play Takenoko, it just did not look like my type of game, but looks can be deceiving. It is a relatively short game, not a "filler" but at the same time it does not hit that wall of "this is taking too long". I am a player who does not, on average, tolerate a game lasting more than an hour or at most an hour and a half, however in the cases of these games going long (which is not usual) I still don't get that restless feeling. This is a GREAT gateway game and I even play with my 8 year old, but at the same time my eldest son, 16 yr old, loves playing too. It is a good strategy game with some good visuals and tactics. TRY IT! 8/10

Very nice components, but I don't see much beyond that. Dice rolls determine which of the unbalanced bonus options you get. There's a modicum of strategy in drawing cards as much as possible to maximize your point-scoring options early, but the hand limit cuts this off quickly, and once the board develops, the card draws result in ridiculous swings in points at the end of the game. Ultimately, it's following instructions and hoping to get lucky; I don't see much "game" here.

NOTE: I think we missed the rule about discarding mission cards that are already fulfilled upon drawing them. That makes the endgame swings less likely, so I might be willing to try this again.

RATING: 8
Takenoko is a wonderful light strategy game.  It has a reputation for being too random (with regard to randomly drawn objectives), but this is actually a learning-curve problem.  If inexperienced players start indiscriminately growing bamboo, the balance gets thrown off and the game becomes about who has the best objective cards.  If players are strategic about panda placement and bamboo growth, the game is interesting & tense. Growing Bamboo is like choosing craftsman in Puerto Rico.

Hiányzott belőle nekem a "kinyomkodós" lapok közül a kezdő lapot tartalmazó (illetve kettő volt egy másikból). Miután megérkeztek az alkatrészek, rögtön 3 partit is lenyomtunk! Erre még én is azt kell, hogy mondjam, cuki! :) Jó ránézni, minden darabja álomszép!
A játék maga pörgős 30 perc alatt nagyon simán lemegy egy parti. Az eddigi 3 játszma mind 2 fős volt, és ugyan érezhetően számít a taktika is, azért a szerencse itt az úr. Ha úgy jönnek a lapok (rosszak/kevés pontosak) esélyed sincs. De az az igazság, hogy ebben a játékban ez nem igazán zavar!
Kíváncsi vagyok milyen többen!
Ja, és aki nem ad ki hangokat játék közben, az rosszul játssza!! :)

Minden nap előkerül azóta, és többet is játszunk vele, immár 3-an is próbáltuk. Rendkívül élvezetes, könnyed, aranyos, de a rossz lapjárás bosszantó tud lenni, ezért nem növelek a 8 ponton. (Volt, hogy nem húztam 4-esnél értékesebb lapot, így hiába igyekeztem a befejezéssel, a 9 lapom összértéke (bónusszal együtt) kevesebb lett mint ellenfelem pontjai 5 lapból!!!)
A panda egy haspók!:)

20+ játék során az említett eset kivételével mindig én nyertem! (ill. volt egy döntetlen 3 játékosnál) A szerencse tehát bár meghatározó, ügyes taktikával ki lehet játszani! Vagy állandóan szerencsém van... :P

Takenoko hat nicht nur eine super niedliche Aufmachung und tolles Spielmaterial, dahinter versteckt sich auch noch ein richtig schönes Familienspiel.

So wird Takenoko auch für Vielspieler und Strategen nicht langweillig und bietet eine willkommene Abwechslung zu großen, strategischen Schwergewichten.

A solid, lighter game that's very appealing. Plays out similarly each time, which is why it isn't rated higher, but it's still very easy to get people into. My one real complaint is that I think the gardener scoring cards are much more difficult to pull off than the other two, so going that route seems to be putting yourself at a disadvantage. Still, games of this always end up being pretty close, so it does come off as a well-designed game. Just not one that has a lot of depth.

Just be careful: underneath the cuddly theme there is a good strategy and planing game. There are some way to easy methods of gaining points in the late game (which might need some houserules) but taking care of the Panda needs quite a bit of planing and thinking.

Place tiles and move figures (a gardener to plant bamboo and a panda to eat the same) on a common board to accomplish hidden objectives. The fact that the objectives are hidden means that whoever is lucky to draw the right objectives or have the other players unintentionally fulfill them wins. OK family game I guess but not much else.

To start with this game has an AMAZING table presence. Between the theme and the bits the game starts selling itself before you even start playing. Laying out the tiles to create the garden, growing the bamboo, moving the panda and the gardener, and putting out the irrigation are all steps that are engaging and that people grasp really quickly in my experience.

I really enjoy this light family game. It is fast-paced and doesn't cause too much AP in players. In addition, the game introduces the concept of hidden objectives which is something a lot of non-gamers aren't familiar with outside of those who remember Careers so it is a nice building block to future games. 

One negative is that it can feel somewhat unbalanced with regards to the objective cards. The Plot objectives do not seem to reward on par with the gardener cards for the amount of effort expended. Knowing that the gardener cards have higher scores is an advantage. I think the variant for objective cards could help fix the "lucky draw" problem.

As part of the Imperial court, players first roll dice to determine the weather which gives them a bonus (take another action or an improvement tile). Players can choose to expand the garden, irrigate a plot, move the gardener, move the panda or draw a bonus card.  Players are trying to score points through their secret bonus cards by fulfilling the conditions on the card. Bonus cards are matching the colored plots, having the panda consume the right colors or having certain configurations of bamboo.

There is luck in what you roll and the bonus cards you draw. It's fun, and more in the filler category. I enjoy playing it and the components are nice. There is a racing element and there are tough decisions to make.  Looking forward to more plays.

This game not only looks gorgeous and easy to set up and taken down but it's also easy to teach, easy to learn and a joy to play. It plays like a light, well made Euro game but with the stronger components and more lighthearted look and feel, plus the addition of the die, it doesn't suffer from the dryness that many euro games of this weight have. In terms of constant replayability--it's debatable if this is something you'd want to play each and every week (though I don't think it has bad replayability as there are clearly layers of depth and strategy)

This game is a real winner and even the inlay works really well--almost as well as Jamaica. Having the 3d stacking bamboo and painted minis is great and the choice of a bright and happy aesthetic is perfect. I use the mists of Pandaria soundtrack while playing this game. 

I recommend it for people who like light and family friendly games 1-4, easy/introductory Euro games, or games that are easy to play and show non gamers (old people, young people, lame people)

I really enjoy Takenoko because the board expands up as well as outwards, it involves setting up scenarios to collect points, it has a variety of actions one can take each turn, the theme is fun with cute miniatures and cards, and it involves a little luck, but not all luck.

My friends don't like this game because they think it has too much luck, but I enjoy being dealt a "hand" (In this game, it would be your hand of objectives and your dice rolls on your turns) and finding the best combos possible from what comes up. I could see how this game would be frustrating if you had a series of bad dice rolls (like in Machi Koro if you've ever played that), but I think the second phase of the turn is enough to mitigate that for me.

"Takenoko" was a gift, and while we had seen it around, we never really looked too deeply at it. So far just Matt and I have played so we still need to see how it works with 3-4 players, but it feels like it would be just as fun.

Here goes our rating (1= disappointed, 3=hit&miss, 5= owned it!)

1. Originality - 4 - Concept wise I have never seen a storyline like it, not that I've seen every game ever, but it's definitely new in our collection. It does have a little Catan feel to it, but in a good way. I believe that the Catan feel will make it much easier to introduce to new and emerging gamers; and unlike Catan, "Takenoko" is meant to play well with just 2 players.

2. Artwork - 4 - It's cute, and the comic strip in the instructions really sets the tone for the game so everything feels like it fits together. 

3. Quality of Contents - 4 - In the box you will find that everything has it's place, but there's also some wriggle room if you would rather keep some tokens in the baggy. There's enough baggies for everything in the game, we just added elastics for the cards. The Gardner and the Panda are beautifully designed and don't feel flimsy, then again we don't have children so who knows what the lifespan of these figures will really be. Cards curve super easily and were curved fresh out of the box. Since we tend to do the elastic method instead of card sleeves - yes, we're horrible people - I'm not too concerned about this as our best-loved games tend to have the same issue.

4. Storyline - 5 - Love it. The comic strip sets up the story, giving you some background as to why this panda is roaming around with a gardner in bamboo fields, and it really adds personality to the pieces as you decide to move either figure.

5. Playthrough - 5 - Super easy and intuitive. In fact, it flows so well that we tend to forget to place our markers on the actions we took because we just moved through them so fluidly and are snatching the weather die from one another. We get serious about our bamboo!

6. Instructions - 4 - I learned the game from only using the instruction booklet. Everything fell into place once we got things set up and moving around. The only thing is that there are a few extra tiles that are not mentioned and our first run through we were concerned about how they might factor in. Pretty sure that they don't, it was just for even printing.

7. Replayability - 5- For a quick, simple, and mildly competitive game, I don't see why we wouldn't keep this game as a regular. It's not as intense as "King of Tokyo" by any means, but feels more social than "Carcassonne". 
	
8. Two player - 5- We've only played it two player so far and it works great.

9. Large Group N/A - max number is 4, but it feels like it would be just as smooth a game as two player.

10. Fun Factor - 4 - Overall I really do like the game, but for me personally, it doesn't get me jumping into "again, again!" mode. One game of "Takenoko" is all I need for one night. I do recommend it and will be introducing the game to friends, it's just not sitting on my "all-time favourite" shelf quite yet.

Great family game, but I suspect that the very cute theme and pieces are a HUGE part of the appeal. There are some balance issues - not terrible, but noticeable - and the game doesn't feel all that strategic. It's still enjoyable though, just don't take it too seriously.

My daughter loves this game and rates it a 10. It's not a game I would actively pull out for myself, but am always happy to play with friends or family.

A truly beautiful game about the emperor's bamboo gardener frustrated by the grazing of the emperor's new pet Panda.

Absolutely fantastic components give Takenoko great visual appeal and draws players into the game's theme.

There is basically no player contention in Takenoko, one need only focus on their current turn and not each others. The feel of playing Takenoko is relaxing, peaceful, laid-back: Zen.

Some of the objective cards aren't balanced at all. Oh, and be sure to play with the Advanced Variant rules.

After several plays I've come to realize that, despite its gorgeous appearance, there just isn't enough game to Takenoko. Its look is all the appeal. The lack of player interaction and lack of strategy are the problem. Players are performing actions, but there isn't any fun. If Matagot, with their cool components, hadn't made it, but Rio Grande had, with their bare bones boring tiles, no one would care about Takenoko.

Takenoko is okay. Good for kids, but adults will start selling/trading it after a year when the sparkle wears off. Glad I didn't shell out the cash for the overpriced Collector's Edition.

Another plus is that it has a lot of replay value; I might even say that it is kind of addictive.

Takenoko tem um visual meio infantil, mas é muito divertido. A ideia básica é: o imperador ganhou um panda, e cabe ao jardineiro do palácio cuidar do bicho e do jardim ao mesmo tempo. Assim, cada jogador escolhe se vai fazer o panda comer bambu e fazer o jardineiro plantar ou podar as plantas. Fazendo isso, se cumpre objetivos. Jogo tranquilo para novatos, e recomendado para quem quer trazer aquela moça inocente pro hobby.

[i]This has been another hit with everyone in my house. It is also a great gateway game; my dad enjoys playing this with my kids which is awesome. I have to say it again, this is one of the most beautiful games we own, the board looks amazing by the end. I would highly recommend this to any family looking for a great game to play with their kids.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- This is by far the most beautiful game we own; I love looking at the board as we play with all the bamboo growing.
- The panda and farmer are really well painted minis.
- The game oozes charm; people will be drawn in because of the great components.
- Easy to learn rules (we do not play with any variants).

I believe this is an excellent family/gateway game with easy to pick up rules. Takenoko oozes charm; people will be drawn in because of the great components. This game does have some luck involved, but that is great for a family game that you are going to play with younger kids and more casual gamers.[/i]

This one really surprised me.  Got it because it is cute and I thought my wife would like to play it.  It is a really fun game and I am enjoying it more than I anticipated.  I would bring this to the table to entice a non-gamer to play.

Managed to get hold of the collector's edition as well. I find that playing with the collector's edition really adds to the eye candy; the only minor nit-pick is the size of the weather dice, I would have preferred it to be smaller.

FOR TRADE is the normal edition of Takenoko and NOT the collector's edition.

Played a game with the correct rules for scoring plot objective only for irrigated tiles, but upon reading FAQ, realised that still got the one where rotating a plot objective is allowed rule wrong. Nevertheless, it made for a really enjoyable time of optimizing one's moves. The hardest decisions were always when to take an objective card and which type to take.

Had a game with wife and 6 year old today. Enjoyed the multiple paths to victory and light-hearted nature of the game. Didn't understand if irrigation was actually necessary since most of the time we aimed for the hexes orientation cards vs the gardener ones. Would like to try with the advanced variant of not being able to auto-complete cards when drawn. (Oops, looks like we played the land tile objective wrongly. All the land tiles need to be irrigated before they can be scored.)

A beautiful and really wonderful to play edition of Takenoko. The large panda and gardner figures are so amazing and better designs than the original. The large bamboo pieces are also wonderful and all easily fit together. The wooden box and foam inserts really protect the game components well and with the sleeve the game looks lovely on the shelf too.

The tiles are cut a little oddly, I was assuming that they would have been cut accurately by machine but somehow they have uneven edges. It does not hinder game play at all, just a little less than perfect.

I am not sure why I keep getting Antoine Bauza games. I think the theme is the thing; no zombies or elves or farming. This game is perfectly pleasant, which I guess fits the theme; it does lack a bit of tension though. This is edging towards 'pastime'.

Beautiful components and artwork complements an elegant game that's both gamer and family accessible. You start with one of each of the three types of quest cards, which each have a condition you're trying to satisfy through the game to score points, be it eat 2 bamboo of a certain colour, grow a bamboo plant in a certain place or lay garden tiles in the configuration shown. Turns are a roll of the die which will generally earn you a bonus action, then take two actions - which you use to progress towards completing your quest cards if it looks like other people aren't going to accidentally fulfill the quest condition for you. As your usual actions are to lay a tile, grow a bamboo, or eat a bamboo, turns are very quick. There's continual satisfaction through the game as you tick quests off, there's interest in other player's turns in seeing if anyone might be progressing things in such a way as might help you, allowing you to work on other stuff Transamerica style. The game ends in the right timeframe and because turns are quick, and the game is easy to teach, it's non-gamer friendly - the beautiful bits help here as well. You can easily see yourself playing this a lot as a chilled out meaty semi-filler closer/opener type game.

What I like:
- Adorable components

What I don't like:
- High randomness of tile draws
- High randomness of goal draws
- Under the cute exterior is a semi-thinky interior
- Under the cute exterior can be a bit of a vicious game

It's ok. It just doesn't have enough stuff I like to offset the stuff I don't. I think it's quite a bit heavier than BGG voters: 2.4.

テーマ自体面白く、そのテーマとマッチしたコンポーネントとシステム。
要素やルールは簡潔に整っているし、プレイ感も軽い。

基本ルールだと引き勝ちがあるし、それを抜きにしても運比重の強さは否めない。
また上級ルールで達成していたらそのカードを捨てるというのも、一度手札に入れて何順か待機ということが非公開情報な時点で可能な為、こちらを中心に採用する気にもなりにくい

When I saw the artwork I put Takenoko in my “Want to play” list.

When I read the rulebook I immediately promoted Takenoko to my wishlist and if I hadn’t bought so many board games last month, I would have surely ordered it.

Then I played it οn board game arena. I removed it from every list. 

I found it to be completely unbalanced. During the game I felt that I didn’t have control on anything at all. I didn’t feel that there was an objective to fulfill. I got completely bored making moves hopping for the game to end.

I was sure I was going to like it. I found the rules very interesting. I don’t know what is wrong with it but it just doesn’t work. Shame.-

P.S. Felt like the “Chasing the dragon” video game on South Park.

After first try:

When it seems like the most important thing about the game is that the Panda is "soooo cute" it must be a hint that it's not such a great game. 

It was fairly simple with imho too much randomness, and too little strategy. 

After a few more plays: The game work well with children and I don't mind playing it with my nieces, but I will probably never buy the game.

RATING: 8
Great game! Scales well; fun with 2 players and fun with more than 2.  Rolling the weather die makes each turn exciting and different.  Then you always get at least 2 actions to choose each turn.  So you have choices, but you're simply trying to complete objectives on your cards.  So that keeps it from getting too "thinky".  Lots of fun!

15 plays - Light and fun. The pieces really 'pop' and for this reason, it is always a delight to bring out to new players.  While strategy and repeat plays will make you a better player, there does end up being quite an element of luck with card draws, dice rolls, tile draws etc. For the game that Takenoko is trying to be however, I feel the luck is well integrated and adds to the fun of the game'.

Takenoko is a contract fulfillment game in which players draw contracts randomly from one of three decks.  Basically, you're either trying to get the shared landscape to look a certain way, or have the panda consume a certain combination of bamboo colors.  The value of the contracts weren't the same, and oddly, did not often reflect its difficulty.  This proved particularly problematic as, after you hit your limit, players could not draw new contract cards until they had completed the ones they had.  So, the game really hinged on luck of the draw with contract cards.  On the other hand, the components are really outstanding.

A light fun little game, where you're trying to achieve multiple goals. You have limited actions during your round, so you must plan accordingly and help yourself more than you might help the others. Easy to teach and nice theme. Things though might be very random, as you might rarely see the tiles that match your objective cards.

Loved it since the day I saw it.  I believe Wil Wheaton's Tabletop was the first place I saw this game.  Bought it and brought it to the table despite all the teasing about being "panda boy" from my friends.  Some of my friends haven't given this a chance yet, but even my 71 year old father finally did, and he greatly enjoyed it.  My wife and I love it and play two player games every so often.  I'm sure once the holdouts give in, they will realize it is a simple yet elegant game and not a game solely for babies or girls just because it has a cute little panda figurine in it.

一款簡單的策略遊戲，也是推坑新手很適合的遊戲。玩家手上會有三個種類的目標牌，分別是：板塊拼起來的顏色、貓熊吃各色的竹子、地上長出特定高度的竹子三類，遊戲的分數就是靠完成這些目標牌來獲得。 每個玩家自己的回合分兩階段，第一是擲一顆"天氣骰"，看骰子結果有一些事情可以做，第二階段是行動5選2來執行，看是要抽板塊來放、移動貓熊去吃竹子、移動園丁去種竹子、多拿幾張目標卡、拿個灌溉水道來放5種選2種。誰先完成7張目標卡可以結束遊戲，但最後不一定是先完成7張的贏就是了。

Played on BGA. My first game I got slaughtered because of not knowing the rules well. I can see this as a light game with some strategy, but I probably won't ask to play it.

Played a second time at my local meetup during International Tabletop Day and it was pretty fun. The guys at the table know this game so well that I lose horribly again. Will want to play again.

Light game where you manage the bamboo garden at the Imperial Japanese Court, including the emperors gift panda. The most striking thing about this game are the looks. I was very pleasantly surprised by the feeling that the garden expanded and the bamboo grew and was eaten as the gardener and the panda moved around. The pieces look very nice, including the prepainted gardener and panda miniatures. The only thing worth noting is that the bamboo pieces doesn't always fit into each other.

Short overview of play:

Each player starts with three scoring cards, one of each kind (tiles,gardener and panda)

Each turn, the player chooses two of five different actions. Place a tile, take an irrigation piece, move the gardener, move the panda and take a scoring card. The player may also score one or more cards during his turn.

The tile action allows the player to take three tiles, choose one and place it in the garden. If a pattern of irrigated tiles matching a scoring card is created, that card can be scored.

The irrigation action allows the player to take an irrigation piece. The acquired piece can be placed in the garden immediately or saved on the player mat for later use. Placing irrigation pieces is not an action in itself, so can be done immediately following a tile action.

The gardener moves around the garden, making bamboo grow. If there are bamboo growth matching the pattern on a scoring card, that card can be scored.

The panda moves around the garden, eating the growing bamboo which the player collects on his player mat. If the bamboo pieces on the mat matches the set on a scoring card, those pieces can be discarded back to the box to score that card.

Taking a scoring card does just that.

Play continues until one player has scored a number of cards determined by the number of players. Then all other players take an extra turn and the scoring cards for each player are summed up to determine the winner.

Cuki nég személyes játék, melyben a japán császár főkertészeit alakítjuk, aki megbízást kapott arra, hogy a kínai császár ajándékát, egy pandát gondozza.
Ehhez az kell, hogy egyre több bambuszt kell termeszteni a kis bélpoklosnak.
Először dobunk a kockával, ezzel az időjárást alakítjuk (plusz akció), majd választhatunk a hat különböző akcióból kettőt (parcella lerakás, vízvezeték lehelyezés, kertész áthelyezés, panda etetés, új célkártya húzása.
Alapvetően családi játék, de a gémerek is megtalálhatják benne a saját játékukat.

Pretty, pretty and cute: you can get hosed by other players 'randomly' moving the panda; and, let's face it, if the 'extra action' rolls are unevenly distributed, that can be a huge factor. Good, though.

Wife loves it.  Sister loves it.  I just like it.  The theme is pretty great, but there's a ton of screwage for such a light-hearted game.  I can't tell you how many times those two harpies have set out to deny me the one freaking pink bamboo I need to complete three different objectives.  They do it on purpose. Screw them, and screw Takenoko!

RATING: 5

Takenoko is a game where you are manipulating and building a bamboo forest, while simultaneously fending/feeding off the Emperor's panda. The entire game revolves around playing scoring cards to earn VP, and these cards also are the timer for the endgame. As such, if you don't manage your ratios of acquiring cards, completing the things you need  to play cards, and then playing your cards (and hypothetically, keeping your enemies from doing so). The fact that you're getting unintentionally wrecked the whole time by the other players doesn't help.

This, plus the fact that you gain some bonus randomly based on a die-roll, means you don't have the sort of control that I want. 

Overall there's too much randomness in a game that on first glance seems it should be a euro, and that irritates me.

RATING: 5
Visually a treat - the components are very nice, liked the stacking bamboo stalks.

Attempting to complete secret missions of 3 types, Develop land, feed the panda or grow bamboo. Since everyone is going about their business at the same time there is a fair bit of chaos as the turn cycle backs to you. 

The expansion leads to a panda rush to get to the bonus chips and the new tiles are powerful.

Ok for what it is but not a favorite

Found this to be merely alright--too light for my tastes strategically. I'm not convinced there is great balance between the scoring cards, and some house rules seem necessary to make up for the fact you can draw some that are already or nearly complete compared to some that require a lot of work. The die to determine what extra action you get can also be quite annoying and allow certain players to get moves they want while blocking others. Overall it feels like there is a really interesting game that could be had here, but with the rules as they are this is simply much too random for me to really want to play again.

Played this for the first time last night and woke up thinking about it. The game is a light to medium-light game mechanically, but pretty addictive. If I hadn't known beforehand, I doubt I would have guessed this title came from the same mind as Ghost Stories and 7 Wonders. Great job, Mr. Bauza.

Jan 2015:  It is a great game and if I needed to play games with younger players it would be on the top of the list. I do feel, in an adult crowd, the re-playability might suffer.

RATING: 3
Takenoko is a prototypical example of what I don't like about contemporary middle-weight Euros:

* Limited, indirect, and ultimately uninteresting player interaction. Here, players help each other indirectly (players build and improve the board/garden together, and players score for certain completed configurations). However, because objectives are secret, players don't really know how they are helping each other, and it's a waste of time to try to deduce your opponents' objectives.

* Hidden, randomly determined personal objectives, which dramatically reduces strategic depth and player interaction -- players are not going to bother to deduce what objectives their opponents' have, nor do they have the time to hinder them

* Bloated with too many rules and mechanisms considering the game's strategic and tactical shallowness

Veramente un gioiellino! Colori e componenti materiali sono di ottima fattura e le miniature decisamente belle, quella del Panda e quella del Contadino, una meraviglia per gli occhi. FUMETTOSO! Semplice ma non banale, divertente e veloce da spiegare, buona interazione. Ambientazione molto particolare e riuscita. L'idea del povero Panda affamato che gira liberamente in un giardino Zen divorando Bamboo, mentre un Giardiniere indaffarato lo insegue, in ogni caso va premiata. La mappa cambia ad ogni partita regalando varietà e rigiocabilità a non finire. Per ogni genere di giocatore, dai "principianti" agli esperti. Punto forte... le ragazze lo adorano!

RATING: 6
There are many satisfying and impactful choices to be made and various, easy ways to score on each of your turns.  Might be too luck dependent for a game that seems like you want to have a strategy, but you can't have one longer than a turn or so, because the game conditions change so much and so often on your opponent's turns.  You can aim to develop some game conditions, but you cannot rely on them to work out and be stable long enough for you to score them.  Pieces are gorgeous.

Reminds me of Alhambra - everyone else can totally stuff up your move before your turn! Mission accomplishment is straight forward, you just need the panda or gardener in the right place at the start of your turn. My game was far too slow, playing this quickly would help things a lot. Also, one of those games that's lots of fun when you win, but particularly frustrating when you don't. Very nice looking game.

Component Quality:
Excellent. Thick tiles and beautiful painted miniatures make this a very nice game to look at. The box insert stores everything perfectly (but doesn't leave room for sleeving the cards)

Gameplay:
Simple. After one reading of the short rulebook I had all the actions down. It took a single game to memorize the different weather effects too. I would recommend players start with the advanced rules right away to help eliminate a little bit of luck. Takenoko is very light on strategy and really comes down to drawing the right cards at the right time (which is almost completely random). It plays a lot like Ticket to Ride, but with less strict goals (no negative points for failing to complete a goal). The theme helps make it fun and turns flow smoothly, but if you're wanting anything besides a cake-walk out of Takenoko, I recommend using some house-rules. A variant or two could make this a real gem.

RATING: 8.47
Our first play of this was 4 new players....and it felt long, slow, and not overly engaging.  Then, we played several more times as a 2P game where it really shines.  The game goes quickly.  25min game time.  You have to set proper expectations...don't expect too much, but it's a fun experience.

Here's what I'd recommend:
1) when you achieve an objective, play it, don't hold it in your hand.  It's nice to see who's winning.  This helps with some good banter around the table.
2) don't use the 'advanced rule.'  That rule makes the plot cards less desirable late in the game.  It's a great thing to pick up an objective card that is already complete.....lay down the card and score the points.

Beautiful, intuitive game.  Has really interesting decisions where you can press your luck toward the end of the game to try to get a point card already on the board.  Die roll and card draw luck can play a factor so there may not be enough here for those who like gamer games.  Fits the family game genera.   I think once you get the know the decks then you can really play a probability card when deciding which decks to draw from which may counteract the initial thought that the card draw is just blind luck.

Nothing special here, and not particularly exciting - but the gameplay is light and somewhat fun, and the components are very pretty. It's also rather silly in a good way (why do you get certain special powers in certain weather conditions, thematically? The storm one makes vague sense, but not any of the others - but for me this just adds to the game's charm). No skill needed here - or at least very little - but still quite entertaining.

The mechanics of this game have something going for them, but since the makers of the game don't understand colour blindness - it is completely unplayable to me.

When matching cards up to tiles, it might have been possible to play - IF THEY HAD USED THE SAME SHADES OF COLOUR ACROSS THE TWO!!!!

Quite simply, 10% of the population cannot play this game without constantly asking "does this match with that?". This just completely disgusts me and locks me out of the game, hence a very low mark from me (not giving a 1 as I can recognise there is a game here for people who can see the different colours)

Can a game be awesome and yet very bland and boring? Takenoko seems to be that game... it undeniably scores very high in the components and aesthetics department, the main appeal to what is an otherwise flat game.

That's not to say it's bad however, Bauza is completely on target with the audience and the game is interesting enough, but the luck mitigation and chaos control is low, ultimately making it a non-starter for gamers wanting a bit more than a cute game to play with the kids.

So... possibly one of the best family game out there, but fails to really shake the genre in any way, there's certainly no Dixit to be found here.

This is a very nice looking and fun little game. 

My only real problem with this game is the balance of the objective cards in games with more than two players. In the game, there are three different colors of tiles with different distributions- there are more green tiles and fewer pink tiles. Thus, the objectives for the pink tiles are worth more points to accomplish than the yellow, which in turn are worth more points than the green objectives. In theory this makes sense, and I think they are pretty balanced for the 2 player game. However, once you get multiple people in the game, the balance goes out the door. In those games, you can have multiple people working on the same color and that color becomes much easier to get on the board than the value of the objectives would indicate. 

For an example: in one game I played, three of the players drew multiple pink objectives at the start of the game and the fourth drew all green objectives. The three "pink" players all dug through the stack of tiles looking for pink tiles, irrigating the pink tiles and growing the pink bamboo. The "green" player was working solo growing up the green tiles. By the time the "green" player finished his first objective, all three "pink" players had finished at least two pink objectives. The pink objectives were much easier to get, and they were worth a lot more points.

Another game where the end is too soon. After there are a lot of tiles on the board, it's too easy to get a completed objective. Also the objetives don't seem very balanced. Why go for panda cards when you can get the other two objetives and they are already done for you?

It's only not worse because the components are outstanding! The minis and tiles are really good.

We play this with the following variants:

2) Each player gets one irrigation stick during setup on their board.

We used to play with the following, but now we no longer feel the need to:

3) The ? on the die refers to a lost gardener. Instead of choosing any die result, instead the gardener goes to any hex and does his gardening action (similar to lightning panda).

Two player game is slightly flawed. The bamboo collection objectives are the easiest to complete, so there is little incentive to use the other two objective types. Approaching the the game in this way also makes it less necessary to expand titles, purchase irrigation channels, or use improvements. Using the advanced player rules varient (prohibiting a player from taking an objective card already complete in the garden) further disincentivizes playing gardener and plot objective cards. 

A four player game would require players to vary their strateges. However, adding players increases the downtime between turns.

The game is a bit repetitive, playing the same few actions turn after turn.

i do not understand this hype.
yes it´s ok, that all players build together a landscape.
but there is a big snag in it!
the mission cards are totally unbalanced.
there is nothing as easy to perform as "panda"-cards which counts more points than "lanscape"-cards which must be watered first. so everybody draws panda-cards.
secondly there are mission cards to build a bambus tree on a tile "no panda" which are much easier to fulfill like the other "gardener-cards".

This is fantastic as a light family game.

It's the type of game that can keep the power gamer in the group entertained without burning the rest of the family.  My rating of an 8 is category (kids) dependent.  In other words it does not compare to heavier games that I may rate as 8 as well.

I have been intrigued by the many pictures of this game on BGG. July 2014, I got to try it out at the opening event of FLGS [url=http://demospel.be/]Demo-Spel[/url] and I immediately bought a copy (the fact they gave 10% off on that day did, of course, help me with that decision).

The components for this game are absolutely gorgeous. Prepainted miniatures for the gardener and panda, sturdy cardboard plot tiles for the garden, wooden irrigation channels and pieces of bamboo. All very colourful and family-friendly.

Goal of the game is to get the most points by completing objective cards. Depending on the number of players, the game ends with a final turn after one player completes a set amount of objectives. There's three kinds of objectives: Panda - where points are scored by making the panda eat certain colors of bamboo, Plot - where points are scored by placing the tiles in certain colors and shapes on the table, and Bamboo - where points are scored by growing bamboo to certain hights/on certain tiles/in certain amounts.

To achieve their objectives, the players get two actions per turn - though they can't take the same action twice. They can move the panda and eat bamboo, move the gardener to grow bamboo, place additional plots of land on the table, irrigate said plots, or add another objective card to their hand (max. five). After the first turn, the players also roll a die, to add a random event to their turn (grow bamboo of a certain color, get a third action, be allowed to take the same action twice,...)

Turns flow fast and the game is relatively conflict-free. Players are mostly focusing on achieving their own objectives, instead of working agaist their fellow players - though this is possible, depending on the playstyle of your group. This flexible stance against player conflict, makes this suitable for many different kinds of groups.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] No. They are two of the most beautiful pre-painted pawns I have ever seen.

Haven't quite put my finger on this game yet, but it is very relaxing compared to some other games I play.  I'm guessing this game works for me because:
1. I like hidden scoring mechanisms.
2. It is very simple to teach and play (aka I can remember the rules now that I've played once or twice).

I tend towards the unforgiving games (Galaxy Trucker, Robinson Crusoe) so maybe I just needed something like this.

I will say that this isn't one I'm usually dying to play, but it goes over really well with newcomers so it will stay in my collection.

I wasn't sure about the strategy of this one until someone said something that really clicked. It's kinda like rock-paper-scissors: if people are placing tiles for Emperor cards, you should use their land to grow bamboo for the gardener; if they are growing for gardener cards, you should eat their bamboo with the panda; if they are eating for panda cards, you should place tiles, I guess.

In theory if you can read what the other players are doing you can capitalise and do better. In practise I draw a lot of green bamboo cards and lose to someone who drew a lot of pink. My first few games of this devolved into everyone placing tiles and picking up Emperor cards, and whoever blind-drew the most already completed cards won. Imagine my surprise when I heard people saying that Emperor is the weakest strategy! I definitely need to play more of this to implement what I wrote above. And maybe house-rule a way to exchange unwanted (green) cards for better (pink) ones. I have Chibis now too.

Not as involved as the rulebook make sit seem; on the other hand the game takes a bit of focus for new initiates. Afterwards I can imagine this being something one plays over coffee and conversation, like dominoes. The die and draw of tiles and cards rules the game quite a bit, although I imagine there is more skill involved than may first appear.

Advanced rule about drawing already-completed cards helps make the game more competitive, as well as some variants discussed on BGG.

Decent. Very cute looking and in itself really a nice 'gateway game' into euro games for unexperienced players.

In a game for casual players, a bit of luck/randomness is really no problem. However, the drawing of quest cards is WAY too random even for a casual game. Basically, sometimes you draw a quest card that is instantly fulfilled without you having done literally anything for it, giving you a ton of points for free; points that other quest cards would require you to spend 1/4 of the whole game on.

Even for a family game, this mockery of any strategy/tactics you thought of is a bit too much and does spoil the fun in what could have been an otherwise great game.

RATING: 6
Nice and innocent family game. Lovely bits. The kids enjoy this one. I find it a little random. Very tactical with some lucky card draws providing game winning bonus points for zero effort. Still, the journey is fun enough. Turns whish on by as you perform your bonus die roll and two actions. There's a few choices, but it's more of a patience game as you let other players blithely stumble along and irrigate and grow and eat what you need them to. There's some tension as you hope they don't affect your plans. I like that the player triggering the end will not necessarily be the one winning the game. Harmless enough. I don't mind it, but it's not something I'm particularly looking forward to.

First of all, amazing components. Second, its gorgeous. Look at the panda and the gardener and the bamboos.

Some adult especially boys will have complain over this cute game but not me. I enjoy it very much. It's not a very competitive game but some "take that" element is there even though it's mostly unintentional.

It's relaxing, it's soothing, and it's CUTE.

Oh, don't forget to play this with advanced rules (when there's a mission already done when you're grabbing a new miasion card, discard it). 

If you have kids, BUY THIS. 
I can only wish my father had bought me this when I was 5 or 6. It would be a memory to be hold forever.

Cute theme. Beautiful components. The give and take of the gardener and the panda provide a nice balance for each other. Playing a game of Takenoko always feels very relaxing, which is not something I usually look for (I love high-stress, high tension games) but given the game's theme, the zen feel really seems to work.

One problem I have with Takenoko is that it often feels like multiplayer solitaire. Everyone is using the same board, so there are ways to block others from getting points - placing a tile somewhere inconvenient or eating bamboo from a tile someone has been gardening - but none of these are very direct, and they are stalls more than anything else.

Our Game of 2011.
Rented from Boardgameexchange and we both enjoyed it so much that we quickly added it to our collection. A beautifully produced light strategy game that probably is in the mix with Ticket to Ride, Escape and Pandemic when introducing new people to the hobby.
Highly Recommended. 2 or more players.

 I wanted to like this game. It is easily one of the most visually appealing games I have played. Towards the end when the garden is big and there are stalks of bamboo every where it looks like something special. However, I just did not find this game much fun. There was no tension in trying to complete objectives. Every turn it was possible to make progress on goals so it really just felt like the winner had more to do with who got the better cards. This really fell flat for me.

I like it, but I think it'll take a few more plays for it to really grow on me. It suffers from Bauza's desire to have too many moving parts, and to include iconography that takes a game or two to learn how to parse. But, generally fun.

Promising abstract strategy that gets clunked up by card draws (secret objectives) and a random-event die roll. Try to get bamboo formations and land formations to align with your cards, while every player shares a communal farmer that grows bamboo and panda that eats bamboo. Nice visuals, but just not a fan of games where secret objectives are such a big part of the game.

2012 early Christmas gift for Julia from Zack

My wife always likes to play this game with me on a weekend afternoon.  I like the quiet nature of this game with a beautiful Asian gardening theme illustrated by 3D components that look amazing: stackable pastel wooden bamboo pieces, large detailed land hex tiles, painted wood irrigation markers, and painted panda and gardener miniatures. This is probably one of the best looking games we own that can appeal to anyone willing to give it a try unless they are determined to only play heavy thematic sci-fi or fantasy Ameritrash games.  It's a work of art in a box with a hospitable kind of gameplay that can welcome new folks into the tabletop gaming hobby.  This is a wonderful family-friendly all-around gateway game; we are proud to have it on our shelf.

After busting Todd's chops over and over about playing this, I finally caved and decided to give it a shot.  It was actually pretty fun.  I found that the panda and gardener tasks seemed easier (and more rewarding) to complete than the land tile ones.  I would definitely NOT recommend playing with the variant that if you draw an already completed tile task, that you put it back and draw another.  They just aren't worth enough to matter.  It's a light game that I think would be a hit with anyone with girls that love pandas :-)

RATING: 7
REALLY simple once you get all the rules down. Probably could be used as a gateway game, but more experienced or strategic gamers will tire of it after one or two games. I played it at a cafe and might buy a used copy just add to my collection. While it's cute and fun, it's also too expensive for such a basic game in my opinion.

Don't listen to people saying there's not a whole lot to this game - it's true, but that doesn't detract from it. The game is easy to teach, easy to learn, and is very well-themed. Bottom line is that it's fun, and there are aspects that both veteran gamers and new players can appreciate.

We love the adorable Kawai inspired artwork and the easy to comprehend, yet strategic decisions of Takenoko. Each game plays quickly yet is completely different owing to the myriad of ways the tiles get placed. We like that the game has some cooperative elements with players often assisting others to build irrigation channels out to dry bamboo tiles, yet each player is secretly scheming precisely how they alone will benefit most from a certain configuration of bamboo. There is an element of luck with the weather die, but it can often be mitigated by judicious selection of your subsequent moves. The component quality is generally good although the cardstock for the player mats is very flimsy and each person should get three wooden turn markers instead of two for instances when you roll the sun. Other than those minor or quibbles, the components are top notch especially the painted panda and farmer figures.

Nov 2017 update: Our Collector's edition Takenoko arrived today and we broke it right out to play after Turkey Day leftovers. We love this game so much! This extra large size version is even better. Exquisite components and art and an exceptional case. Best of all we won it on auction for $100!

RATING: 1.5
Better than Tokaido. Not sure if that's saying much. Certainly I see a design approach: let's put scores on cards and cards tell you what you do. Seems a bit lazy: here there actions you can do, and here are cards which reward these actions. I don't see anything that would tie the game together, on the mechanical level at least. It's just pieces put together in the same box. 

While the game is an enjoyable family type fare, there's really no rhyme or reason to it's theme. Who are we? What are we doing? What's this panda doing in the garden? The booklet explains it, with this far fetched tale of [i]"you're master zen gardeners and emperor sent you a panda which is eating up the garden". [/i] Uhm? Ok. It gets better: "you must impress the emperor". What? That idiot who sent us this menace of a panda in the first place? 

Verdict: it's the panda game. If you need a panda in a family game, get this, otherwise it's nothing else that makes it stand out of the pack. I also begin to see Hanabi as that weird inspired game in Bauza's otherwise pretty samey ouvre.

Takenoko is a chaotic game of bamboo cultivation, which is probably one of the cutest themes I've ever heard of. The game is family-friendly - it has high production value and the rules are simple enough so that you can just pick up and play, although the rules for irrigation always escape me for some reason.

This game, however, is best played with 2 players. The hidden objectives may be fun as players curse their opponents for unwittingly disrupting their plans, but a lot of control over what happens on the board is lost with more players and some objectives become fiendishly difficult to achieve. Just keep in mind that this is a light, tactical game and luck plays a significant role in it.

The cute panda miniature, wooden bamboo pieces, and colorful tiles are attractive and make this a good game to play with non-gamer friends and family.  Oh, the comic in on the front of the rule book that tells the back story is funny too.  Other than that, the game itself is just okay.  Players try to accomplish three different types of goals (expanding the zoo, growing bamboo, or feeding the panda) by placing tiles and improvement tiles or moving the gardener or panda.  There's a few little other things going on, but that's basically the game.  It works and it's cute, but it's not great.  It's also a race game, so the first player to hit a certain number of completed cards triggers the last round.  However, that player first gets a couple bonus points and then the other players get one more turn to try to catch up. That's never really possible and so it feels like the end game isn't quite right.  This game feels like a re-worked and re-themed Ticket to Ride in many ways.  Overall, it's just okay, but my wife will occasionally play this game with me and that's good, especially since she doesn't like to play games very often.

I am dumbfounded as to why they decided to produce a large collector's version of this game nearly 2 years after it was originally released.  It's just an okay game that was never even very popular.  I don't understand, but I guess if the goal was to get people talking about the game again, then the definitely accomplished that...

RATING: 5
Amazon had a goldbox deal on boardgames, and I went with this instead of Pandemic. 

As many people have pointed out, I don't think the objectives are balanced. IMO panda cards yield slightly too many points, and plot cards not enough. Green plot scoring cards are pretty much useless, IMO, and I am always reluctant to draw from that deck for fear of pulling one. It wouldn't be so bad late in the game, but it's easiest to complete the plot objectives early (we play the "advanced" variant). Having that card load your hand for the whole game is annoying. 

On the other hand, drawing 2 of the 3 green/yellow/red panda cards gives you a slight advantage. Six points feels like too much for that card. Probably, (again, just my opinion) panda cards should be worth 1 pt less, and most plot cards should be worth 1 pt more. Could just be the way we play, though, since we don't have all that many plays.

A charming gateway "euro" game with great production value to entice even the most jaded non-gamer.

Panda!

For me this is almost the perfect game. As easy to learn and teach and plays as per box (45 mins).

As mentioned countless times on here, the components and figures are wonderful. However the theme is somewhat tacked on, as this could be any abstract tile laying game (but the theme and story works).

Only issue for me is the bonus cards, as everyone seems to go for the Panda bonuses, as they seem the easiest to get. Whilst the gardener bonus card tend to get left till last.

A very solid 9/10 for now.

Its pretty. Very pretty. And its got a panda. And bamboo thingies. And its set in pseudo-Japan. And its in pastel colours.
As for the rest, I am not so sure. The game has quite a bit of luck - get the right objective cards and Bob's your uncle. Also, die rolls make a huge difference. All that is ok. But what bugs me a bit is the extremely random spread of rewards for the different objectives. 
With two players, the game is a bit more tactical. With three its more luck. With four its more or less pure chaos.
Not a terrible game at all, but also not something I need to play. There are plenty of light and medium games that I would rather play in 45 minutes.

This is the most adorable game I own. It doesn't take much to convince someone to play after they see the box. Takenoko is low complexity and features a scoring system that is only minimally based on luck. It plays well with 2-4 players.

Don't forget that the gardener grows bamboo on the tile he lands on, and all adjacent squares (assuming these are irrigated). We played this incorrectly for several plays, thinking the gardener only grows bamboo on the tile he lands on.

A gyönyörű pandás, bambuszos játékot már régóta ki szerettem volna próbálni, sajnos csalódást okozott. Bár már felkészültem a csalódásra, mert olvastam rossz híreket a játékról. Egy bambuszkeretet menedzselnek a játékosok, ahol két-két akciója, plusz egy szerencsefaktor szerinti kockadobás plusz akciója is van a játékosoknak köreikben. Lehet hatszögletű lapkákkal a területet bővíteni, öntözőcsatornát építeni ezekhez. Lehet kertésszel bambuszt nevelni, illetve pandával megdézsmálni. Háromfajta célkártya szerezhető a játékban folyamatosan, amiből minél többet próbálunk megoldani. Sajnos ez a játék gyenge pontja. Mintha nem gondolták volna végig a célkártyák nehézségeit. Teljesen logikátlan némely kártya szerezhető pontszáma. A kártyafajták nehézségei is nagyon különbözőek. Az pedig teljesen a szerencsén múlik kihez milyen kártya jut. Jobb lett volna 3-at húz 1-et választ megoldással ezt kipróbálniuk a készítőknek, mert ez így nem lett túl jó.
Könnyed, családi játék a Takenoko, amely legnagyobb érdem a kivitele, a festett figurákkal és gyönyörű bambuszokkal. Sajnos nem nyűgözött le a mechanizmus terén.

The term "gateway game" has often loosely been applied to games that just have a simplistic ruleset. That, alone, is not enough to serve as a "gateway" into the hobby. Takenoko has enough substance to captivate the interest of newbies with sophisticated taste, who may go on to appreciate today's strategy games.

Takenoko is a beautiful game that I enjoy at all player counts. It isn't very complicated, but that simplicity makes it a very good family game. It has a very fun charm and the color and look of the game are great for drawing people in. Scoring is normally tight and plays usually last about a half hour. My only real gripe is that the player pawns are not distinctive enough, and many times, we forget to place them on our actions altogether. We still play it from time to time, but as we've advanced in the hobby, our aim is usually for something a bit heavier.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
1 play, 4er

This is a cute, pretty light, family style game with pretty bits, best played quickly. It's got a very nicely sculpted panda and farmer figures, cool little bamboo stem sculpts in 3 colors, and nicely illustrated terrain tiles. I'd be happy to play it, but I prefer heavier games.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Place a water tile in the center, with farmer and panda tokens on it, and 6 terrain tiles around it. Deal each player 1 scoring card from each of the 3 decks.

On your turn, you get 2 different actions plus a random (d6) bonus action. The bonus may be:
- an extra action
- take the same action twice
- grow a bamboo somewhere already on the board
- take a terrain modifier token (limited supply; these ban panda from hex, make bamboo grow faster, or irrigate hex even without irrigation stick)
- move panda anywhere
- wild; choose one of above
The normal actions allow you to:
- add terrain tile (draw 3, keep 1)
- place irrigation stick, extending from central hex or another piece; any hex newly irrigated gets a free bamboo stem of that terrain color
- move farmer in straight line: bamboos on final tile and adjacent tiles of same color grow
- move panda in straight line: eat a stem of bamboo on tile you land upon
- draw a scoring card (from 3 decks, corresponding to terrain configurations, bamboo colors eaten, or bamboos colors/sizes growing on the board).
You can play the scoring cards face up during your turn when you satisfy their conditions.

The game ends when any player has 7 face up cards (everyone else gets one final turn); most VP wins.

This game has potential.  It looks great, it has a nice number of choices, the actions make sense.  I just don't like how drawing already achieved goals is so swingy.  There is an optional rule to discard these but you can still get one that is almost done.

This is a beautiful and lovely game. A friend commented that the cards were a little small and the bamboo was occasionally wonky, but otherwise the components can't be faulted - they're lovely to touch and to look at.

I would have given it a 10, except for the above quibbles and that the objective cards, so far, don't seem as balanced as they could be. But, on the day I played it for the first time, I played it more than once and it got a place straight on the top shelf of my games, usually reserved for classics and favourites that are out every week without fail. I think it might be one of those games.

Edit, May 14: needs more objectives. Down to 8.5.

RATING: 5
I play enough board games that I can recognize the value in a game like this one as a family game.  The game is cute as hell with bright whimsical colors and cute painted farmer and panda figurines and stackable pastel-colored bamboo.  It is very simple to teach and understand and plays in 45 minutes or less.  And the theme itself is very family friendly, just a farmer growing colorful bamboo for a chubby panda to chow down on.

Even with all that recognition though I just get so little value out of a game like this.  I don't have kids and I rarely ever play with kids.  As such my gaming tastes usually include much more depth and much more interesting decisions.  This game is about split in two with half of it being complete luck and the other half being tactical decision making but usually the best decision is incredibly obvious.

The game is played with players taking actions to control the makeup of a board and the pieces on it.  The actions allow you to place new board tiles, irrigate tiles so bamboo will grow there, moving a farmer around to grow bamboo, moving a panda around to eat bamboo, and finally, drawing objective cards.

The objective cards are the win condition of the game, they give you points based on placing certain board tiles, growing certain colors of bamboo, and eating certain colors of bamboo with the panda.  The reason this game is 50% luck is you have no control over the objectives you draw, very little control over the tiles you draw, and a random event occurs at the beginning of each of your turns.  Some times you can draw an objective card that is almost (or completely) impossible to achieve, so drawing it is a completely wasted action.

The other half, as I said, involves tactical use of your available actions to achieve these goals but as I said, the best option is usually very apparent.  If you have 2/3 of a board layout objective done your action is to draw new tiles.  If you need to grow a 4-high stalk of pink bamboo and the farmer is in line with a 3-high stalk then you take the farmer action.  If he's not in line with it then you don't take that action and hope your opponent moves him into a better position later.

It's very paint-by-numbers with very little chance to come ahead via game play.  9 times out of 10 the winner of this game just drew more easily achievable or valuable objectives and I stand by that estimate.

I would love to like this game but I don't actually. It's too much lucky driven because of the cards and it is too much repetitive. It's not bad but it's not good enough too. The panda theme and mainly the artwork and the components save the package.

RATING: 8
It comes along as Catan's and Kingdom Builder's cute little cousin, so it is clearly up my alley. Irrigating ground, growing bamboo and feeding the little panda, those are the three type of scoring cards. The positive trick here is that all grow and score on the same board so other's actions either benefit or jeopardize your own cards. The design is awesomely cute but the game itself is just great, simple and fun. Shorter than for example Catan, I have to say I am a enchanted. Played with 4 which was fine yet I wondered if the game is better with 3 since it doesn't have much player interaction the waiting time for your turn could be a downer in the future when one is more familiar with the game.

Borrowed from Julian.  Probably more interesting with three players.  We keep playing it, but Tom feels like the "book" is pretty obvious and that it loses replay value quickly.  I think it's slightly too "board game-y" to be a gateway game, but good as a light-medium game?  It's just slightly too long for that function.

I can recommend it to everyone, it's a beautiful game, although the luck factor can be frustrating sometimes. Some house rules can balance it, like: you can't have more than 2 of the same type of goal cards. (To prevent that everybody goes for panda cards)

RATING: 7.4
Great elegant designed game with great depth for such a "light" game.  Can be played really quickly 
(30 mins) with some light meaningful decisions to be made. 

Has some luck involved which I like a bit of to keep things fresh and not overly "static".

I never got Ticket to Ride, it was too simple for me. Very nice game and elegant but I just didn't prefer playing it.

Takenoko replaces Ticket to Ride for me as it's still a light gateway game that can be taught quickly to non-gamers and played quickly, yet is a slight step up in terms of complexity. Takenoko is a slightly deeper set collecting (with 3 ways to do so) game than Ticket to Ride and for such a light game I like that it has a sort of personal worker placement board mechanic where you choose which two actions from a list that you'd like to do for each turn as well as a separate differnt list of actions that you can perform that is determined by a dice roll. Ingenius really - random and non-random all in one for some balance.

This is still only a filler for me.  I much prefer to play a game that is deeper than Takenoko but for such a light game and this niche level it's really a great game!

This is a very cute, cleverly designed, beautifully manufactured game that is an incredible bore to play.  Playing with the advanced, "discard completed objective cards" would make it slightly less boringly luck-dependent, but in general there isn't much in the way of meaningful decision-making happening in the game.  The physical production is gorgeous and I can see how this would make a really nice family game, but family games aren't what I'm looking for just now.

Players work on the same Imperial garden and score points for completing hidden objectives: get the panda to eat a certain combination of coloured bamboo; grow bamboo in a certain place to a certain height; place tiles in a certain configuration.

Really stunning production, including little gardener and panda figures and stackable wooden bamboo shoots, but the game itself is light and luck-heavy.

I'm rather worried about perverse incentives, because it seems to me that if other players are pro-actively attempting to fulfil their objectives, the ideal strategy is destructive leeching: do nothing but eat bamboo and draw panda-objective cards, which hurts other players at the same time as it helps you. But of course it's a Prisoner's Dilemma; if everyone is destructive the strategy works for no-one.

It's OK as a light game, particularly for non-gamers, but I don't think it holds up to repeated play.

Silly, cute game that has every right to exist but does nothing to amaze. Bright colors and adorable theme most likely help carry this game, but there's enough here to have a good time. Admittedly unsure where this game fits in my library these days... Carcassonne stands to provide more satisfaction at the same level of complexity -- but I suppose without such a cute theme, which might be good at times?? The bamboo pieces are fun to use.

relatively light game with cute panda theme

+ fun theme
+ mechanics
+ materials and looks
- a bit too abstract and comical
- simple and luck-dependent

I like that there are 3 different decks of achievement cards and that you can freely choose from which to draw. But sadly that introduces a lot of luck dependence. It's basically all about drawing the best easily solvable objectives for the given board situation.

I'd prefer a more realistic looking panda.

This one is a nice simple game - more than a filler, but not as deep as some games.  Has some "fun" frustrating moments - like when some jerk moves the panda to a patch you're trying to grow and eats it.

My friend doesn't like the cutesy art, but I think it's awesome.

Not sure of its staying power, but it's good for now.

Ever wanted to be a bamboo gardener in charge of a Panda bear the Princess got as a gift? Well here's your chance!  This game is bright, simple, and viscerally engaging.  Bamboo grows on the board as you irrigate and water it, you feed the panda, you plot out additional land for more gardening goodness. This game is a great gateway game, as it is simple, beautiful, and unique.  I rate it at a 6 because it is too simple for my tastes.  I will play it and bring it out if I think it will be a hit with the people I am playing with, but otherwise I prefer talking about it over playing it :).

A light, beautiful game of fulfilling personal goals. The turns are extremely quick and can be somewhat repetitive, but the goal cards are what keep the game interesting so you don't really notice the limitations of your actions. The game shows its depth in subsequent plays when you learn you're not only trying to fulfill your goals before the other players, but you're also striving to be economical in your movement and your choices of which goals to fulfill. The theme of Takenoko is somewhat charming, focused around a panda bear and a farmer, and could probably be enjoyed by all types of gamers. It can feel a little "meh" at times, but I find myself asking for it more often than I thought I would.

It's a pretty game, but not an especially good one.  The luck of the draw (in terms of tiles and VP cards) is too substantial for what is an abstract strategy game.  (Though maybe I should think of it more in terms of being a family game... Hmmm...)

RATING: 4
Will have to see how it holds up in the long run, but so far this is a fun, light game that looks great and is good with two.

Update: I've really got some issues. The dice rolls, for example. Some of the faces of the die are really helpful, but some are practically useless (like the one that lets you take a duplicate action). So, bad dice rolls can have a big impact on the game, and it's especially frustrating if your opponent keeps getting extra actions. People on the forums have also pointed out that some of the cards are unbalanced. And a game this simple shouldn't require a four-page official FAQ.

Sold.

Rated a 7 after my first play. It works nicely for a group of non-gamers to get into the gaming world. I'd consider it a fun little gateway. I'm not sure it has anything special about it besides it's welcoming artwork and loveable theme, but it's a nice game none the less.

The first time I played it, Enna won (9 years old), so that says something about the random factor. Anybody can win based on the card draws and how things play out.

I'm sure there are a few blocking strategies, but after the first play, it really felt luck driven in what objective cards you draw.

Beautiful presentation, though. I'll keep it for now, but I'm not sure it will stay in my collection for the long haul.

::UPDATE::

Takenoko is very much hyped for delivering a light-hearted game, with beautiful/cute/attractive/fun components. This assessment is correct.

If someone is interested in a game that delivers the above, then Takenoko will not disappoint. However...if someone wants a game that is filled with great gameplay, including strategy and planning, this is not your game.

I'll pull it out every now and then to entertain those who want a simple game with a simple rule set, with simply beautiful pieces. I won't pull it out when I'm with anybody who wants a real strategic gaming experience.

Takenoko is a light family game with a decent amount of randomness. You're laying tiles, growing bamboo, setting loose a voracious panda, and trying to accomplish goals on your scoring cards. Every turn you roll a die and get a special ability. Then you either draw a scoring card, move the gardener (grow stuff), move the panda (eat stuff), draw three land tiles and place one, or get a irrigation token. The game goes until someone scores seven scoring cards... that person gets a 2 point bonus for ending the game and everyone else gets another turn.

The game is largely about getting the right scoring cards (you have a hand limit of five) and accomplishing them. This is broken into 3 flavors, land cards where you score if certain color configurations of irrigated tiles appear on the board, panda cards which score if you return the correct color/quantity of bamboo you've eaten, and gardener cards where you score if the correct amount of bamboo is on the board on the correct tiles.

The combination of random card draws where some cards are simply easier to accomplish, although they reward you less, and the random die roll every turn probably keep this game from being something I want to play too often. On my first play, everyone spent the last turn drawing random scoring cards in the hope of getting something they could already accomplish. I won, but only because the second place player drew two scoring cards as his turn and got the card he could have accomplished last, when he no longer had an action left to make it good.

It's a short enough game that the randomness isn't too damning... but this is probably a game that I'd only really play as a family game or filler. With decent players the winner is going to be whoever lucked out on card draws.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70919/takenoko]Takenoko[/url] is one of the prettiest games of 2012, but isn't in the contest for the best one. Maybe this happened because I played only once in a 2 player game.

The game asks you to attend the needs of a Panda, and also make the garden bigger and the bambu taller. The gameplay revolves around objectives that reward points when completed, and these objectives are: make the garden in a given pattern (using the tiles), grow bambus in a certain way or to feed the Panda some sort of bambu. I'm under the impression that the types of objectives aren't really balanced - the ones that require the bambus to be in some way were much easier to complete and award more points than the ones that require to feed the Panda, that I found much more difficult to do.

Anyway, [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70919/takenoko]Takenoko[/url] plays fast (our game took around 40 minutes to end, with explanations), catches the eye (it will surely be a hit in conventions) and it is proper for family game nights (the confrontation factor is low).

Light and cute but not devoid of strategy. Interaction is mostly incidental, because you don't generally know your opponent's goals (and they're not easy to guess), but it works well as a casual but not entirely random experience.

I don't even know much about this game, other than one dude grows bamboo, and another dude comes behind you with a panda eating the bamboo you grew.  It's one of those games that makes you say "What?" when you first hear about it, but also makes you want it badly because... I mean... Pandas?!!  If this game wasn't so fun to play, and an amazing game to introduce people to these types of games with, it would be just ho-hum.  But as is, it has boosted itself into a place of greatness and is already beloved by our family after just 3 plays!!!

A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor. Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members (the players) with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden.

In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game.

RATING: 8
This is one of those games where you look at the high quality, finely executed and very cute game pieces and think "this is for kids", or at best this will be an excruciatingly light game. The comic book documentation reinforces this perception.  Once the game starts what you get is an experience that is simple enough to grasp yet takes at least 2-3 turn preplanning to play well.  Players draw random cards that act like missions and roll a die that provides a random bonus action.  However, the players, rather than chance, drive the game because the interaction of rules and components allow for planning and flexible choices to meet missions.  For example, players create the game board by placing tiles, drawing three and placing one.  The game works well and looks even better.  Play it or be a sad Panda...

There's really not a lot this game does wrong. It will not be everyone's cuppa, but... from a game production point of view: artwork, thumbing, design, clarity, components, ease of rules, elegance, replayability and mechanics, this game takes a serious amount of topping. This is my first long thought out 10 on BGG.

Takenoko is deceptively cute but packs enough strategy to rival chess. The tile placement builds a satisfying garden. Moving the gardener and panda introduce elements of offense and defense. I think this is a great as a family game.

So pretty, so little meat on this bone. Most of the strategy involves storing up 5 completed objectives and dropping them all in one swoop late in the game.

Game is pretty broken in 2 player where panda objectives are clearly the strongest route.

RATING: 8
After a single play with three adults, I feel as if this game is more suitable for kids and casual gamers than it is for regular gamers. For me, the randomness introduced by the assignment cards makes the game feel too light to be interesting. That is a shame, because this is one of the best looking games out there. As it stands, however, I would surely like to play this game again, but I do not need to own it.
UPDATE: Played the game again with my girlfriend and her daughter, and liked it better this time. I think the decision making revolves around picking the right type of task cards and deciding which ones merit pursuing, and which do not. Would like to play again. Raised my ratin to a 7.

RATING: 6
I very much wanted to like this game. Everything about this game screamed "mid-heavy Euro with amazing components". Alas, while the last part of the statement is true, the initial statement is not. While the rules feel as if the game is Euro-centric, the game somehow feels quite chaotic. The illusion of choice comes from all the actions and the weather die roll. However, I felt that all the decisions in this game were pre-programmed and from the get-go, I knew what I had to do given my bonus cards at hand. There is little doubt about the outcome of my actions except that they are solely governed by the cards at hand. I feel the lack of tension and also the lack of serious decision making.
 With two, it seems manageable. However, I would hazard a guess that with more players, the game becomes a whole lot less predictable and harder to achieve the individual goals. 
  A huge warning about this game: the variant rule MUST be used in this game regarding scoring of newly drawn cards that can score immediately upon selection without any effort. This is a game breaker here. I don't understand why the rules aren't designed to include this rule. It is ridiculous that one can score multiple cards with existing tiles/bamboo configurations without any effort whatsoever.

05/2014: After a few more plays with slightly modified rules for card draw, we are satisfied that the rules balance out each other. 
1) We can have no more than TWO similar types of objective cards per hand with a maximum total limit of 5 per hand as per the usual rule.
2) Each set of three objective cards score an additional 3 points.

RATING: 5
This game has probably suffered low ratings from some users due to the results of horribly written instructions that are literally missing huge key pieces of information that affect how strategic the game is.  Took a couple of plays to realize that there was a reason why some of the gardener cards were so valuable and some of the pattern cards much less so.  Took the game from a 5 to a 7 just figuring this out - and this information isn't even in the rules!  Not the deepest game, but fun and beautiful.

Update: That said, I just don't feel the urge to play this game that often.  While I love the thematic mechanics - Panda moves and eats, gardener moves and bamboo grows - and the sheer beauty of the game, there just isn't enough there to grab me.  I also don't think it succeeds as a gateway in the sense that it's highly replayable.  Ticket to Ride is simpler, but it's a game that beginners will want to play over and over.  Just don't see it in Takenoko.

So with that I drop my rating to a 6 and I figure it will stay there.

Update: Have played Tokaido twice so far and it's the game I wished Takenoko had been.  Yes, Tokaido is light, but at 2p it offers both a more zen-like experience AND a feeling of both theme progression (literally - you're traveling Japan) and tactical choices.  Tokaido has some critics who claim there are no choices, but that is false, at least at 2p.  Takenoko just felt so repetitive - a feeling that stripped away the beauty and otherworld zen experience of the colors and theme.  Because with both of these games, those are the major selling points.  Take that way and what you have left is so fluffy light that neither game would be worth playing.

The ridiculously cute, high-quality components are the main selling point. Fun game with a touch of strategy to discover, but it does tend to drag a little with 6yo and 9yo both playing. Each turn has two or three decisions to make that aren't always obvious so 30 secs of AP can be an issue for such a light, quick game.

RATING: 7.5
I play with the rule of draw one from each of the piles, choose the one you want, which adds a bit of game to it. Probably a 6 based purely on the game mechanics itself -- the game's not only light, but there's very few opportunities for interaction beyond capitalizing on other people's labor (whereas other gateways provide much more). I have only played 2P, but I'm not sure why things would be any different 3-4P. 
Theme really, really carries this one, though -- makes it easy to explain, and a game that everyone will want to really love. A true gateway/non-gamer/feel-good low competition game, definitely worthwhile to get if you have friends who aren't regular gamers.

I avoided this game because of the hard to figure out name and the childish looking theme of a panda in some emperor's gardens.  That was a mistake.  The game has simple to learn rules with 5 possible turn actions.  The weather dice adds a nice twist and element to the game influencing what type of objectives you can finish most efficiently.  While it was easy to learn and start playing, continued play has added layers of complexity to decision making getting used to what objectives are left to be drawn (expert mode where completed objectives cannot be picked up but you keep drawing until you get one incomplete) and the likelihood of drawing one you can complete with remaining actions in the last few turns to influence what type you pick.  The depth of strategy in the game has made me a huge fan even though luck is always a factor and can dominate a single play of the game using careful tactical decision making will yield a higher than average winrate.

Outcomes in this game are a bit more more luck dependent than my usual preference. Even at that scores often come out fairly close. 

No point in making long term plans (and I feel foiled even in mid-term plans)  It gets away with it by being cute, even though I am not particularly susceptible to cute.

Right now it's getting played at a level higher than my underlying enthusiasm.

Two plays - 3p & 4p.  It was a little harder than other games for my parents to understand.  The weather conditions are impossible for them to remember and there are a lot of things to think about each turn considering you can only take 2 actions.  Enjoyed it more the second time around once everyone had a better idea what they were doing.  Overall, I'm impressed with the depth of the game and think it was a good addition to our collection - just not as suitable for lighter gamers as I'd hoped.

When I first played this game, I was completely endeared with the adorable components and quick turns.  After purchasing the game and playing it a few more times, I found myself extremely bored and a little agitated while playing.  

The hidden goals that you're all trying to complete just take all of the gameness out of the game.  You may be screwing over other people, but you don't get the pleasure of knowing that you are.  Which makes it even more frustrating when someone messes up your plans because they don't even know they're doing it either.

I'm not one who cares much about winning, In fact I got this game specifically because it was a game not meant to be taken seriously.  I surprised myself how the end game always frustrated me as you can be SO close to winning, and just keep grabbing cards hoping for one you need to win and you can't get it.

Reminiscent of the Euros of old, with a light theme and good components paired with simple gameplay and a spice of luck.  It's got a feel that's like [gameid=12] or [gameid=11] or [gameid=94] that way.  The components are top-notch, and the panda will melt the heart of even the staunchest gamer.  The gamplay has a bit of luck to keep everybody competitive, but there's a lot of space for good play.  The best player isn't guaranteed a win, but it's more likely than the other players.

Fun, but not something I'm itching to play over and over. Rented, and probably won't buy. Got some more plays on BGA and I really dislike the end of game condition. Seems more like a race than a victory point competition. Taking your time to finish big point gardener cards seems like it will only get you 2nd or worse.

So pretty!  The rules are easy to pick up and actions are pretty intuitive based on your objective cards. I don't love the easy version where objective cards that already have their conditions met when drawn are considered complete.  It adds too much randomness to the game and seems to make the plot configuration cards OP.

This game is adorable, easy to teach and has enough fluctuating goals to chase that it is nearly impossible to do poorly, making it an amazing gateway game. I'm not really a gateway gamer though, so while I like it for what it is, it certainly isn't something that's going to see much play in my usual gaming circles. I'm glad I didn't buy into the hype train when it came out, but I'll gladly play it if it is offered up out in the wild.

Very simple to learn/teach and fun to play.  The insert that comes in the box is probably the best designed insert as it all the pieces have their own individual pockets (some even shaped as the component to better secure it).  Very high replay value.  Other than the plot tiles, all the components are small enough to be choking hazards...so keep very little kids away from this game. :)

This is a great hex laying game. I like the different paths to collecting points and that you can shift gears as the board develops. The hidden goals also makes the game more friendly as no one ever intentionally blocks you.

Nice quality components - the painted gardener and panda are quite cute.  Sadly, the game doesn't quite live up to the components.  A bit too much randomness for my taste.  The objective cards are handed out randomly and the emphasis seems to favor the panda cards as the best strategy.  The die roll also seems to add more randomness than I care for.

I do not consider this game to be the best game in the world, but it never failed to make me happy. In terms of beeing short, easy to learn, a little random good looking game, it is flawless:)

RATING: 6.5
Decent game for engaging the kids, with enough to keep the adults marginally interested. The tile distribution makes for a colourful ever-changing board as you navigate the farmer and panda around, both growing and consuming bamboo. The strategy needed to accomplish various goals is off-set modestly by a turn based die roll, that provides for random 'bonus' abilities used during one's turn. It's one we gravitate back to from time to time, but not one we generally play 'back-to-back.'

Fantastic components, great light game. Everything looks and feels so nice. Not the deepest game, but a ton of fun. I wish the Ambassador card gave you more than two points, though. Perhaps the points should be dependent on whether you went first, second, or third so as to better make up for the fact that you don't get another turn.

I've only played this once and we messed up a rule: instead of taking three tiles and choosing one, we just took the top tile which made it really hard to create the configurations for most of the scoring cards. Beyond that, it was a fun little game and one that I'd be happy to try again. I also think this game would be wonderful for families or new gamers, so I might have to try that out.

In this game players take turns completing two of five actions and a special die action trying to complete a number of goals based on the number of players. It is a simple game and is to play. Regardless, I am terrible at this game, which makes it difficult for me to enjoy. Adrienne loves it, although I suspect that may have something to do with the panda.

Played it for the first time 2 days ago. Fun game, good components. I thought I had won the game due to I finished first and got the Emperor card. After adding up the card points, my daughter won. 42-35. She got the better point cards. This is a great family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is gorgeous and relaxing. With all the tiles, though, it needs a good deal of table space. I find that players tend to forget to use their little wooden action markers (due to concentrating on the board instead of the player mat) and then lose track of what actions they've done.

Takenoko is a family game. There is a fair bit of luck involved and there aren't any deep underlying strategies. While it's not a bad game and it's balanced pretty well, it has become a success mainly because of the low threshold and the cute comic book style theme. Usually willing to play if someone in my group really wants to.

The cute little panda and the farmer wander around the three kinds of bamboo garden tiles to grow and irrigate the bamboo. The trick is that the players have secret objectives while playing cards to influence the movement and actions of the single panda and farmer. A family game that is definitely different.

Really a fun game, especially with younger players. The components are the best part - very gratifying making towers of bamboo and such. This is not a deeply strategic game.

Expand a bamboo garden using hexagonal tiles.  Grow bamboo using the farmer model.  Eat bamboo using the panda model.  Do all of these according to randomly drawn objective cards = fun.

Interesting subject. Pandas and growing bamboo. Don't let the pastel colors and subject fool you. This is a middle weight strategy game with a dose of luck thrown in. The card drawing is the luck factor. I feel it would be better if there was a drafting option instead of just a random draw but I may be wrong. Either way I think this one will appeal to many folks. Try it.

An enjoyable lighter Abstract/Euro! Of course the pieces are fantastic, but the game play is very sataisfying too.  The die roll special power makes for some nice tactical decicions and the rarely seen "draw a card then build what it shows on the board" (think MauerBauer) mechanic was a nice change of pace.  This was a must add for our collection after out first play and it is easy to get on the table when we're in the mood.

This is a fun little game that definitely shines for 3 players. I originally purchased it as my wife spent a number of years growing up in Japan and I thought she would enjoy the panda and bamboo theme.

When we are looking for a casual gaming night for just the two of us, this is one that we regularly reach for. It has an easy setup and we don't need to spend too much time reminding ourselves of the rules if it has been a while since we played it.

Though perhaps a gimmick, my wife and I love how the bamboo grows, and the gardener and panda figurines, as well as the garden tiles are really beautiful and enjoyable to look at.

Neat little game! I love Antoine Bauza's designs, and especially Tokaido, so I came in to this game knowing that there was going to be a good game with not too much complexity, but enough interaction to keep it interesting, and I was correct. I think my favorite part about the game was the die roll at the beginning of the turn, because it means that you can plan your turn out to an extent but that die roll can give you so much more to work with. The game feels very reactionary, and to it's credit, the simplicity of the design keeps it interesting because there's always that unknown factor of what action you might have for this turn.

I take this game everywhere I go to work, It is a easy game to explain and to play, however I have had mixed results with it. In general, Girls and kids love it because its cuteness and are willing to play; the first reaction of men is.. meh. It turns quite puzzly and the fun part is when it becomes a race to finish. However it is boring, it lacks this EUREKA feeling and player interaction; it becomes worst when everybody is following the easy path (panda cards) and not trying to keep in mind the scores of others and just doing one card after the other. I used to play it as trying to read other player's movements. it plays very well with any number of players and non gamer, though, but it is not for everybody. My girlfriend loves it, for me is the staple, my mother finds it very fiddly and does not have depth or interaction for my friends.

Play hex tiles, move a panda and a gardener around said hex tiles to grow and eat bamboo.

This game is SO PRETTY.  And simple (but not too simple) and quick.  I'm not sure why I didn't take to it.  The achievement cards don't feel balanced, there was one deck that I just never wanted to draw from.  But that's a minor thing.  It just didn't grab me for some reason.

Pleasant, unusual game, with delightful "bamboo" and figurines.  There's a smidgen too much luck-of-the-draw to take it too seriously, but the scoring seems sufficiently balanced to compensate.

I don't think I like it in games where you draw your goal cards from different piles. I don't like this aspect in Yedo and I don't like it here. I've only played once and I would be willing to try again, but there are so many other games I'd rather come back to.

Extremely pretty eye candy. The theme is fun, the game is a bit light, but still amusing. I play with my girlfriend most of the time, who is not a hardcore gamer, but enjoys games. It's something that we can set up fast, and both have a chance at winning. I give it an 8 since I do tend to prefer a bit heavier titles... but I do not think I would turn down a match.

Acquistato in offerta (30) Amazon il 28 agosto 2017. Da provare. Prima partita fatta il 3 settembre 2017, in tre, carino ci siamo divertiti quanto prima applicherò l'espansione. Gioco strategico, che si presenta molto bene e penso possa avvicinare tante persone al board game.

Perhaps a little heavier than Ticket to Ride, but in the same ballpark. Very cute, fairly simple game that is great fun for a wide audience. Visually stunning and garners a lot of attention and love. Objectives help to focus new players on what they should be doing.

This game is gradually growing on me and the family. Once you have played it , you start to understand the subtleties, and what I initially thought were inbalances in the cards are not really, its just a bit of a gamble working out which type of card is most likely to offer a real reward thats still possible to attain. Not difficult, but a bit of fun.

An excellent medium strategy game that would work well with a family, mostly due to gorgeous artwork, a cute theme, and plenty of tactics wrapped around solid rules. Antoine Bauza keeps knocking it out of the park for me. Not all his games are amazing, but they are rarely bad, and never stale. He's one of my favorite designers of the moment, for sure.

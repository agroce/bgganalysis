AN *EXCELLENT* drafting/bluffing/negotiation game!  It's a lot of fun to try and suss out players' relative power and accuse them.  I like how the resolution is multi-faceted - the round is far from over once someone is accused.  It's fun to play and usually provides a lot of interesting choices.

A very basic card drafter is enlivened by a couple of things.  The first is special powers from randomly dealt characters (the Guardians of the title).  The second is a vote each round on who has the highest scoring set of cards.  This is based on partial information, opening up possibilities for bluff and concealment, and rewarding those who pay close attention to the cards they are passing on.  The chosen player can accept (small penalty) or deny (chance of gaining a card or a greater loss if mistaken).  The game plays briskly and with plenty of interaction.  

The artwork is gorgeous.  The cards aren't the best quality and sleeves may be a good idea.  The English rules lack clarity on some of the Guardian powers.

Upgraded, more strategic version of Sushi Go. Plus, visually stunning (sadly, I was not able to get ot to the table enough to discover its full potential).

RATING: 6
The mechanics of the game reminds me of Age of Assasins and Sushi Go! as you draft cards and build sets like Sushi Go! but keep 2 of 3 cards hidden, which both is already in use with AoA. The only new mechanic for me are the character cards and the greed phase and the voting on the strongest player, which itself has succeeded in giving Overseer its own flavor. The theme is pulled over a rather abstract set collection, drafting and deduction game. The character cards are very beautiful but may be a bit too much sexualising for kids and people who are easily offended.
Yet I am a bit disappointed about the mostly abstract collection cards. I can understand that they shall not clash with the characters, but looking all the time on them in my hand doesnt appeal to take me into the narrative at all.

DEC16 6/10 Stars (Player Group Vote 5.5)

RATING: 4
I found the game too much luck dependent in both drafting and voting. Going for sets with green/blue is like flipping a coin. If I get a set of three then I get no satisfaction because it was not my super plan, but just a pure luck. On the other side voting and grey cards are my least fovourite type of negative interaction. I like when negative interaction is in the game, but only when it's a core mechanic. I hate games with set collection where sometimes you might get destroyed with what you've built and sometimes nothing will bother you.

I admit that I kickstarted this due to the fantastic (albeit a little pervy) art combined with a low price.  It turns out to be a fun, novel little card game.  There are some Texas Hold 'em elements as players reveal a portion  of their hands and everyone tries to sort out who has the strongest hand.  Really enjoyable.

My main criticism is the terrible printing of the money.  It's really hard to distinguish between the different denominations.

I backed Overseers on KickStarter and haven't regretted a second of it - this game is now a mainstay at game nights with my local friends. It's a very solid drafting game with elements of bluffing that complicate each round. The relatively low level of complexity means that we can introduce it to our more easily frustrated friends with no worries, while the characters' different powers spice things up a little. In short, an excellent game well deserving of a high score.

Overseers is a neat drafting game. It reminds me of Sushi Go! but it's a little bit deeper due to the way your cards are played. While it's not as new gamer friendly as Sushi Go!, I do feel as though it's a solid filler after you've gotten used to drafting games.

A bland drafting game with a bluff element which does not work that well, actually.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good game that combines drafting, bluffing, set collection, and asymmetrical powers.  It is relatively quick game.  My only huge complaint is the money (aka point scoring tokens).  They seem to all be tan or brown.  If you are color blind - you will be very disappointed.  All the money is the same size also and the font to determine the denomination is not very large and it is dark font on brown/tan which is a huge oversight.  The game is quite fun but this oversight makes me want to reduce the game from a 7.0 to a 6.5.  This can be remedied by swapping out with poker chips but you shouldn't have to. I should also say that the art work is superb and the different special god cards (aka special power cards) is also good.  Although, I should say that the gods cards which are all female are risqué and very suggestive.  Might not be suitable for kids below 14.  I did not find the powers of the god cards to be totally unbalanced.  Some gods are better than others but the game is over before you know it so it didn't bother me. I only plaid the game 2 times so perhaps it is more balanced or unbalanced and my limited plays have not proved that yet.

The art is stunning in this game. I have the Thundergryph Games edition where the components are more than awesome in quality. The cards are beautiful, UV spot is just gorgeous, the metal leader token as well and the sleeves they provide are the best I've ever seen(I sleeve all my games).
The game itself is a great bluffing game if you have more people to play with.
If you like poker and don't mind drafting you should definitely check this one out, it could replace other bluffing games in your collection.

Une petite nouveauté avec un parti pris graphique un peu osé, quoi que plutôt réussi (les plus féministes d'entre nous hurleront à l’hérésie). C'est un jeu de bluff plutôt malin où il faudra obtenir le plus de valeur de cartes, suite à un draft, mais sans que les autres joueurs soupçonnent que c'est vous qui avez le maximum. Rajoutez à cela quelques pouvoirs apportés par des personnages spéciaux et cela donne un jeu sympathique.Je pense que plus on est nombreux, plus il est intéressant.

RATING: 7
Rating based on a single play. There may not be as much agency as I would like. There isn't much control in the draft of course, and although you might want to appear strong when you are weak, or appear weak when you are strong, there is little ability to accomplish that. 

Negotiation and bluffing is key to making the game shine, but I feel like there isn't that much to discuss. Building that communication into the mechanics may have been a better way to go.

For example, if your vote was placed not with the vote marker but by ponying up coins, that would communicate how strongly you feel about the statement you are making. If your vote turned out to be accurate (you picked the high-score player) you should get a return on your wager, 2:1 or even 3:1. I hope to test that variant.

While the game does work, it is torn between wanting to be a serious point scoring card game or a vehicle for glorious artwork and fun bits. The problem is, there are too many unplanned, seemingly random effects (ie. being dealt random characters, or being punished no matter how you deal with being voted off the island), to be very strategic, leaving me to believe the look of the game took precedence over thorough play testing.

In the end, it was a fine experience, but easily forgettable a few weeks after it's release hype fades away.

Fun card game, but I think you need to play with 4 or more players. With 3 the results seem very easy to predict and force the outcome of each round, making the game a dull process of elimination.

The artwork on the character cards is occasionally edgy (sexy) but not graphic. Regardless the art is excellent.

A decent general idea for a bluffing game but needs some more refinement in the execution. The game as is doesn't really allow for either proper evaluation of the other players' holdings or for effective bluffing so guessing the highest score is as much of a lucky punch as is going for one of the high risk/high reward card combinations. I also strongly dislike some of the character powers that only negatively affect specific other players while giving no benefit at all to the player using the power.

Draft cards,they're worth various points. There's sort of a bluffing/negotiation phase where everyone tries to figure out who has the most points that round. Some cards are revealed and others aren't. The person selected is penalized if they do have most (or if they chicken out) and they are rewarded if they don't. One card lets you steal if you have the most of it. Before each round of drafting, each player gets a role card that changes the rules for them slightly. This game seems to fill a filler role once you get over the fairly shallow learning curse If you get good cards and convince everyone you have bad cards, you'll probably win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Neat card drafting game with a spin where you're trying to bluff the power of your hand each round. The overseer powers are interesting and really make you have to change up how you want to draft and what cards you want to reveal or hide.

The art is excellent and the game looks really nice. My only nitpick is that the rulebook and the cards don't match up in terms of explanations for the overseer powers.

I like the idea of bluffing by the cards you place in front of you, but you can never be sure what the others have with greater player count, so it get's kinda random and guessing into the dark.

* Kickstarted! *

Card drafting with a difference: three cards face up, two cards face down, and then players make their bets as to who is going to be strongest -- with each player's character getting a special ability to affect those cards as well. It's fairly easy to grasp, and offers decent strategy.

PLUS: theme, easy to learn, can be strategic
MINUS: not a deep game to last the majority of the night

Excellent drafting game. Great art, fantastic graphic design. Quick to pick up. Good depth without unnecessary complexity. Plays very fast as well.

Overseers was a monster to learn to play. If you stick with the game, you'll start to wish there were more character cards to keep the rounds fresh and unique. I only wish the strategy was more tight knit, and this is where the game falls slightly short. All the strategies that are available only help to a small extent and luck plays a big role in each round.

Really gorgeous artwork.  Plays quickly with the opportunity to bluff and discuss with the other players.  Varying powers keep it interesting.  Sometimes tough to decide if you want to look strong or not.  I got the deluxe version for some reason, but the metal first player marker quite nice.  The bag was worthless, though, as t does not hold anything.  Won the first game by one point, so came right down to the wire.  Three rounds goes pretty fast.

This has a lot of common Kickstarter issues.
 - Nice (but somewhat sexist) art but no theme integration.
 - A somewhat verbose rulebook that looks clear until you play and realize it is missing major information
 - A combination of mechanics that sounds unique but actually has not been thought out.  The drafting cards do not make the bluffing rules more interesting.
 - The cards are individually pretty but the information layout is a disaster.  The same goes for the money tokens -- they cannot be read at a glance.
- A naive use of otherwise solid mechanics.  E.g. they think that drafting is interesting when some cards are obviously better than anything else.  They think that guessing the winner is interesting when most of the information is hidden.  They think that set collecting is interesting when sets are worth less than individual cards.

With better info rep and rules, this would be a 3/10.  As is, it is unplayable.

+ looks nice
- game flow suffers when constantly someone is asking when this happens, what this does etc.. so much rules for short game
- idiotic drafting, do I take 6pts or 3pts... oh my..
- all coins looks similar to each other

A game that gets better each time you play it. Every game after the first gets better each time with so many ways to bluff and trick your opponents. Tons of diversity, beautiful artwork and extremely high quality components!

[Thundergryph Games 16 edition] {Mythology; card-drafting, variable-player-powers, bluffing; optimal 6p} I bought this game based on the recommendation of my game buddy.

Overseers look like a fun again.  Want to try.

The card illustration is not my cup of tea.  The colours of the tokens are too similar to be useful.

Single play, taught by someone who had already deciphered & internalised the rules, so clearly explained.

Drafting, bluff & cleavage. Elements to admire in any game, but €28 seemed a bit high.

Very surprised that I enjoyed this, as usually I don't enjoy bluffing/deduction-style games (eg. The Resistance, Coup, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, etc.). We played with 5, and I think that was a good player count.

Firstly, the quality of this game is incredible. The wooden token is great, and the card art is gorgeous. 

It's a game of bluffing and deceit, where you compete to have the highest score without being voted on as having the highest score.

Your mileage in this game is really going to come down to what type of people you play with, as most of the fun I've had is in the debates about your scoring. As someone who plays a lot of commander in magic, in my playgroup we had a lot of fun arguing and making deals to gang up on people whilst trying to maintain our advantage.

I think that's where this game shines, as when I played with my family who are not into board games, it fell a little flat as the intense politicking wasn't there.

The actual mechanics are pretty simple, based on getting sets of cards. The overseers have abilities that trigger at various stages of the round, to try and mess over others. There are no abilities that help you, instead focusing on disrupting the other players. Again, with my playgroup this fits into our play style, but could be off putting for players who don't like that level of internal politics in their games.

I have really enjoyed this game. It often gets pulled out to end a commander session, and the grudges often get carried over various sessions. Recommend if your the type of player who enjoys politics, but probably not something to play with less experienced players.

I really enjoy this game. You need to have 4+ people imo, but if you enjoy a little bit of debate in your game it's damn fun. The learning curve is a little steep but after 2 hands I feel everyone understands exactly how the game works. 
There's some advanced ideas that come out the more you play it.
It certainly has a texas hold 'em vibe of bluffing.

Interesting supplement of negotiation/deception added to a card drafting game. The artwork is definitely eye-catching, but I wonder if the choice in art style will be a net positive.

played it with 4 players. It's a very interesting twist on sushi go. You don't only draft cards, you then proceed by discussing you has the highest score.
That is very very cool, I really enjoyed it a lot

Sushi Go plus guessing and bluffing. It feels like good play gets punished though, which is very demotivating. Another point off for sexist artwork.

I like card games and I like drafting by passing hands, but the interesting thing here is the voting on who has the highest score: besides helping to reduce the imbalance between the lucky and the unlucky, it also adds a social aspect of bluff and suasion.

Sushi Go card drafting and set collection with bluffing/group persuasion. Beautiful art and components but that's about it (for me).

Black-jack meets Poker, with a drafting element;
Not a bad filler game, might be a Good One.
Some of the art pushes the line; rather than Anime meets Mucha,
more Anime meets Goya.

Good game, well designed and tactical. The theme is really tacked on to justify the beautiful art and that may be why the immersion is not really there - that little something is missing to make it a great game

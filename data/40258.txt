The Buffalo Wings rules (which can be used with all Fighting Wings games) are streamlined enough for quicker play than full rules or even quick start rules.  The rule changes don't detract too much from the fun

For a novice like me, this is a better game than Over the Reich because it's easier. For enthusiasts, it's a worse game for the same reason (I imagine). Fun to play once a decade or so, but I'm not willing to put in the time to really explore this.

I have been looking forward to this addition to the FW series for a long time and have not been disappointed. I have played 6 of the scenarios and the mix of situations and aircraft is very interesting, as were the articles in ATO. 

JD continuously supports his games, so it's easy getting questions answered. Steve at ATO is great on customer service, so it was nice to see ATO was the magazine that published BW.

I have used the full FW rules for my play, but the game can of course use the intro rules that came with it, or the "intermediate" Quickstart rules JD published online.

All in all a very nice addition while awaiting Wings Over the Motherland.

Really like this game. It's a great entry to the Fighting Wings series, and it helped me get comfortable with the rules' foundations while still having lots of fun. And the subject matter - air combat during the Russo-Finnish War - is both interesting and largely overlooked. Really glad I have it...and NO, it isn't up for trade or sale!

Real Good game about air to air combat. Good introduction to the Fighting Wings Series, quick to understand and really helps you in the series.

I give it a 8, because I'd give a 9 to the QS system and a 10 to the Full Rules Serie.

I picked this up at Historicon and it reignited my love of air combat games.  After playing around with it, I found it to be "just right," in that one actually has to practice flying the various aircraft to be "good" at the game.  Flying mistakes will be made by rookies (me) and that's what's fun about this type of system vs. making mistakes with rules that cause issues.  That said, the rules are intuitive and not overlly complex, and for a hex and counter game, the graphics are wonderful.

Shortly after playing around with Buffalo Wings, Whistling Death joined the ranks of my gaming collection.

Now, for the conversion to miniatures... :D

RATING: 6
a perfect way to start playing Fighting Wings, and a good game in it's own right.

excellent articles, a playable game, and scenarios and ADCs that are compatible with Fighting Wings.

rating is a recent downgrade of all complicated air combat games.  I have had an epiphany that for all the mental overhead, they just aren't that fun to play and it is too difficult to find opponents.  Many of the games just end up being indecisive turn-fests, or won by a lucky shot/initiative die-roll.

RATING: 8
Outstanding set of 3D air combat rules in just a few pages. There is enough record keeping (in writing on sheets) that a player won't control more than a couple planes but once I got how much fun BW is that limitation really didn't matter. It also didn't matter that the aircraft in BW are Finnish and Russian clunkers that are far removed from Hellcats or Fw-190s, the plays the thing and the play is great.

I'm the designer - and this was my first look at this finished product, many, many months after handing off to developer Lembit Tohver and ATO for publication. I recently played it three times at Origins - fun and fast compared to the regular Fighting Wings Rules. However, less maneuver options obviously, than the full rules. For which I give it a lower rating. BTW the production quality is outstanding. Maps and counters are nice and go together well. Rules read nice and Lembit did a super job with them. 

Clean rules, with very little errata or typos noted. What I've find so far is very minor and does not affect game play at all. The magazine itself has some good support articles for the whole theme, several written by myself so I'll leave you guys to judge it.

All in all, I'm happy with it, and it certainly rates a 9+ for good looks and components.

Cheers,

JD

This game represents a truly impressive distillation of the essential elements of the Fighting Wings system into a very compact and accessible package--and it's a subject that I find very appealing.  Tremendous historical richness, as usual from the designer, gorgeous aircraft counter art from Ian Wedge, and a very appealing map.

RATING: 5
One play, with the experienced teacher leading me and one other player through the paces.  The cool part of this system is the variability and the detail covered in all the various airplanes modeled.  

Rates of climb, top speed, banking flexibility, firepower, etc.  There are a lot of details embedded into the system.

This amount of detail makes for a bit of a barrier to entry.  My heart quailed when I learned this was the introductory level and two other more complex systems follow on to this system.

I can see how this might provide fascination, especially to aeronautic geeks.  But I found the game itself a bit slow.  I realize the game should speed up with more experience.  However, I don't see a lot of opportunities to play this in my future, and I have an extensive list of 2p games that I would turn to first.

A nice small expansion of the Fighting Wings system in terms of aircraft and scenarios, with an introductory ruleset that doesn't interest me much personally as I'm already experienced with the system.  High-quality components and 14 scenarios.

RATING: 6
Best of the tactical air combat systems, entry much facilitated by the intricate but excellent quick start rules.  Basically meant that I could dive right into it without having to read the rules in this game.

Taken down two notches by a map that is beautiful but essentially unuseable if you want to note down hex coordinates as is quite usual with this series, due to the hex coordinates (gray on green!!) blending near perfectly into the background. Black mark for the map graphics designer.

BW is a complete wargame: beginners can find simple rules to start learning the ropes of aerial combat. They can stick with it and buy the other games of the serie to get more aircraft and still use BW rules.
If they are hooked they can upgrade to the Quick Start rules adn then to the Full Rules making the learning curve acceptable.
And if you are already a veteran of the Fighting Wings serie then you can get cool planes and cool scenarios.
Add nice material and comparatively cheap price, BW is a great game.
One problem though: the rules for air-to-ground combat are not included. My rating is only for air-to-air combat.

Great addition to the Fighting Wings series. The basic rules take out some of the detail and make the game play a bit faster, but at the expense of some of the realistic feeel.  However, the scenarios and plane cards all work with the full rules and are GREAT!

Nice introduction to the Fighting Wings serie. The rules are really simple, only 10 pages, but the beauty of the system is that it uses the same mechanisms as the full game serie and both the aircraft data cards and the scenarios ( 20 of them) are compatible with Fighting Wings.

Bought this because of my interest in the Brewster fighter plane, and the fact that I was looking for something along the lines of an update to the old air Force/Dauntless games.  Rules look good, but just a bit intimidating.  Haven't played yet, though there appears to be avery active online community actively supporting this game (and the other Fighting Wings titles).

I hope these simplified rules (think ASL SK) will encourage new players to delve into the FW system and the full 1.0 rules found in Achtung Spitfire! I cannot see any of my gaming associates ever attempting the new, more complex, 2.0 rules found in Whistling Death (much less the next 3.0). The game can be played quite fast once the bookkeeping becomes second nature. However, AP can really drag this down in face-to-face play.

The scenarios and components score a 9, as with Over the Reich and Achtung Spitfire!. The additional +1 is for the rules that allow these components to be used and these scenarios to be played (although the rules and especially the play-aids could use a little more editing) The beautiful map is very difficult to use for new players with the muted hex vertices and very small hex numbers (form overriding function).

The 'horizontal' training scenarios make clear which AC should turn and fight and which should just run. (And reasonably fair 1 vs 1 fights may come down to just low odds luck-of-the-dice combat rolls.)

Scenario 16.2 is grossly unbalanced against the Soviets. They would need to win most initiative rolls and have vastly superior combat DR to win (i.e. flat out luck).

Scenario 16.3 has AC equal in performance but the Finnish Fiat G.50 is hopelessly outgunned. Playing for a draw is the only choice.

I use 'incremental odds' and Pythagorean distances for the vertical/horizontal spaces (the suggested method of the greater + 1/2 the lesser of the FP in WD overestimates the range by 1 in almost every instance, the BW rules increase this 'error'). We also use the standard banking rules (requiring zero added effort and are actually simpler to understand that the written rule) but still no inverted flight.

Note: Section 10
Turn 1 Finn: 'gaining 3 accel'
'Net decel = 3 -(6+9+2) = -14'
'the 4 remaining decel'
Turn 2 Finn: 'and 3 power points'
delete '(not idle though)'
'as follows: 3 engine power'
'transition for 6 decel + the 4 decel'
''decel penalty) = 8-16 = -8'
'no half FP and -3 decel carry'

The corresponding corrections need to be made on the flight log (coming to the same final result).

A complete clean-up rewrite of the rules is needed to really make them useful for new players of this system: e.g. Several scenarios denote situations where 'no collision' will occur but there are no collision rules anyway, Play-aids list Gun Harmony modifiers but no rules, Engine Seize Critical Hit but no gliding rules (just Idle 0.5 speed loss & Overspeed Decel), WIA effects on pilot/gunner (other than 2nd WIA = KIA), does the +15 Severe damage modifier affect all guns ...

Other errors and corrections are noted on the BGG game page. I consider this a failure of development as an introduction to the FW game system should be nearly flawless.

My first ATO game, but I have all of the other FW games already. I like FW and have no problems with the complexity (though I still make big mistakes) so I was a little unsure whether I would like the simplified rules. To be honest I got a little frustrated that some maneuvres cannot be done (there is no inverted flying for example) but I soon got past that and got on with what is a good, relatively simple and clean game. It has got my mate back to FW which is great. I also intend to use the simple rules (without any options) to teach my 7 year old son the game. Oh and to top it all the graphics and production values are very high.

Played this game before I purchased it and enjoyed it. I have since purchased it and read the rules. It seems to be an excellent introduction into the game system, presenting the feel of the full game without the complete complexity and features of the full game.

The components are very nice, with the map being close to excellent. If the hex numbers were easier to see it would be excellent. The counters are very nicely done and there seem to be enough of them, including counters that will not come into play unless doing some full rules air to ground scenarios.

I would rate this game a 5 or 6, but I don't think that would be fair. I find it intriguing, but it just doesn't interest me enough to become engrossed in the game. I played with a couple of players that were passionate about it and I think all my enjoyment during the game was because of them. The movement and positioning just happen too slowly for my tastes, it kind of feels like a game of chess.

Prefer the main Fighting Wings rules to any stripped down rules.  Buffalo Wings though is a great package for new players interested in the game system. Great artwork on map and counter art is outstanding plus the game provides a good overview of the Finnish/Russian portion of WW2 in the air.

Great looking game, with very nice looking counters and map. Easy to learn and understand.

If you have always wanted to get into the Fighting Wings series of WW2 Air Combat, but were daunted by the complex rules, then this is the perfect starting point for you. Short, easy to play rules will have you up and flying in no time.

After you have gotten comfortable with this game, moving on to the Quick Start Rules and the full 2.0 Rules will be much easier to handle.

Whistling Death's simpler little brother. It is much easier to teach and is simple enough that I don't feel like I have to always do 1v1 dogfights if playing in person. If you want to introduce someone to Fighting Wings, this is the game to start them on.

That said, I miss some of the more advanced rules. My friend and I have agreed that Buffalo Wings will be our in person game and Whistling Death can be our month-long Vassal game.

First, this game looks a little bit complicated to me.
But, after 3 times reading the rule and making my own digest rule, it became much easier.

GAME: ConHex
RANK: 3380
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
ConHex can be seen as a distant variation of Gomoku except for that instead of claiming a space on the board by placing a stone directly on it, the stones are placed around the space. The first player to secure the majority around a space claims it. Then you are just fighting over the neighbouring spaces in an attempt to connect the two opposite ends of the board.
 
The starting player has a huge advantage in this since the first player to achieve the majority instantly claims the space and the majority cannot be challenged afterwards. There is no compensation for going second., and you can hope for a tie at best unless the other player makes an obvious mistake. In four words, this game is turd.

RATING: 9
An excellent connection game where you are trying to gain majority spaces around each square or hex in order to control it.  A bit like GO in that if you see you can take control of an area, you don't need to play a stone around it until your opponent does.

Intricate 2-player abstract strategy, I love playing on Yucata.de. Now I want the real version.

This is not your standard connection game. The way the vertices indirectly control the fields leads to some surprisingly distant influence, giving it a Go-like feel.

As far as connection games go, this is one of my favorites. The idea of owning cells based on the smaller pips is very interesting. The shape of the board allows for comebacks and is not too big overall. A very fun game.

RATING: 10
A great area majority/connection game.  Each possible move bears on three areas, except in the key corners and center, which effectively make those areas more expensive.   The game is dead simple, yet the multiple implications of each move make the strategy quite complex.   One of the best connection games, along with Hex, Twixt and Y.

A nice tweak on Hex where cells are claimed via corner majorities. The extra level of indirection adds some nice spice to the dry Hex mix.

Still early in my exploration of Conhex. Area control, connection, and zones of influence. A nice package. Worried that it may be solvable, but for now very smitten.

Homemade board printed on scrap manilla folder cardstock, though online play at yucata gives a better view of the board than does physical play.

I'm wondering if this is just literalizing something that's going on in every connection game-- you can start committing to a section of the board, and then later take uncontestable control. But it's a satisfying bit of business to conduct even if it were just window-dressing (which I'm not sure it is).

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2011)

ConHex is a very simple game rules wise, however it has a surprising and satisfying depth. Every move counts and it is great as you try to outwit your opponent. 

The first player does have an advantage but I play with the rule that the second player can appropriate the first players' move, so the game has zero luck and it is pure skill.

Bottom line, a good connection game. I would like to buy it. I'm downgrading its rating because nowadays I rate much harsher than in 2011. Still a good game I would like to play often.

Current Rating: 6.5

After a long time, I’m downgrading ConHex´s rating again. I still consider it an ok game and I would play it if requested, however,, my desire to play the game is low. I still enjoy it though.

I am not a fan of abstract games but this one captured my attention immediately and held it. It is simple enough that I am was able to think tactically on my first play and it went so quickly that I was happy to play two other games immediately. I am not yet sure how deep the game is and how quickly, if ever, moves would become obvious.

Every move needs to be precise. The game slowly squeezes you out of winning. Very methodical game that is missing that one feature in most great abstracts: the fuzzy thinking, intuition. What I really dislike about this game is that in the hands of two skilled players, it locks one out early, and all that fun positioning of the plates is foregone by an early surrender.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nice game where you are trying to connect two sides of the board by gaining majorities of different sections.  Once you place the required 2 or 3 pieces around a section you conquer it.  Of course most of the placements are within intersections of 2 or 3 sections making for some interesting decisions.  Not sure how strong the first player advantage is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An interesting change of pace from Hex or Y. It's Hex on a square board, but as long as the cells meet in threes the overall shape is unimportant. Uses the 'Noc' metarule described in Cameron Browne's [gameid=17821]. Interest dwindling after second play.

...oh, you know, strike that - I've played about 50 times since that comment (online) and as I pick up new tactics, it's keeping my interest. Board is too small, which skews the game towards tactical, and unlike most connection games, the center is less powerful, which I'm not crazy about. (It means that almost every first move is swappable.) But I'm still playing.

Conhex is an original and elegant connection game. The board is just big enough so that the game has strategic depth. Although the object of the game is to connect two sides, the game has an interesting circling momentum to it. The set is very attractive. If you like connection games, this is one you must check out!

And yet another one of these combinations so natural that you wonder how nobody had come up with it before - ConHex is a connection game where the areas on the board that you need to connect are conquered by filling the majority of fields around it. 

The majority aspect is here surrogate to the connection game - nevertheless it adds a completely different flavour to it. The gameplay gains urgency since single fields belong to two or three areas of the board - in stark contrast to other connection games, ConHex doesn't encourage at all occupying fields rather close to each other. This stresses even more the importance of having the initiative in certain areas of the board.

Overall ConHex is not as staggeringly deep as other classics in its genre (connection games I mean... Hex, Twixt, Havannah, Y and so on), but it's definitely more accessible - it takes less to play it and not being as tiring it turns up to be just as replayable as them if not more.

Really short and fun connection game (like Hex) that offers an interesting twist: you use small counters to "bid" on the tiles that will form your connections. Solid game that I play on littlegolem.net.

Clemens Gerhards version, purchased at Essen 2012.

Very accessible connection game. Not as deep as other connection games probably because the board is quite small in comparison.

My only small complaint about the Clemens Gerhards version is it uses tiny balls, which of course can be easily lost. I would have preferred pegs.

Interesting connection game. We played the wooden version several times at Essen 2011 and enjoyed it, but felt it wouldn't have staying power with us.

It's also a bit aesthetically awkward/unattractive that you mark control of the variously shaped regions with rectangular markers, and that the vertex markers are little balls that roll away too easily.

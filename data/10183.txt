GAME: Napoleon at Leipzig
RANK: 3064

RATING: 9
After playing "Napoleon's Last Battles" and trying to improve the rules, I found the old OSG-game "Napoleon at Leipzig" (NaL - 1st Edition!). This one brought the first interesting flavour to the old SPI game by using cavalry-attack specialities and more command rules. Nice touches to a very good Kevin Zucker game: "Hail to the Chief"...If you want to get a little further, try Markus Stumptner's refit: a new rule-variant. All for the game (rules, new counters, markers, etc.) at: Awaiting Markus Stumptner's refit for his rule sequence. So check at: http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/user/mst/games/lbn/lbn.html#refits. Thereafter I bought the COA-edition, too. Just for the nice map :-) -- UNFORTUNATELY...

The "downgrade" for a pure "9" only is just for the many mistakes in spelling German town names and terrain features wrong. 

--> Look for NaL, 5th Edition; all is set on this absolutly stunnishing map!

Have the OSG and COA versions. Slightly more advanced than NLB system. Readily playable.

Rating on OSG 1st Edn.

Enjoyed this one a lot. Map was different to others of the era as the woods were shown in autumn tones and a lot of colour for the various nationalities, along with excerpted Petre chapters in the study folder.

June 2016- Playing a solo campaign using 1st Edn counters and maps ( as the formations are easy to distinguish) and using 3rd Edn rules which clarify some of the rules. Not using Grand Tactical for this run through.

Top wargame. Best of the system is the Napoleon at Leipzig game which was published by Clash of Arms with BEAUTIFUL components. But more chrome was added. Cavarly charges, the Commanders characters come into play etc... I would give Napoleon at Leipzig a 10, but NLB gets a decent 9. OK there are NO lines or squares etc, but this is an operational level and from this angle it let you make important decisions. 
Components are superb ! A jewell, but not known to many.

A nice plus up of the basic Nap at Waterloo system.  I have the COA reissue, with an excellent, rich-looking fall inflected Barber map, and the classic/retro excellent unit counters as well.  Graphically gorgeous.  The rules remain simple, with some tiered command augmentation, and it has a lot to offer.  I've played 3 full campaign games, and have not yet won as the French.  Given the historical situation, I am fine with this, but gamewise, I wish I could get them to hold out a day or so longer before their army hits disintegration level, just for the sake of maintaining more tension.

RATING: 9
This is a hell of a game. Sure, the base system has a 70s 'look and feel', and the CRT seems crude. But it works well in practice, with the simple systems combining well with the sheer heft of this grand affair to capture the slow grind of the Coalition advance and the to-and-fro of the battles over the key landmarks. The command rules and a smattering of chrome give it a suitably chaotic feel, although I would like to try the latest edition with the cards. The bright counters and garish (and in parts unreadable) map look odd to start but actually work very well and add to the sense of history. Enjoy with volume II of Leggiere's opus on the campaign and you will get a true taste of this Battle of Nations

Good game with classic sticky ZOCs and bloodless CRT.  Surround and force a retreat.  Theses are the mechanics I grew up with and I still enjoy them, though they can be "gamey" (i.e. a line of "every other hex" is stronger than a contingous one.)  See my review of Napoleon at Eylau for a discussion of why that is.

I have the 3rd edition from COA. This game is attractive and very scalable. There are 3 ways to play, none of which are terribly complex by wargaming standards: standard rules (complexity about 2.5 or 3 /10), campaign rules (4 / 10), and grand tactical (4.5 / 10). 

Too bad that setup is such a pain. Identifying the units of all the various nationalities based on counter colors, belts, corps designation would be okay if there weren't 20  combinations of the above. I made some notes after the first setup, and next time it will be much easier. 

The map is a work of art. Rick Barber does it again! It is a little darker and more cluttered than most Barber maps, probably due to the scale and terrain, but I didn't mind this aspect. Some folks have complained that setup is impeded due to the artwork obliterating the hex numbers. I didn't have this problem. It's true that you can't see the numbers on every single hex, but you can see enough of them to tell what's what. This aspect of setup wasn't nearly as annoying as figuring out which units are which. 

The counters are also very nice, but calling them "state of the art" may be stretching it a bit. Unfortunately, they are not printed in the same quality on the back side (fewer colors, no metallics), and this can hinder unit I.D. a bit during the game. Also, the printing seemed to be off on some of mine, so that the numbers were printed over black and didn't show up, and certain red lines were offset from where they should have appeared on the counter. Not a big deal though, since the counters are so lovely and otherwise very functional.

Overall, I really like this game and this system. The scalable rules aspect means it's a good choice for introducing your non-grognard friends to Napoleonic wargaming. Gameplay is of the classic hard ZOC/ ratio based CRT type, with combat mostly resulting in AR or DR. Units have a single step and are eliminated mainly by being forced to retreat into eZOC. Therefore, maintaining a line and protecting your flanks becomes of utmost importance. 

As you add the more complex rules in the campaign and grand tactical games, the water begins to get more and more murky... but these gray areas in the rules (specifically, how certain rules interact with other rules) can be dealt with via house rulings, or a quick email to the designer.

RATING: 8
This is the ultimate Napoleon's Last Battles game, the battle of nations 1813. The French are in the centre (near Leipzig), with the Allies closing in around them from all sides. And you can have it all, from the largest cavalry engagement of the Napoleonic wars around Liebertwolkwitz, through the battles around Mockern to the final day's combat, when an overeager engineer prematurely blew the last bridge out of Leipzig (that's when you finally lose that Leipzig hex to the stubborn Prussians). The only thing missing is the drowning of Marshal Poniatowski trying to swim the river Elster, but the rest is all there.
I played this game until the cardboard units groaned and have lost and won in almost every conceivable manner. How about the Austrians coming up between the rivers and gaining acces in the French rear that way? How about Blucher's Prussians battering their way into Leipzig on day one? Just stack up these guys, with double artillery to the rear and blast away! And some games were so closely matched that it neede the intervention of the Swedes to be decided (I always play the historical Bernadotte, no Swedish combat unit is engaged until every Prussian is done for).
Break out the game right away and let's get going!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An exceptional wargame.  The Command and Control of units is done brilliantly.  This is one of those few games that puts you in the middle of a huge Napoleonic battle, gives you dozens of Corps broken down to Regimental level, but works seamlessly and allows you to savour the smaller actions.  If you like the period track this one down.  Best played with 4 players (2 per side) and start on the 16th.

Favorite Operational Napoleonic game that is simple enough to dive into. The (Clash of Arms edition) map is beautifully rendered in fall foliage, and the units are nicely represented. It's a tough battle for the French, but challenging. The best part is the challenge of moving your troops from battle location to another location- very frantic.

On the down side:
-Functionalty map / counters: the map colors and counter colors make for a rainbow look that is not so clear at times.

Napoleon, Leipzig, Kevin Zucker. Enough said. The system is very simple but works fine. Beautiful map. The nice thing is that you can play multiplayer. Ensure time, space and preferably more players. 

Revisited: very beautiful and appealing game and a comprehensive system but the battle of Leipzig is not so interesting to me and I have had no time to really play it.

Sold it.

(and also a lot of riding with your commanders...)

RATING: 7
An adaptation of the Napoleon's Last Battles system, designed for the climactic three days of the campaign of Ligny and Waterloo, to the three days of the Battle of Leipzig.

It fits pretty well. Napoleon at Leipzig includes more historical info that Napoleon's Last Battles, and my rating reflects this. But it suffers from the lack of small single-map scenarios. Unless we have the time and space for larger mini-monster games, it's just not playable. Napoleon at Leipzig also includes variant rules adding to the command system, and adding new options for the cavalry and artillery. But in my opinion the combat results table is buggy, and the combination of stacking and strong zones of control can be buggy during delaying actions.

To manage an army of La Grande Armee's size was a complex task worthy a Napoloen and it is reflected in this game. However, those willing to dig into details will experience the challenges of maneuvering armies to the right place at the right time. One campaign game saw the Allied army going from near annihilation to a break-through into Leipzig at the very last and dramatic hour. 

Pros: Feeling of managing an army with many challenges reflected, high level of player interaction, all players participate to the end, several strategic options, historic base
Cons: Complex rules, long game sessions

Since 1979 I've owned every edition of this game.

A nice blend of complexity and playability at the operational level. It is large but not a "monster". It also manages to capture the spirit of a Napoleonic battle without tactical details. I've played this with both inexperienced players and grognards and both enjoyed it equally. That is surely a testament to a finely designed game.

CoA 1996 Edition.

Played with the NLB system: Very old-fashioned, indeed!

The lack of Command Control is simulated through Initiative rolls: As your high-level Commanders cannot activate everything, you inevitably end up with units inadequately placed on the map... Those units are going to fall prey to your opponent!

Do not hope for high-odds combats here - at start, anyway - because the system favors advances and retreats... With luck, some low-odds attacks can create gaps in the enemy line that can be exploited later... If you do roll well for your Initiative (or are directly commanded) and your opponent doesn't (or isn't)... Then, you can encircle units unable to maneuverer and effectively destroy them... But it is never a done deal!

The system is not bad, but it shows its age and some players [not me] do not enjoy this "slow" approach of the battlefield: They need more direct and immediate results in combat: Understand casualties and step losses!

So, why my relatively low rating?

First, the map is not bad, but not "exceptional" either: It is rather "busy"... My main problem with it is the difficulty reading the hex numbers! When you add the completely inadequate setup layout, you understand why setting up the campaign game is a real pain:

The "Order of Battle" is interesting for historical flavor but should have been completely separated from the setup: You search for a unit and the first name referenced is not the one on the counter: Check the second name... When you go to the next unit, you find it is on the same hex: Units, with their counter designation, should have been referenced per setup hex!

Some counters of opposite armies have very similar colors: Uniforms on counters give flavor but may be confusing! Because I paid attention, I didn't confuse units of different sides, but my opponent did: He even moved several of my stacks by mistake when I left him for a few minutes!

Last point: I am completely puzzled by the charge rules: At best, you have one chance on three to lose your cavalry units... And this loss is PERMANENT (meaning no reorganization) as your cavalry units are supposed encircled by enemy ZOCs when they fail their charge while entering the enemy hex... At this rate your Cavalry Corps are going to disappear FAST!  

I hope I will find someone to play this game with the NLC system...

Guess what? I vote for a New Edition (Game, in fact) on this subject: New maps, new counters, new layout... and NEW RULES!

COA 3d Edition.

Counters and map are fantastic.  Rules are very clear and allows for increasing levels of complexity.  Even the 'most complex' is pretty easy to play as it mainly adds flavor to the command and control of the armies (highly recommended to get the taste of the full game).

The system makes you consider maneuver as every bit as important as odds during battle as the quickest way to kill the enemy is give him no space to retreat unless you intend to constantly risk your cavalry in charges.

Downsides are the amount of time necessary to play the campaign and what can be a CRT that gives you a high level of 'bloodless' combat results (lots of pushing back and forth as opposed to units breaking down and suffering from attrition).


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
This review is based on the 1st edition of this game and centres around play of the Leibertwolkwitz scenario.  Napoleon at Leipzig was designed by Kevin Zucker and deals with the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars, otherwise known as the Battle of the Nations.  Spread over 2 standard size maps the players take the roles of the French against the Allied Army.

The rules are quite straight forward especially the standard game rules.  The game uses a classic Igo-Ugo system with the Allied player moving then fighting combat and then the French player does the same.  Sides can only stack 2 units to a hex at the most, and this ensures that the armies cover a lot of territory.

The next level of rules adds commanders to the mix.  This is when things start to get interesting.  Players now have to deal with a command hierarchy, with an overall commander who issues commands to subordinates.  Each leader has an engagement rating which equates to the number of subordinate officers and units they can directly command.  (So a rating of 3 means 3 commanders and 3 units.)  There is also a rule for command range which a unit must be within in order to be considered in command.  Also units need to be in command to be able to enter an enemy zone of control.

The campaign game also adds rules for reorganization and demoralization to model the effect of combat on large units as they slowly lose cohesion.  There is also a special cavalry charge rule to try and reflect the effect of cavalry charging enemy formations.  (Surprise, surprise!)

There is a third level of rules called the Grand Tactical Game.  These rules add a further level of detail to the command rules with variable engagement ratings for the Allied leaders making it a real pain to get troops moving.  Even the French leaders, except Napoleon, are given some handicaps.  The French player also has to issue orders to his sub-commanders Murat and Ney.  There are also some other rules but as I didn’t use the Grand Tactical Game rules I won’t comment on them.

The physical quality of the game isn’t too bad for a game published in 1979.  The map is clear and the terrain is easy to see.  The counters are colourful, hence the title, though some are a little too colourful.  Most of the counters are easy to read with one exception, the Imperial Guard.  Coloured purple with yellow superior unit designation the movement and combat strength numbers are in black and almost impossible to read and impossible to read at a glance, this is quite a bad design flaw.  The rest of the units are fine with counters representing the French, blue with red designations; Italians, grey with red designations; Germans, grey-green with blue designations; and the Poles, red with blue designations.  The Allied units are represented by counters depicting the Russians, green with yellow designations; Austrians, white with red designations; Swedes, yellow with blue designations; and Prussians, blue-grey with blue designations.  When set up, and I set up the campaign game just to see what it looked like, all the different counters give a feel for the various colourful uniforms the soldiers would have been wearing.  Sure they’re not as detailed as a La Bat. game counter but it still gives a good impression none the less.

There are 3 scenarios and the campaign game, with the campaign being the meat and potatoes of this game.  When the campaign is set up there are a lot of counters to move around and the added command rules really give the feel for two armies that were too large for the command structure.  This is what Zucker states in his introduction is an aim of this game.

Overall I enjoyed playing a scenario from this game.  I was unable to replicate the historical result, and found it hard as the Allied player to shift the French from the towns, but maybe more familiarity with the system would change that.  I’m pleased I own this game and look forward to giving the campaign a shot sometime in the future.

Only playing with Markus Stumptner's variant rules. Great situation, difficult for the French to win if played with Markus' rules and order system.

Played a short scenario using Markus Stumptner's LCN rules -- very interesting.  Would definitely like to give the whole thing a go.

Already a Napoleon's Last Battle fan, it didn't take much to like this one once I finally found a copy - especially with Mr Sumptner's variations applied.

I have to say, the first edition's almost as ugly as it gets.  I keep looking at the green contour level and thinking forests and the yellow forests and thinking rough.  The counters are very difficult for me to read.

I finally acquired a DG third edition with the Barber map and those uniform colored counters that I love in Armee du Nord, but it's still a very difficult game for me visually.  If I can find a place to set up a game for a while and play it through, we'll see if my aging eyes will be able to deal with it.

I managed to get the deluxe editions of this now out of print game. The counters and map are artisitc. The game can be played with varying complexity and play time (suited for beginners [b]and[/b] grognards). The game also includes an extensive battle report.

This is the first game I played which features so-called traditional wargame mechanisms (mandatory combat, interlocking ZOCs, etc.), but I like it!

Let's not be shy here - this is simply a classic game.

I have played a small scenario for several hours, and a large scenario for several days (at CSWX 2010). The whole package holds together remarkably well, and with 2 maps this game is a very playable mini-monster.

A big, dumb and fun monster. We're enjoying it quite a bit, though I'd go without the rules that allow the French player to pick a command level for Murat and Ney.

Good game, but French are tough to beat. A bit more to it than NLB, less scripted, with better graphics.

Some of the best looking counters anywhere when it came out and still nice by today's standards.  Uses the Napoleon's last battles system.  Can be a bit long for my tastes these days, but still good.

I LOVE THIS GAME!  The system is simply outstanding.  The game rules are relatively simple and plays smooth.  The maps and counters are beautiful.  The game is surprisingly balanced, fun, and action packed.

The NLB system is getting old - the retreat based CRTs of the time just do not cut it. Next time, the Stumptner Variations will be used.

FEB 2013 - Preordered 5th Edition.

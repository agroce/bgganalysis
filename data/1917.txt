one of the best strategy games around and my personal favorite boardgame. world competitions are held around this game, which is testament to it's solid game mechanics. you can become better at this as you develop better strategies.

I like this so much more than chess, for it's theme and the need to make up your own formations at the start of every game.

This was my favorite game when I was growing up. I suspect it has not aged well, but I still admire it as the game that got me into strategy games.

I loved it when I first played it. Years later I bought a travel version and played it several times. But what happens with Stratego as you start understanding it better, is that the strategy gets more and more defensive, and analysis takes more and more time. In the end, a captain decided the outcome of the game (whith all higher ranking pieces being traded off), and this was when the game suddenly wasn't fun anymore.

RATING: 9.2
Awefully underrated abstract.  Very much a game of skill, not luck, despite being an Ameri-massmarket game.  Has a very strong memory component, which I guess a lot do not like.  This game changes after you have played against someone several times....you start to get the 'feel' for how they hide and play, and it becomes a battle of wits, trying to step outside your comfort zone and do something different, while trying to see if they have changed.  Great the first or fiftieth time you play against a single opponent.

Watch out for different versions of the game....some of them have special powers that unbalance the game.  The best versions have 40 players per side, and the most powerful piece is the 1.  If you have less than 40 pieces per side, you do not have quite enough room for clever flag/bomb concealment.  For most of my childhood, this was my favorite game.  Supplanted by AT games now, but still great fun, when I can find an opponent.

Rating is from middle school.
I played a few games during chess class lunchtimes. I don't care that the chess people say Bughouse and Stratego are for plebs. Yes, I'm a subpar chess player. I am not a strategist. I'd rather have fun. This is the game that told me, "It is okay to enjoy stupid things. Don't be afraid to explore." There is a Chinese version of this game, LuZhanQi. It's funny, because my family raised me on chess, and only later showed me their childhood games, LuZhanQi (Chinese Army Chess) and Go.

The classic strategy game that it's being outdated. I won't say no to a game but still it's not even close to chess which I adore!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The main drawback of the game is the long solitary set-up phase of the game. But the strategy involved in setting up the board set up my strategic thinking for many later games. The other drawback is that random guess plays a large role in who wins. If one of you starts attacking the correct side first they are more likely to win. Of course if one player loses their top pieces early it can also lead to a long slog waiting for an inevitable victory.

The simplicity of the rules and moves is a huge plus, and the suspense of turning the piece over to determine a winner means the game stays exciting throughout. Also a plus that there is no "pure luck" elements of the game. Still a good game to introduce some of the game mechanics to kids.

This is a pretty good game!  I am always hesitant about games I actually heard about growing up (usually I find them to be terrible), but this one proved to be a genuinely good, fun game.  I am reminded a little bit of Chess when playing this, but I like this better (there's certainly more of a theme).  There's little luck involved, really.  The game is really rather simple, but there's enough nuances with the pieces to make it interesting.  Thankfully, the variable setup also means added replayability.

UPDATE (05/10/2014): I take that back--there is certainly luck involved in terms of whether  you happen to start advancing in the direction of your opponent's flag or not.  That is, the hidden nature of their pieces means that you could spend significant time simply getting your opponent to reveal his/her pieces; meanwhile, he or she may get lucky and go straight toward your flag.

This is raw strategy and psychology to make for a great clash of wills. I love the way it can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be depending on the way you think.

Pretty interesting game.  Defense is a little difficult though so taking the initiative is important for the second player.  Also, always keep an eye out for potential positional blunders in your position--especially in regards to piece mobility.  It's not a pleasant position when your Marshall (Rank 10) piece is pinned to a corner by an enemy spy and several of your own pieces.  This game is more complex than it looks.

This was my favorite game when I was about 10 years old -- before I discovered designer board games. I still enjoy the game; it's about as light as I can go and still be thoroughly engaged. It's a timeless system and though the hobby has advanced far beyond these old classics, that says nothing about the inherent quality of a game like Stratego.

A classic. For so many young people, Stratego was the early standard in innovative gaming. One of the "original" gateway games, Stratego played a role in opening up gamers minds to the idea that there was more to gaming than just thimble-shaped pawns and dice. And as long as you're not playing it every day and you play against a relatively equal competitor, the game never seems to get old.

This game holds a special place in my heart/game-collection as the first game outside of the Milton Bradley Pantheon of games. It was my first experience with some strategy in a board game. I think I was around seven or eight when I first played this. I particularly like the wooden box edition that I have.

RATING: 6
A lot of nostalgia value here.  My father's copy has a notation on the inside of the lid that I was victorious against him at age 6.  Probably the first game that I ever played that I had to think strategically, and is a foundation for my love of games.  The circle is continuing, as I have taught this game to my own sons, as well as to my 4th grade class.  Have multiple copies in the classroom that I've picked up at garage sales and thrift stores.  My class all enjoyed and participated in the Stratego tournament we had this year.  [Thrift $1.09]

[i]Stratego[/i] feels like a mix between [i][gameid=6798][/i] and [i][gameid=2083][/i].  It's fun enough to play.  The two pools of water (and the boxes that they block) turn out to create a very predictable board.  I've been using minor variations of the same layout for thirty years or so now, to great success.  I might rate this game higher if there were more variations in how it plays out, but why change my layout when it works so well?

A better version of this game was [i][gameid=2728][/i], which had a completely open board, and a "resolution computer" that would decide the outcome of a fight between two pieces, without revealing their identities.

[i]Updated: 12/2/07, Rated: 4[/i]

If I'm going to play [i]Stratego,[/i] then I'd prefer to use a re-themed variant that offers some additional challenge.  [i][gameid=30000][/i] is the better game.  Plus, I miss the older sets that had the unit outlines painted in silver on heftier castle pieces, instead of the new, "labor intensive to assemble, but cheaper to produce" version that is available today.

Same comments as the old MB game with amendments:

Got it for the better graphics and theme for my son.  They added a few new rules too, like the spotter.  And, they flipped the numbers around, although apparently this is actually a return to the original numbering.

Pretty sturdy pieces.  It's a nice set.  My 7 yo son really likes it.

A play in Oct 2014 helped me realize this is still a fine game so I pushed it up to a 7.  Setup is important as is the actual play of the game.  Tried the defender doesn't have to show if they lose.  We abandoned it part way through.  What we did do, and I will continue to do, is in case of a tie, attacker wins.  That added a ton to the game and you had to be proactive.

I have 2.5 copies of this.  A 60's version (only the pieces), the 86 and the 96.  I hate that in the 96 version that they reversed the numbers.  I only play with the original numbers (1 being the best, 9 is a scout).

20 plays: a surprisingly light playing experienc for a game that so closely resembles chess. You can bring heavy and sophisticated strategy here, but you don't have to, because:

1) pieces really only move one square at a time, so there are not many unexpected attacks; and 
2) you can't see what pieces are, so you have little reason to try to consider every angle the way you might in chess. 

The hiding of bombs and the flag mean there's a huge amount of unpredictable sneakiness, and it's no use pretending you can prepare for it absolutely, so there's room to play with a light attitude. 

That said, since it's a nonrandom, secret information game, each player is clearly incentivized to keep records, which slows the game down and turns it into a fairly boring job of record-keeping.

There is just enough variation among piece types, though I feel the game would be stronger if it were 25% shorter, so I wish there were 25% fewer pieces.

Slow game for skulkers.  Moving one space at a time drives me nuts.  I hate people who move one piece up, attack with it, move it back, and mix it up in the army.  Ultimate Stratego is an improvement, but your time is better spent playing something else.  Thank God, Knizia rescued this genre with a game that really works...Lord of the Rings, The Confrontation.  Leave it to you Reiner...I am constantly amazed at what you can do!  (Oh, yeah, Hera and Zeus works too.)

RATING: 6
I grew up playing this and it was one of the first complicated strategy games I was introduced to when I was a kid. I loved the mind games that come into play with all the bluffing, none more so than during your initial setup. It was much more interesting than say Chess (which I learned about the same time) because it was much more straight forward to see how you were out-thinking your opponent.

A chess inspired classic with a Napoleonic pasted-on-but-effective flavor. The army deployment phase gives it an extra tactical dimension. Great game!

If you had the time, I'd bend your ear about how I grew up with the 70's edition that had different rules on how the scouts moved and how I just learned recently that all the OTHER editions were different and I feel like I've been lied to my whole life and everything sucks because of this. Obviously, I played A WHOLE LOT of Stratego in my days. A lot. Other than Chess, was my favorite game for 40 years and now I can't even look at it- unless you're going to play the 70's rules with me. Then you're doomed.

The Spin master 50th anniversary edition is actually a little different.  Unlike normal Stratego, the scout can move and attack on the same turn.  Also a new piece is introduced, the Spotter.  He is weaker than the Scout, but can be used to defeat a Marshall or bomb if he can guess what piece he is facing.  Effective use of this piece can really change the game.

As a kid I might have rated this as one of my favourites. But then, I really didn't know too many games back then. Just the standard Scotland Yard, Monopoly, Risk, Cluedo and such. But even then I rated it well below Chess.

Now, knowing so many more interesting games (I would already have loved then) Stratego simply seems to be so very average.

The score seems harsh to me except I've been in situations where one person doesn't want to get eaten and the other one wants to eat, so they just go round and round in circles until someone gives in. Add this to an already long game and... the score still seems harsh.

Unless you've played Lord of the Rings the Confrontation and you realize how the basics of this game can be transformed into a great game, and that under no circumstances would you agree to play this game ever again.

Currently I own "Mini Stratego" because it's the exact same game but takes up much less space. A nice game for 2 which has aged well. I played it quite a lot as a kid and today I look back on it with fond memories - it's definitely a game I look forward to play with my own children!

A game I would play anywhere, anytime. I remember a day in which I teached it to a friend (you do it in ten minutes) and we played it 17 times in a row.

(obviously he was an absolute beginner at the time).

RATING: 5
This is a decent, almost classic game, but not a stellar one. Can it compete with euro-games? Maybe as a "5", and in that tricky category of 2-player games, just barely. It has cafe appeal, too. I like how the set-up requires thought into strategy and tactics. Once it has one great advantage in my life: I could find people wiling to play it. But now one way or another we play euro-games. The Michael Grave's edition is quite nice. I particularly like the heavy pieces (although they use the numbering system less familiar to me, with the Marshall as the 10). I agree that there's more skill than luck to it. Some dinosaurs survive.

Light, but decent, fondly played in my youth, wouldn't opt for this now though, why play vanilla when you can take the game to the next level with LotR: The Confrontation?

Still, as mass market games go this one is pretty good and deserves some respect. The game is almost pure bluff, but it is very fast, and never outstays its welcome on the table. One of the few games that you can buy at chain stores that I wouldn't mind gifting to a child.

The best part of Stratego is the initial army set up.  If you're not spending at least half the game arranging, contemplating, and then rearranging your army, then you're probably missing out on a lot of the fun Stratego has to offer.  This is because, by and large, once the armies are placed most of the "strategy" in Stratego is over, and it plays out as a simple memory game with players running through a basic algorithm of obvious moves to determine who more effectively "outguessed" their opponent in that initial setup phase.

I played this a lot as a kid. I think I realized then that there wasn't much to it. The main thing is to keep your options open. The defender has a slight advantage last I remembered. Like chess if you get ahead then just trade pieces.

I got Stratego as a child because I whined and begged and nagged, only to discover that my parents didn't like the game and refused to play. At school we would spend our time inventing 'perfect' setups without actually playtesting them. It is in fact rather like a CCG in that regard, but without the costs. I haven't played in 20 years or so, but I expect I'd enjoy the little I think that you think that I think games; but not the endgame, which is just tedious.

I don't know that I actually agree with my own ranking.  I actually find this game relatively simple.  I never lose, and I don't think that this is because I spend a lot of time thinking out strategies.  Rather there is so little in this game that once you understand it, you can come up with a way to prevent your opponent from winning by capturing your flag.

On the other hand, my sister and I played several variants... strange I never thought I played variants on games... but anyway ours were walking bombs, walking flags, flying bombs, groups of players.

That last one was a killer, and usually ended in a tie.  So nostalgia is pretty much the reason for my ranking.

Love this game from my childhood.  My Dad and I would play this quite often.  He would usually beat me, but I learned a lot about strategy from those sessions.

My kids still play this one sometimes and really played it a lot before I found BGG.

This is the very first game that made me fall in love with board games. I played this game when I was 7 years
old at a friends house and have become obsessed ever since with this hobby. Since I have 3 younger brothers
that are equally intrigued there has never been a dull
moment in my gaming life. They also help me playtest and
design board games. Fortunatly one of my brothers is excellent at drawing and he helps me with all my art
related needs. My user name "Damlog" comes from a comic
hero I helped name and my brother made a comic out of.
Check out his art work. His female characters have the biggest boobs ever rendered on paper.

One player is Red, the other one is Blue. Both have an army of 40 pieces, including a flag and some bombs and the first one to capture the enemy flag is the winner. The pieces have different rank, so in order to win, you must attack the enemy with a higher ranking officer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I strongly dislike the massive role hidden trackable information seems to play in Stratego officially (see the 6th general preference about games in my profile for my thoughts on HTI). I'd therefore like the game much better if all revealed pieces stayed revealed (including Scouts that have revealed themselves by moving more than one space). That would have the drawback that the player who owns them has to turn them to see them. But one could also lay them down openly (or maybe turn them sideways so that both players can see them).

Stratego is pure nostalgia for me! I can remember I could not sleep because I knew the next day I would get this game for my birthday; always fun, although the fixed method to play this game is a bit unfortunate; if your opponent does not follow this method, you will always win; in my youth we played self-organized tournaments, which we sometimes played with 4 colors: blue and red against white and black; then we put 2 boards to each other (1 homemade because of the edge) and then you had to conquer 2 banners of your opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Classic strategy, pure and simple.  Variable unit strength, fog of war, bombs, and we can't forget the spy!  Kind of lackluster when compared to some of the more "realistic" historically-accurate strategy games, but plenty of fun and depth in a deceptively simple facade.

This vintage was supposed to hit the top of my preferences in my late teens but was seldom played.
Basically, you are just shooting in the dark for more than one hour or two and, towards the final phase, it's just a "cat and mouse" chase, where memory and pure calculation take the best.
But it's just too little for so much effort and "mise en scene"...

Classic, pure strategy.  The version I have is a newer "sci-fi" themed version that added a "spotter" which is the only other piece aside from the spy that can be a threat to a Marshall (10).  If you have a friend that enjoys strategy, this will be a hit.  Soldier placement/formation, movement, and bluffing, I love this game.

This was a childhood favorite of mine that has withstood the test of time (unlike &quot;The Game of Life&quot;).  I wouldn&#039;t want to play it every week but I do so enjoy the tension of attacking a piece, having no idea what will happen.  There is a new Lord of the Rings two player game which is essentially Stratego reborn, I enjoyed that one too and will comment separately on it.

I still enjoy Stratego. I like the aspect of choosing your starting position/setup. Combining bluffs with mobility of strong units/your spy, and using your weak units for scouting and bomb diffusion.

I probably haven't played this game in about five years, but it is potentially my most played boardgame (unless you count online Puerto Rico). I enjoy the setup phase of this game although I can see how that wouldn't appeal to some people. I like how the spy, mines, and miners add to the strategy. My only knock on this game is that you can occasionally end up tediously chasing pieces around the board (if your opponent is unwilling to admit defeat). I play where the spy wins when attacking any piece instead of just against the Marshall.

I played this game alot as a kid and I still enjoy it today. The bluffing element of this game is great. And when you start pounding away at your enemy's ranks, the suspense is sometimes unbearable...will you run into a bomb, the flag? Not as complex as some 2-player games out there, but still alot of fun.

Loved this as a kid.  Played a variant where the spy could only be defeated by a bomb, another spy (both died), or the 1 (Marshall?) and only if the 1 attacked first.  Boy the Spy could really do some damage.  The game is ot so good when compared with games of today, however not a bad game for introducing kids to strategy gaming.

The bluffing side of this is the best.  I actually made a youth group version of this taking playing cards and giving red to one team and black to another.  Each person draws a card and the goal is to "kill" the other teams king (flag) by having someone touch them.  10s are bombs, and you use the same numbers from Ace to 9, and Jack is a spy.

Prefer Lotr: the Confrontation. Look at my comment on the game.

I played a lot when I was a kid growing up. I enjoyed the game as a kid, but I won't be playing again as an adult unless to spend time with niece's and nephew's etc. Or possibly some non-gamers. If so, they should have a copy of the game in question. I don't have my own copy since I switch from American board games to euro board games.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

2015-08-10 : I had discovered chess some time before and was still having lots of fun with it so asking for a boardgame for X-Mas or my birthday suddenly became a viable option.

So I asked for and got Stratego - and it was a nice version with round plastic tower-like pieces.

Tip : trying to bluff your little sister into thinking your flag is in a corner surrounded by bombs while it's actually in the front row does not work.

I liked it less than chess because once your marshal got killed by the opposing spy or you managed to kill the opposing spy it was game-over - thinking about it so many years later this might have been our first case of group-think.

Anyway, it only got played a couple of times - also because it was a 2-player only game and we usually had some friends around willing to play a game, so games like Clue got played a whole lot more. Trying to catch colonel Mustard with the chandelier in the library was a whole lot interesting than Stratego.

My favorite 2 player game, played a lot growing up. Its a more fun version of chess except you dont know which pieces are which for your opponent. I like that the game is different every time with how each side sets up their pieces.  This isn't all luck/guessing either, how you set things up and plan your moves and calculate risks has a lot less luck than the game would sometimes appear to have. I would play this any time.

Classic bluffing/deduction battle game that I thoroughly enjoyed and played often in my childhood.  LOTR the Confrontation has similar mechanics, but is a shorter and superior game.  I'd much rather play LOTR or Hera and Zeus.  My 9 year old did come up with a quicker and more chaotic variant that can be fun: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/440672]Reverse Stratego[/url] - in which you play blind and backwards!

I find it a brilliant game and don't understand why people would describe it as shallow and simplistic.
Stratego doesn't give you many "prepackaged" rules, it's up to you to develop sneaky and effective strategies and bring them into play.
It isn't simply about advancing, attacking and memorizing the other player's soldiers and tracking their movement on the board.
You can bluff, create diversions, lead the enemy's strongest "pawns" into ambushes, and muddy the waters in many different ways - The options may not be infinite but you can still have a lot of fun playing - it's all up to you!

Comparable to chess or checkers, except that you can move backwards with any piece. This leads to an imbalance between good, offensive players and stalemate-stagnation players. The good player might not want to play a game that lasts 5 times as long, giving an edge to the nitty player.

Also, conservative players may not enjoy the large randomness of a player willing to charge his captain (3) through his opponent's ranks, ignoring the risk of bombs or higher ranking pieces.

CONTRAS:
-Número limitado de jugadores, aunque con el Stratego 4 aumenta hasta 4

Edition from mid-90's, scooped up at Wal-Mart on clearance.

Stratego is a great, light, fun game of bluffing and tactics.  The "fog of war" can be introduced to other gamers using just this game.  Often a poor setup will doom you, but sometimes a risky but unconventional setup will throw your opponent off and buy you time to find his flag.

A keeper, lots of fun.  I played it so much that it did lose some of that initial luster, and I've grown into more complicated games than Stratego, but I would never turn down a quick game of this.

I like Stratego!  It has some obvious strategies to pursue, a little memory work, and some good-ol' fashioned bluffing.  This is never a game you want to play too much of as it's fairly routine, but for its age it still has a lot of classic fun behind it. Plus, it was the game Mulder was playing with his sister was kidnapped by extra-terrestrials! Regardless of how light it is, there is still a little tension to be had scoping out your opponent's flag. Same sort of tingle you get from Battleship, but Stratego is a little more interesting than that chestnut. I don't have a lot of room for games I have purely for nostalgia, but there's just enough in this one to keep it around and pull it out every couple of years.

I used to play this game pretty hardcore in elementary school. Now, as an adult, it still holds up well enough that I don't mind playing it from time to time, if the mood is right. The copy I now have as an adult has the Marshall at rank 10 instead of zero the way I remember it as a kid. That still messes me up at times, just like with miners being 3s now instead of 8s and scouts being 2s instead of 9s.

RATING: 7
Deceptively simple game of pure strategy. Always a pleasure to challenge new players - do they tuck their flag away behind a screen of bombs, or play a more subtle bluff game? Stratego is a great introduction to gaming for the younger player and can still hold the interest of the hardened veteran.  Loads of rule variations to experiment with, ensures longterm replayability.

A fantastic game! Sure the art work may leave something to be desired, but I'm more interested in the playing of the game. Classical strategies can be deployed like in no other game. Simple enough to teach to a 7 year old, but takes years to truely master. Well worth the buy. I think most of the negative comments come from the fact that the game isn't new. Niether is wine, but I like that.

Classic. But in comparison to the modern games it's rather monotonous and simple. Once you figure out some of your opponents' soldiers it loses it's charme and becomes a dull exchange of strikes.

Maybe I didn't play with the right people but another game based on the same idea (Knizia's Lord of the Rings: Confrontation) makes everything a lot better, more tactical and quicker.

Note to future opponents: I definitely won't put the flag in the front row, behind one of the ponds; no way.

I loved this game as a kid, and haven't played it in a while, but imagine it's still pretty fun.  It never lost it's luster to me.

Of course, I think the problem is that your strategic options are somewhat limited (unless you want to go completely random and illogical -- which is also fun sometimes, to throw people for a loop), but there are still several of them, and it's fun to try to see if you can figure out what your opponent is trying (and to waylay them with strategies that SEEM like the standards but are actually red herrings...)

Unfortunately, there are limited tactics to be used in this, but that still accounts for a good enough variety to keep it interesting and maintain replayability (especially if you play against different opponents)

I played this one a lot when I was a kid. Won some, lost some, won some more and loved it every time. 

I usually brought it along when visiting my cousin, who is brilliant at abstract games and it was one of the few games I could beat her on semi regular basis.

After playing Stratego last night for the first time in a long time, I realized I should bump it up from a 5 to a 6.  It was a lot of fun pushing around pieces, keeping track of which pieces were where, etc.

I typically am not a fan of 1v1 games, and I don't normally have just one other person around who would play this, so I doubt I'll be playing it any more frequently.  But it does deserve a little more credit than I previously gave it.

RATING: 9
(02/07/2011) Rating for nostalgia. This was a great strategy game when I was a kid in the 1970's. Almost like chess, but with the "fog of war" aspect where one does not know where the enemy flag is, as well as the location and disposition of enemy pieces. I suppose this was the first "block" style wargame.

It is a game of attrition, much like chess, where one must keep track of enemy units destroyed, as well as number of specific ranked pieces left on the battlefield. I believe there is usually too much emphasis on solely using the marshal or general; they must be used in conjunction with other units. The cat-and-mouse element of the Spy vs the Marshal, which keeps the marshal's power in check, is brilliant. However, lose the spy, and you will surely lose the battle. There are many tactical considerations beyond this, such as tempo, and material superiority, concepts that are shared in chess, go, and shogi.

The initial layout and concentration of own forces with respect to the enemy forces (and flag) is unknown and unpredictable, as both sides secretly setup their side of the board. This unpredictability can be mitigated with proper play by opening up maneuver rows, and destruction of enemy units in enemy territory. The layout is the strategic portion of the game.

I would think this is still a great strategic and tactical game by today's standards, and it holds up well alongside chess, go, and shogi. The hidden element makes this game a classic. An interesting variant I played once is the three-board variant. A friend had 3x copies of this game, where the boards are placed side-by-side (with pieces allowed to move across boards) for 3x the fun and mayhem.

Nostalgia rating: "9" -- played this all the time back then.
Present rating: "6" -- haven't played since college (1984-85), but would be willing to pull it out if there is a worthy opponent. :-)

A great, basic strategy game for 2.  Perfect for teaching young kids tactics, and basic strategies for gaming.  There are no dice, no spinners, no cards, no random game board setup...its just two equal armies fighting on a symmetrical battlefield.  More simple than chess, more complex than checkers.  Evolution of tactics plays like this 1) put bombs out randomly and flag in the back row. 2)  hide flags behind wall of bombs in corner. 3) hide flag and mid lvl unit behind bombs to protect flag from miners.  4) hide high lvl unit behind wall of bombs with flag to protect flag. 5) put bombs randomly around map and flag somewhere in the back row.  I enjoy playing with my young daughter and watching her go through this learning curve.

I played this a lot as a kid, but in retrospect I don't think much of it.  My favorite trick was to move a bomb, and then immediately say, "No, I changed my mind. Can I take that back?"  Then my opponent would go after that piece with his biggest guy and get blown up.  My second favorite trick was to put my Flag alone somewhere near the front with no protection, while back in a corner I had two bombs and the piece hidden behind them was either a Sergeant or a third bomb.  Either trick was risky, but fun when it worked.

This game is one of my childhood favorites.  It doesn't take much time to learn (10 minutes) however it does take a long time to figure out all the strategies (which may turn off some people).  The game takes about 10 minutes to setup too as you place all of your pieces.  The game itself takes between 20-30 minutes.  There isn't much luck (guess which pieces are which) in this game as it is mostly strategy and memory.  Actually there is a lot of memory to this in remember which pieces you discovered.  I'd recommend this as a game play whenever you can find someone on your same level of strategy as you are.  You will frustrait less experience players and be frustraited with more experienced players.

This game is one of the first boardgames that actually appealed to me when I was younger.  It would be quite a while until I found out all I was missing in boardgaming years later.  The game only gets better with house rules and variants which were employed mightly on boring days after school.

This is the only game from my original collection (Risk, Clue, etc.) to last after I became a true geek and still earn its spot on the shelf.  I'm a bit curious why it rates so low here on the geek as it has a lot of mechanics that are revered in other games.  After seeing how highly LotR: Confrontation rates, I am a bit inclined to call it snobbery.

Update: I got a spiffy, new Michael Graves edition board with all the bells and whistles to show off my love for this game.  I should also mention I play with a few variants and rules tweaks that wasn't clear in my initial review (didn't really dawn on me until I actually reread the rules it came with!).

Definitely my favorite game. 

It's 2 players, so you don't need to organize some big event to get everyone over.

Good memorization of the other player's soldiers is key to helping you decide how to move your own pieces around to break through their defenses, and even then...they may have been tricking you all along, and their flag is in a very inconspicuous place.

Never fails to make time and space slip away around me except for the board and the player opposite me, as we are locked in this intense, sweaty-palmed conflict of strategy and mind games.

If you&#039;re a kid, this will capture your imagination. The pieces are cool to look at, set up and pretend that you&#039;re leading them. Winning requires a strategic mind and boldness. This doesn&#039;t translate well for adults, though. After one game, staleness sets in. The pieces are too crowded and the game board doesn&#039;t allow too many options. Like chess without the elegance. Still, it can be fun once in awhile, and kids do love it.

Stratego is a classic game. It was designed on 1947 but even today it still sells very well.

I played it twice when I was a kid and I really liked it, but, nowadays, there are much better games so my desire to play it again is very low. I could play it if requested, but I would prefer to play a similar, but superior implementation ( Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation).

Current Rating: 5.0

I have at least 2 plays before 2010 thus I have not logged them.

RATING: 5
 	I think this game was brilliant in the mechanic it introduced and I think it's still a decent game actually.

My major complaint with this one was rediscovered in a recent game (I was longing for a Stratego match recently)--there's a tipping point in power which can not be overcome unless the opponent blows something major.

With out going on a long writing of my thoughts, I'll try to keep it short:

In chess, any piece can take any piece, in LOTR: the confrontation, cards make up power differences and introduces hand management...in Stratego higher power beats lower powers (all the time). If you play an opponent with skill and they capture your higher pieces (by good play), you have no shot. Say your mid range units are leveled by his power house and he gets your second highest unit as well...the best you can hope for is to cause the double loss of both highest ranked units (ties cause both units to be destroyed). If that happens, you're done...there is no way to capture his remaining higher ranked units unless they hit a bomb (a good player will throw fodder units at blocks that haven't moved before sending ringers at them).

Therefore the balance of power has been swung and you can not make up the difference at any time and you'll loose units left and right.

It's a good game, good design, good skills needed, and actually has strategy, but there is no way to catch the leader once the powerbalance has swung (unless they blow the 'find a bomb' manuevers). Still, I'd gladly give it to kids (as I think it's a great kids game to learn and strategize with) and I'd still play it with them gladly.

I wanted to like this game, but didn't. Still don't.  Maybe because it's too long a game, maybe because an unfortunate bomb to a general (that's the highest numbered one, right?) would put you at a huge disadvantage. Just never got into it.

LOVED this game as a kid.  Obviously have outgrown it as more challenging games have been released and better mechanics have been developed.  Fun to play with my kids.

PLEASE, if you get a copy of Stratego, please get an '86 or earlier.  And, for God's sake, don't get a themed one.  Nothing says poseur like Lord of the Rings Stratego.  I'm sure I'm biased because I had the '86 version and my uncles--who were very instrumental in forming my love of gaming--had the late '60s version.

All components included (pieces, trays, insert, board).  This is copyright 1961 on the inside of the box.  Illustration of father and son (circa 50's?) on front.  Box has split corners and part of a side fold missing.  It isn't falling apart but is in poor condition.  Pieces themselves are in very good condition as well as the board (not fraying, delaminating, good strong binding, etc.)  Gold and silver embossing is not faded or rubbed off.

Stratego is a simple, enjoyable game. It contains more depth and strategy than may be readily apparent at first. This is a great game for kids as a precursor to deeper strategy games, but it offers enough meat for a compelling clash between adults.

Semi-strategic game in which you move pieces around the board, hoping your more powerful soldiers take out the enemy. Those with better memory can keep the game interesting, otherwise it becomes a race around the board to knock out the generals. Best part: Robot Chicken made a fantastic parody.

PLUS: two-player interaction
MINUS: once, twice, and then you're bored with it

A classic, and the first strategy game that I remember learning as a kid. This game has a big nostalgia factor for me. It’s not a favorite these days but I still enjoy dusting it off now and then and I look forward to teaching the game to my children one day. 

It’s got very simple and intuitive rules but is not a light game by any means. It is a game of strategy and tactics but to play well it also requires good memory and concentration in order to keep track of the opponent’s previously revealed pieces.

I recommend Target’s wooden box ’Library’ edition by the way. It‘s the original game, with classic pieces and board, but the bookshelf style box and presentation is really nice.

In my opinion, this is one of the best classic games. Maybe it's not highly rated because it's so simple and old school.  That's unfortunate because it's an excellent game.  It's elegant and dynamic despite how basic it is.  There are few new games that work this well and are this balanced.  Definitely a must for the collection if you like strategic, secret information games and if you enjoy playing mind games with your opponent.

RATING: 5
The board is much too crowded (at least in the beginning) to allow for meaningful moves. This feeling of sliding puzzles always bothered me most with this game. With the values of the pieces hidden, it also resembles memory a bit, which imho is also not a positive thing. I own a small, cheap travel edition of this title and think that's more than sufficient.

I've only played Stratego a few times, but so far it has greatly surpassed my expectations. I think people rate it harshly, either because it's an old Milton Bradley game, or because they don't like the memory aspect of it (which is essential for this kind of hidden information bluffing game), or because they think the rules are too simple or childish (which makes little sense, given the many acclaimed and subtle games that have rules just as simple).

There's plenty of room for varying strategies, great meta-game, and it's quite fast to play. I also own LotR: The Confrontation, and that game is excellent, but these two games are still different enough that the latter does not replace the former. This is an underrated classic, and a rare example of a majorly mass-produced game that doesn't suck heaps of rotten ass through a bendy straw!

Never interested me...bland strategy game is never my cup of tea.  They are dry, dull and vanilla.  Not even a sense to what is the military really doing, nor is there a tactic of any sort.  How people would play this kind of game for fun, without any backdrop and highly abstracted?  Why not just play Go and Chess?  This game is killed by Axis and Allies, which at least has plastic army men for you to throw with.

Stratego is a classic and one of the first boardgames I owned, and I still have that one. Unlike it's name suggests it's more of a tactical game. As of now there are more interesting games out there, although this one still scores a 6 for being wellknown, so I can play this with almost anyone.

I don't know that this is a bad game at all--in fact it's probably a very good game.  I just don't enjoy it for some reason.  Maybe because I'm not very good at it.  But it always felt annoying to me to try and move things into place and to try to trick my opponent into moving his marshall passed my spy, etc, instead of fun.  I don't really know why.

Sure it is strategic for a classic game, but it is basically an abstract with its very bland "combat" (if you can even call it that), and while I''m sure a great player will always beat a poor player, when players are on near equal footing the effects of accidentally getting a strong unit defeated by a bomb is way too swingy.

This game has a fog of war where your pieces look that same from the back and only face you.  You move pieces one space at a time and attack.  There are special abilities of some pieces like the scout can move any number of species, the miner can destroy a bomb, the spy can kill the marshal.  It is one of the better old games, but not really that fun.  

Modern equivalents to this game are games like Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar.  Both are much better games.

Have the 1961 wooden version, found at an antique barn.  In excellent shape, like new.  Played this quite a bit in my youth with my best friend growing up.  Used his copy, because back then I didn't own it.  Years later I "rediscovered" the game.  Sure, there are perhaps better games, but there is enough strategy, and the hidden units aspect, the bluffing, etc. to make it quite fun.

RATING: 5
The ratio of fun to time is on the low side for me, but one of my kids enjoys the tension and surprise.

[url=http://www.ultrastratego.com/alternativerules.php]Ultrastratego.com[/url] suggests a bunch of variants, including rules to mix and match. I enjoyed these:
+ The spy moves as a scout.
+ Carry the flag to your side to win.

Perhaps a reduced piece variation will address my fun-to-time objection, like [i]Barrage[/i] (12899SBF) or [i]Quick Arena[/i] (128899SBBF on 8x8). (Noted using the old convention where 1 is strongest.)

Stratego deserves its place on the mantle of classics. It's been around for over 50 years, yet has stood the test of time. I've enjoyed many games of it with my boys (ages 9 and 10.5 at the time of this commentary). The edition I bought is great for them. It has 30 pieces instead of 40 and is sci-fi themed, rather than Napoleonic. Both of these contribute to the game being more accessible to them, in terms of having ample strategic depth, without being too cumbersome.

I originally had the wooden block Admirals version, and I have recently picked up a plastic Stratego.  Only down side, the pieces are not numbered, so you have to look at the ranks on the board to compare strength. Won`t be a problem after a few games, but having numbers on the pieces is easier.

Probably the game that is responsible for my game passion. When I was very young, I'm guessing, 8 years old, I was impressed by this game, that my friends at school brought to the classroom to play during the last week of school before holidays. 

Stratego still is a great game. It tests your memory and your guts. The strategy is in the setup. After that, it's just trying, daring and doing.

Played several times as a teenager (between 1975 and 1980)

Probably the first wargame I ever played.  I remember the Christmas my younger brother and I received this, and the countless number of games we played sitting at my Grandmother's kitchen table.  I can't remember who won the most games, but that original game probably had a few hundred plays on it when it finally sold at a garage sale years later.  Honestly, there's not all that much to the game, but it's easy, my son enjoys playing it, and there's some wondeful nostalgia whenever I open the box.  An old favorite.

I have only played Stratego a few times, but it offers a decent amount of 'strategy'. Setting up the game seems to be the where most of the game is. After that, you simply play through your set up and try to memorize your opponents pieces. I taught my 10 year old nephew how to play in 5 minutes.

I own one of the newer versions where the Marshall is a 10.  Boy, I HATE THAT!!  

But, other than that, it does come with a nicely detailed cardboard piece that you can put between the two people playing to block your opponents eyes from your own setup.  And, a nice tray to hold all the pieces comes included as well...

Stratego is more of a game than just blind luck.  There is some definite strategy in HOW you set up your pieces... as well as how you use them during the game... more strategy than most people think!!

16/7/11: from Oxfam for £5.00 for the 1978 Jumbo mini edition.  Claims to be missing two pieces, but I don't think that's the case - there are two extra stands but no missing cards.  Previous owner left a couple of odd pieces of cardboard in the box as if they we were developing their own variant!

I recieved Stratego as a birthday gift and loved every minute of it. Its small enough where you can pack it into a suitcase for  a trip and fast enough that you could use it as a "filler".

The reason I have this game at a pretty higher rating than most everyone else is because I'm really good at it :P Kind of lame, I know, but I literally cannot lose at this game. I've even told other players my strategy, and the basic idea of how I set up my pieces, and I still mop the floor with them. I'm really not that good of a boardgamer, but something about this game just "clicks" with me. So I have to pay my homage to it in my BGG rating, because truthfully, I really won't ever turn down a game of this.

Some oldies are goodies... and I vote Stratego belongs in that class. Think of chess, where all the pieces look alike and you never know if you're about to step all over a pawn, or get annihilated by a lurking queen.

I don't bother to rate or review most old classic board games (Monopoly, Life, Sorry, etc.) because they are dull and random compared to modern games, and everyone knows everything there is to know about them.

Stratego is a notable exception. It is neither dull or random, and has both tactical and strategic intricacies worthy of modern games.

I recommend using a variant which makes the game much better - require each player to set up all their pieces at random. While this makes each game 'unfair', it adds a huge amount of variety and replayability. Is your flag in the front row? Go for a blitzkrieg attack. Nothing is more satisfying than winning with a strange setup.

If you're taking it seriously, I also recommend using a chess clock.

Although it's suited for competitive play, it's a simple game compared to chess, so optimal strategy's can be found/cracked easily and stalemates can sometimes happen between evenly skilled players.

I was taught the game by an older cousin with a circa 1957 version with wooden pieces (that fell over quite easily!). I own a late 1962 Milton Bradley version with plastic pieces. A Marshall is a 1, as it should be. I found it ludicrous they later reversed the numbers and made a Marshall a 10. 
A lot of people think this is just a kids game. I don't.  For it contains a good deal of strategy.

My first real board game I've played when I was a child thirty-something years ago. On a vacation I saw a kid with a shabby homemade paper copy, asked about it, and we spent the next ten days playing it day and night. I was amazed, I said myself: [i]This dude is a fucking genius to invent such a game![/i] and after the vacation I forgot about it completely.

Many years later when I realized that the snotty five years old bastard -also known as my older son- is actually good for something other than [i]'now you see me, now you don't'[/i], we've submerged into board gaming through the usual gateways like Carcassonne, Stratego came back to me, and came back with a revenge. I didn't even know it's name, but remembering some of the rules it was easy to hunt a copy down. 

Since then it's my second most sacred game in my collection, almost nothing could came close to it in excitement, replayability and variety thanks to the uncountable alternate rules.

My son has really taken a liking to this game- he's seven, so right about on track.  He's learned all the names, and it's fun to see the evolution of his strategy: now he's into 'surround the flag with bombs' phase.  He also is quite fearful to attack, for fear of losing his pieces to bombs.  He'll beat me someday soon, though.  He already puts the screws on his mama.

Good game for kids, or to play with a kid, okay for adults (but there are better options, especially LOTR: The Confrontation, which is similar, but much more fun).

RATING: 7
This is the classic game of Capture the Flag. Each side has 40 units at their disposal and they can be placed in any combination at the beginning of play (in rows of 4). 

The aim is to capture the flag of the enemy before they get yours and a series of ranks determines who wins out when one piece attacks the other.

The trick though is that each sides forces are hidden (the identity of each piece) so the players must engage in reconnaissance to work out who is where and then maneuver superior forces in order to capture them.

Throw in bombs, scouts, miners to disable bombs and Stratego earns the classic title well. Every kid (boy at least) aged 8-12) should play this game on their gaming journey.

Surprisingly, this is one of those few games I didn't even quite enjoy as a kid. I remember liking the idea of controlling an army and battling your opponent, but it was kinda meh. That, or I just was really bad at it. Bluffing with bombs does sound really interesting to me though. But it feels a bit too much like guessing than reading the opponent.

How would chess work if every piece had a secret strength that is only revealed in fights? Stratego gives a positive answer to that question. In a way, Stratego is a more realistic gamification of a battle than chess is. Just like a real general, you organize your forces (pieces) and defense lines (bombs) yourself and act on information in the heat of the war (the strength of opponent pieces as skirmishes take place). The only reason I don't play this more often is that I don't get to play two player games that often nowadays.

This game had a huge influence on me as a child. This was my favorite abstract strategy game, and was one of my favorite games overall.

I should note that when I played this as a kid we played with what I did not realize until recently was a house rule, namely that the attacker can see the value of both pieces, but the defender does not. I prefer that variant both for mechanical reasons and for the increased drama it brings to the game. But even with the rules as written Stratego I still find Stratego fun occasionally. It's difficult for me to separate the nostalgia from my appreciation for the game overall. I know Stratego is not the best abstract ever made, and even decades ago there were games that were arguably much better (even excluding chess, checkers, go, and other classic abstracts), but it's fun, and I'm glad to have a copy on my shelf.

A classic strategy game that is fun to play, even though can be annoying when one units runs through so many units in a row. Movement is very limited so this has happened a few times before. Wish there was a little more strategy after the unit placement, and wish there was some better movement rules, but it fun nonetheless.

I got a copy of Stratego in 1961 when I was nine years old. I was literally a stalker with this game. I took it along almost everywhere I went, trying to cajole people to play it with me.

Simple abstract game with military theme. Goal is to capture the hidden flag of your opponent.

Board is divided into squares. 

Players arrange their soldiers in rows, one per square, across the field from their opponent. Each piece is ranked from private to field marshal, but the rank remains hidden till opposing soldiers meet on the same square. Higher rank defeats lower, the Assassin and Bomb being an exception. Soldiers move only one space, while spies can move several spaces, but thus reveal their true nature. Jumping not allowed.

Each player in this two player game has different numbered pawns, bombs, and one flag with the goal to reach the opponents' said flag.  The lower the number on the piece, the stronger they are (a 1 beats a 9), only the spy can kill the 1, 8's can destroy bombs, and one of the numbers can move forward more than one space.

The interesting part of this game is in the set-up where you can make a unique configuration every game to try and stump your opponent.  Do you want to be more aggressive or stay back with a defensive set-up?  Do you want to surround your flag with bombs somewhere on the map?  Do you want to surround a bomb with bombs to throw off your opponent in thinking the flag is behind those bombs?  There are quite a few options in placing your initial army, and for a board game from this generation that was widely distributed, it has quite a bit of strategy and is a very good game.  I have many fond memories of this game from my childhood.

Old but never dated - Stratego's concept of fighting the enemy without actually knowing its pieces until actual combat is both original and surprisingly accurate (when did armies go to the battlefield knowing how which rival soldier fought?). It's definitely no mere rock-paper-scissors affair: setting up the pieces to allow a good mix of attack and defense needs even more care than developing the pieces.

Requires a super-human memory or X-ray vision to play well. Too much like hard work, but fun in small bouts. Leaving revealed soldiers 'face-up' helps remove one major obstacle to the fun.

[2010/01/01] +100 plays before recording


love this game... but i don't have anyone to play against...
i played on the internet and unlike internet chess or internet catan i never got in the groove... is was almost like there was the "next level" of stratego play that all of the internet players had already acheived, and i didn't think it was worth the time to get to that level.


I would play in person again, but it would have to be against a chess player kind of person....

stratego is a cool game, but it does take a while to play, and it gets extremely monotonous towards the end... *sometimes* a losing player can pull off the miraclous victory, but for the most part it's a downward spiral... [somewhat similar to chess.. but the big difference with chess is that you can always evaluate the current situation completely, and resign/restart if the game gets out of hand... not to mention with chess you can quickly win from a losing position if the leader make a small mistake... not usually the case with stratego]


p.s. the game field command seems to combine the best part of stratego (the blind troop arrangement) and the order submisson of diplopmacy into a neat game... i'm going to hopefully get to play that some day

Fun game. Biggest problem with this one is piece overload. Losing a big piece doesn't seem to carry the weight that it does in chess or other strategy games. Most of my games end with both players only having 2 or 3 pieces left regardless of the rest of the gameplay. 

HOWEVER, it is still a pretty intense game. The streamlined 2011 re-release is much better than the original.

I can't believe that this is the first time i'm playing this game!! I know it's an old one, but it's a great one!!  :)  There's a lot of luck involved in this game but strategy is key as you choose where to place your bombs and flag. Memory (and attention!) are key, otherwise you'll end up persistently chasing your opponent's number 7 with your number 9 until he gets you to within reach of his number 10.  :)  hehehe... oh what a fun game.

A game we played a lot as kids but doesn't hold up well for nowadays. Essentially a game of bluff, trying to guess the values of the opponent's pieces and take them down with your high value pieces, whilst not losing your own high pieces to the evil mines that don't move. Guess and double-guess. Problems include there being no incentive to attack and the mid and end games are bedevilled by taking a bunch of boring turns (at one square a move) to move your next bevy of units up the board and into the mix. The setup takes too long, the turns aren't exciting and the decisions along the way aren't interesting.

I remember this being loads of fun as a kid. The hidden movement concept was very unqiue at that time from what I can remember. The only games with this type of mechanism today are the "block games" you hear so much about. It obviously heavily favors those with good memories. Half the fun of the game (or more) is in the initial setup of pieces, trying to figure out where to post your flag and bombs and miners and scouts and marshal and spy! 2/2010: have wood-box version, and deluxe wood-box with throw-back colors and reverse values, both purchased from target a few years ago.

Interesting two player abstract strategy game. A good strategy, tactical insight and some bluffing skills are all important to win this game. So it's a good game considering that. However, the pace is very slow (most pieces are only able to move one space) and in the end it gets quite a drag since most of the time the winner is apparant way before the end and it's just a matter of time ...

RATING: 6
I had fond memories of Stratego from school, but the high skill element has made it something I play less now. Like chess, I have trouble convincing another player that they want to play. It's definitely strong on tactics and not necessarily big on fun.

It's a "classic" strategy game of which I like, however as others probably noted, there are holes in it.  Having the blind ranked units and only one way to remove them becomes stale.  It generally is a game of trading off pieces.

The favorite game of my youth.  Has a nice mechanic that several games have copied over the years, such as Hera & Zeus and LotR:C.  I might play this again some day, but I doubt it, mainly because my wife likes less conflict-oriented two-player games, and I'd rather play Memoir '44, Hera & Zeus, Attika, or Duel of Ages for other 2-player fests.

RATING: 3
A good example of an obsolete game. Too many pieces and too many ranks for very little variety in powers and moves - what's the point featuring so many intermediate ranks if they all do the same? 

Maybe this could be improved with variants that feature less pieces and/or allow for customization of the armies by each player. But, as it stands, it is extremely boring.

A very straight-forward and simple game that just about anyone can get into.  However, most of the fun is in the setup, and then you have another 30-45 minutes of going through the motions.

RATING: 6
A very accessible classic that we still play occasionally.
The set-up is almost as important as the actual play of the pieces, as the characters behind each piece are hidden and can be placed at your wish with a different structure every game.
Most of the pieces are played the same way, they are just higher or lower in rank than others, but it has some nice tweaks in the form of special pieces: bombs and miners, explorers, and (my favorite) the spy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic. It has its problems, and honestly boils down into an hourlong fight of rock-paper-scissors, but it's great for giving a good wargame feel without being remotely close to an actual wargame. It pales in comparison to today's offerings, but it's still playable occasionally.

BONUS Nostalgia trip: This used to be my favorite board game when I was a kid. I loved the hidden information aspect of it. The Spy adds so much to the game. I was always the master of the spy; I would plan my entire game around it. The bombs were also a good way to keep the power level of the top piece in check. This is not a deep game, but it has just enough layers to be mildly entertaining every time we bring it out. I respect the quality of the design in an era where Battleship was a better-than-average kind of game.

Still one of my faves! The most important mechanic of this classic is something that war games have been trying to achieve the same level for a very long time, and that is the fog of war. You don't know what the other player has in front of you until you engage in combat, or if he moves a scout more than one space. My son loves this game! And I love playing it with him

For my brother and I, this was a bit like Lucy, Charlie Brown and Checkers - he lost 20  games in a row but never gave up!

Needs house rules to prevent stalling play.

Similar to Chess, although each piece is limited to one orthogonal move per turn and, most importantly, the identity of a player's pieces (which vary in rank, and therefore strength in battle) are hidden from other players until combat.

Simple game, quick, and fun.  This is the "nostalgia" edition in the wooden box.  Only differences between this and the regular stratego is the packaging, the board is a 2 fold instead of one to fit into the square box, and the marshal is 1 instead of the general (like the old game).  Otherwise the same.  One of the few "mainstream" boardgames that have no luck involved and all strategy/tactics.  Pioneering game for its time.

Bought this cheaply at a games expo trade-in.  Good, fun, light on rules, and cerebral enough to appeal to my chess grandmaster wannabe side.

RATING: 4
There can be some exciting moments, but on the whole, a little too dry and abstract for me.  And too chance-y.  Yes, there is technically "no luck," but that doesn't mean that there's no "chance."  Hidden information can make for good tension, but I think there's too much here.  I don't like the blind attacking for the first half of the time while you're trying to figure out your opponent.  The psychological element of the last half can be sorta fun, but not quite enough to redeem itself.  Ultimately, not a game I feel like playing very often.

I don't understand the hate for this game.  It's quick and fun.  There's some luck to it, but mostly it's judging where the flag is based on how your opponent moves his pieces and rembering what pieces you have seen of your opponents.

While I don't have the 1947 version, I have the regular nineties version and this is one of those games that just collects dust. I should pull it out just for nostalgic reasons.

OK Game.  More fun when you don't realize there are so many better block games out there.  Stratego quickly gets to the point where you do the same thing over and over, and you can semi-stalemate with your opponent...

This is a great game. It has a chess-like strategic feel to it, yet it isn't prone to heavy analysis before the game begins. I have fond memories of this game from my childhood. It is definitely underrated among games here on the BGG: the rules are simple and elegant, it lends itself to strategic decision-making, and it is fun. For those who are searching for two-player games, Stratego ranks highly in my book.

I own the Onyx Stratego version.

As much "luck" as there can be involved, it still makes both participants think. If you set up wrong and your strategy falls flat, sometimes it feels like you beat yourself rather than the other way around. That's the downfall of the game.

The strong points are the fun placement and initial strategy phase and the mind games you can play with moving your pieces around while attacking/defending. Definitely a classic for a good reason. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game frequently played when I was young.

Than someone stepped on a playing piece, I think it was the marschal, and we had it replaced.
Unfortunatly the new piece was of a different collor than the old and that killed the game.

I've got my own copy now, nothing wrong with that, really should play it again, it was allways fun.
But, so many games, so little time....

When I was a latchkey child and spent many hours in after school care I played an awful lot of Stratego. Other activities included building crazy structures from toothpicks and candlewax, drawing Doc Smith style spacecraft on the blackboard, and being locked in a shed by the larger children.

Anyway, I could play this a couple of times a year and have a good time, but I can't think of a compelling reason to buy it over the multitude of fine 2P games out there. Probably the best of the Milton Bradley games.

Le Stratego, c'est bien, mangez en. Quoique. Si on pouvait annoncer une telle phrase sans rougir il y a encore dix ans, de nombreux jeux plus modernes ont quand même donné un sacré coup de vieux à l'ancêtre.

Une partie de Stratego se joue au moment du placement initial. Ensuite, c'est un jeu de mémoire, et peut être un peu de bluff, un peu mou et un peu long.

Plusieurs grands jeux ont aujourd'hui repris le principe de base des pions cachés à l'adversaire : [gameid=2290], un jeu poids plume, et [gameid=3201], absolument génial et intégrant parfaitement le thème du Seigneur des Anneaux. [gameid=12995], le plus calculatoire de la petite famille (et aussi là où le doute subsiste le moins longtemps, les pions étant révélés à l'entrée dans une salle), est sans doute le plus riche à long terme.

An early infatuation of mine.  When I was very young and started exploring board games available to me, this was one of my favourites.  I loved the secrecy of placing units and the memory involved in following opponents units.  It's heavy luck but one of the better mainstream classics.  When I discovered it I just thought "this is like Battleship but even better!" (I liked Battleship plenty).

Today, I would still play a game of it, but it suffers from having a lot of competition from other 2 player games, and I find that my 2 player gaming time is pretty scarce.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Snubbed by the imperious gaming "aristocracy" for what must be its accessibility, availability, and acceptability, the game is actually a deeply strategic affair - even more so than many of its more "high brow" counterparts!

There's no dice rolling. There's no card drafting. Both players begin on equal terms - possessing the same number and type of pieces - and have complete control over set-up and positioning. They both will be forced to react and change strategies when they slowly begin to discover the positioning of their opponent's troops - it's fair and balanced with no player having an advantage over the other. This is almost pure abstract strategy - you can't say that about most war games, which are always at the mercy of dice rolls to resolve combat and card drafting to provide resources.

Even if you remain unwavering in your opinion of "Stratego", look at it this way - if nothing else, it's still a great "gateway" game that may ultimately bring other players into your more "high-brow" games... so for that reason alone, all gamers should have a copy lying around their house.

Underrated father of "fog of war" block games that still holds up years later. You arrange your pieces as you like and each player takes turns moving a piece. Bluffing is a major game element, and as pieces are eliminated, the game takes on a deduction aspect as well. The ability to experiment with different army setups leads to a lot of replayability. Also consider Lord of the Ring: Confrontation, which is a superb descendent of Stratego, rethemed and with additional strategy.

This was one of my absolute favorite 2-player games while growing up.  Risk was really uninteresting with 2 players and many of my friends would not play me in chess.  That left Stratego and Battleship to scratch my strategy cravings.  This was always my preferred game.  I like that you have to explore your opponent's strengths and weaknesses.  I also really enjoyed the tactical maneuvering necessary to capture some of your opponent's more important pieces.

Hard to say whether Stratego is a bad game.

I loved this game as a kid.  It was deeper than anything else by Milton Bradley available to me at the time and I was the kind of kid that enjoyed turn-based strategy video games.  Still am.

It just hasn't aged well.  It's too simple for my adult tastes and there is one winning strategy that once you learn it there's not really anything else you can get from this game.

RATING: N/A
We only own Stratego because once upon a time we were desperate for board games and stumbled upon the vintage wooden box collection at Target, on sale. We bought every title available at the time except for Monopoly (out of stock) and Jenga (because we'd both stopped playing board games before 1983 and didn't trust anything but the classics). 

Little did we know that this "grab 'em now and sort it out later!" attitude would foreshadow our game-buying habits a few years later. (Little did we know there were so many other, better, games to buy even then.)

Stratego has yet to be "sorted out". I've never played it. (My 1970s childhood was a bit girly-girl for such serious fare.) I can't even sort out how to pronounce "Stratego" with confidence. 

Someday we'll play it, though, and I'm actually looking forward to seeing how it stands when approached with no past prejudices but plenty of modern gaming experience. Until then, I just keep dusting the bottom shelf of the semi-forgotten corner bookshelf, giving it hope.

RATING: 6
The original "block" wargame?  It certainly must be one of the earliest (and simplest) games to be based around a "fog of war" mechanic.  And where would games like "Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation" be without this old classic?  Unfortunately, for me at least, it just doesn't stand up against the modern games in terms of the fun factor.  Yes it is innovative, well-made, and extraordinarily easy to learn, but there's not quite enough meat there, even for someone like myself who appreciates simpler games.  I think part of the problem is that I just find this game to be rather stressful, with the constant uncertainty in not knowing what you're going up against.  I would rather play the aforementioned "Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation", although even that one I gave to my brother because my wife didn't enjoy it at all.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/4  Total: 6/10

I remember being pretty much blown away by this game when I was about 10. The level of depth and challenge that it offered were like nothing I'd previously experienced. Fast forward almost 25 years and it's a wee bit dry. Pretty fast moving and with a reasonable dose of strategy/tension but there are a lot of other more involved games I'd rather play today.

RATING: 5
[4 plays]  Games seemed like it can be fun but somewhat boring.  A decent game for the common mass distributed games.  It plays at a good pace and can be exciting.  It also can just be frustrating and slow.  You can control some things, but just can be too chaotic.  The "luck" of guessing is not so great. Also it is a bit simple for my tastes. I have had some games go quick and be kind of fun, but some games just drag on and on and are just boring.  Definately not a game I am a huge fan of or request to play very often.

A great wide-area strategic thinking game with a Napoleonic Wars theme. Similar vein as Chess.

Stratego è un gioco pieno d’avventura e di sorprese. Hai a tua disposizione un esercito di pedine composto da militari di rango differente. Tu sei il generale. La tua missione: conquistare la bandiera dell’avversario e difendere la tua. Innanzi tutto devi disporre le tue pedine senza far vedere al tuo avversario come hai disposto il tuo schieramento. Il tuo avversario non deve riuscire a scoprire la strategia che hai adottato per difendere la tua bandiera. Non dimenticare, tuttavia, che devi offire al nemico anche alcune possibilità d’attacco. E ora la battaglia può avere inizio. Devi scoprire quanto è forte il tuo avversario. Sei sicuro che il tuo schieramento sia posizionato bene per resistere al nemico? Sì? E allora è il momento giusto per passare all’attacco.

Extremely important game for the development of the modern gaming industry.  But a very, very bad game as written--needs a rule to encourage attacking.  I think that a rule that you can't move backwards if it would take you behind all enemy units (kind of a "reverse offsides") or something like that is critical to making this game playable.

I remember having fun with this game when I was younger. But since I gave away my copy, I never looked back. The game is okay, but there are better two player games. 30 minutes for a game are possible with minimum think time, I'd say you'd need an hour at least. That is too long for what you can do in this game.

Way too cramped at the start (and too much time spent simply logistically moving your pieces around to give them space to move) and a little dull without much variety in the special powers of each piece.

RATING: 6
Concept: Well, a very nice idea based on several older games; viz.: the jungle game and a French game. 
MECHANICS: Not totally ocnvincing; larger force wins but it remains on the board which sets up some inequalities. Movement not the best, scouts just seem tacked on.
ERGONOMICS: It's works pretty well, game time about 45 min; rules no problem, easy to spot everything.
STRATEGIES: they dont seem complex there is some bluffing and a small amount of managing the movement of pieces.
NARRATIVE: A bit, the pieces come off the board and space opens up. Miners blow up mines, so yes the battle does go in stages.
DRAMA: THere can be some as you race to get the flag.
BRAIN ENGAGE: Just a bit, but I probably want more in a game of this nature. Not bad for the times. 

SUMMARY: Other than lacking originality and lacking any great innovation in the play, it pretty much works for what it is. We still enjoy it and continue to house rule it.

I chuckle every time someone rates Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation highly, while at the same time disparages Stratego. For my money Stratego is the better game with its larger board and lack of unnecessary chrome (i.e., powers). Avoid the newer implementations that try to add on powers.

Stratego is a decent two-player game, involving quite a bit of bluffing.  I don't find it all that fun, though, and its replayability is pretty low.  It just seems to play out the same each time.  It does retain a spot in the closet due to some fond memories of playing it as a kid.

Stratego is another really fun game when you're young. Too much of the game is setting up the board and then getting frustrated when you walk your Marshall into a bomb.

First off, it is important to say that Stratego is about exactly what its name implies, strategy. Now Stratego is not an over complicated game, in fact it is quite simple to learn how to play and to understand the concepts associated with it. However, that may truly be the only downside, it is fun, it is very competitive, the strategy (though simple) is well thought out and can vary greatly from game to game. This game is easily one of my favorite simple games, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

It's a great Strategy game to play! The winner will always be the one that pays attention to the pieces and where everything is located. I wish this could have been 4 players (which I know they in fact DO have a 4 player version of Stratego) but playing with just another person is just as good.

From the darkest corners of my memory:

Several plays under my belt, but I'm starting to agree with others that the only real strategy is to surround your flag with bombs - then it's just a waiting game.

However, if you like Stratego, get Lord of the Rings:The Confrontation.  It's a much better version of this.

The game is slow-paced, monotonous, and I feel hollow when I play it.

Easily the game from my childhood that I like the most. This isn't saying much as rating goes - there are just so many games a lot better this days. But, if I'm asked to play it, I will likely say yes - though probably just as a nod to my younger days.

It's clever. I like to choose the position of the armies and it is fun to advance towards the semi-unkown.

RATING: 7
Under rated game. You must take a look to the World Championships played in europe every year or some online games in Metaforge to check the complex strategy behind this 'kids game'. There is more depth and psicology than many people believe, many strategic deployments available so every game is different, fog of war, cunning bluffing and tactics,...playing this game is like fighting a real battle!. It can be a bit slow for some players, then try out Ultimate Lighting, a faster and even more challenging version!.

Highly valuable game for preschoolers, elementary and even middle school.  Exposes kids to inductive reasoning, specifically what might be called 'subtractive' induction, inference that culls pattern out of clutter, distinguishing ‘signal’ from ‘noise’ (see my review of 'Battleship', which teaches 'additive' induction).  Game promotes planning and optimization skills and the ability to infer an opponent’s intentions and predict and anticipate his impending moves.  Since such predictions should be predicated upon hypotheses concerning the opponent's dispositions, the game promotes deductive inference (‘hypothetico-deductive’, technically) as well as inductive.

Also teaches and depicts basic officer/NCO types in Napoleonic warfare (de rigueur, therefore, for future wargamers!).

Strongly recommended, along with ‘Battleship’, ‘Clue’ and ‘Monopoly’ as part of a basic suite of cognitive-developmental games for young people.

Stratego is a fun, classic strategy game. The best part is not knowing what you are coming up against and finding ways to discover what it is before risking your best pieces. It is also insanely fun to bluff and chase your opponent around with your weakest pieces...if they let you.

This one gets unfairly labeled as a "kids game" too often.  Nice if you want to play a fast pseudo-abstract game.  Mind games can be interesting.  "He's been moving that piece like it's his miner, but he could be a decoy for the real miner who's behind it, or he could be trying to disguise a very strong attack until he is deep into my territory and I can no longer respond."  I like how easy this one is to explain, and how elegant the design really is.  Everything's intuitive.

This is a great simple game.  Was easily able to explain it to my 8 year old.  After just one game, and a couple simple tips, she devised strategies and misconceptions that allow her to give me a challenge at 38 years old.  Fun, fun, fun.  Just as cool as I remembered.

I love Stratego, but this is more nostalgia than anything else.  Despite the name, it is almost entirely tactics rather than strategy.  I enjoyed evolving cunning ruses, such as the Spy Ambush and the Bomb Bluff, but there just isn't quite enough strategic thinking to make the experience really interesting.

RATING: 5
As a kid, I had always thought of this as a chess game that actually made sense. There aren't a whole lot of different set-up strategies to use and gameplay is the very definition of simplicity, which keeps this in the category of family games. Still, the fog of war aspect works better here than it does in Battleship's tedious approach.

My absolute favorite as a kid, and despite all the hobby gaming goodness I've discovered in the last few years, still my favorite today. It's the only one I honestly don't think I could ever get sick of (as much as I love some of the games I've rated 9, I could see myself getting burned out on any of them). From the possibilities in the opening setup to the strategic movement of troops to the tension raised by bluffs to the metagame when playing with the same opponent, this game has a lot to offer, even 60+ years later.

While flawed in a few ways, I still like and respect this game a lot.  I have fond memories of spending the afternoon drawing up the perfect set up and battle plan on graph paper, then bugging my dad until he played with me.

After years of not playing, my wife and I got really into Stratego for a short while.  There are tons of variants online, and we had a lot of fun mixing matching them (and making up our own), then talking about what worked and what didn't.

The new 10-2 piece rankings are an abomination.  Fortunately, we rescued my old copy from my parents.  The "vintage" sets at Target also have the old rankings, if you're looking for them.

I always thought this looked like a fun game growing up, but never had (or took) the opportunity to play it.  Finally, when my son was 10 or so we finally got it and I played it with him.

I enjoyed it the first time or two.  But ... is that all there is?  I was expecting more.    It's not that I DON'T like it, but it just doesn't grab me.

I never have the urge to play, but my son likes it much more than me (he's 18 now) so he suggests it from time to time.  Often I'll agree because I hate to turn down ANY game.  But sometimes I just can't muster the interest to play it.

Played this so many times as a kid and haven't played since. I swear that bomb moved before I attacked with my admiral. Every aspect of this game is brilliant.

Stratego is not deep, but I like hide-and-seek and bluffing...and this game has them both in the most basic way. 

It does not fall under the designer label of games or anything as superior as that, but it is fun at the right time. I would not suggest a game of it, but neither would I turn down a game if someone wanted to play it.

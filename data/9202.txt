RATING: 6
An "area control" card game with a fairly original set of interlocking mechanics.  I've only played twice (2-player) so far and I found it difficult to plan ahead.  My rating reflects this.  With experience, however, I'm guessing that the game will sort itself out, and I wouldn't be surprised if my rating goes up.

I'm glad I played this, but I'm not sure what to make of it. The game itself is quite simple. I just don't think I like the timing aspects that make up the game. I need to try it with two, as three player seems to be the most boring number (all players get two kingdoms before starting to attack each other). Not horrific, but there are so many other games out there that I find to be much more appealing.

My local game shop owner tipped me off about this one.  Quite easy to play, although there are a few powers of the different lands that it's worth memorising first.  If you like Babel or Battle-Line, you may well like this because it shares competition across a board for a plot of land.  In many ways, this is the mirror-image of Babel -in that the cards have the special powers, in this the lands do.  Like in B-Line, you have to do better on a land than your opponent.  Unlike B-Line, you can bounce back and retake it if you lose one in this. A good two player and my wife enjoys it.

Excellent game mechanics, though the theme is very thin.

Its completely determininstic, which means that the 2 player game is 100% skill, while the only factor in a multiplayer game is the multiplayer randomness element. The board setup is random however, so its always different.

Heavy on the strategy, light on tactics...except maybe timing the endgame, but you can see that coming.

My opinion of Saga has increased considerably since my first review! Very attractive(albeit unrealistic)cards in this quasi-Mediaeval game. The rules system works very well, but one must memorize the attributes of all the kingdoms to plot an effective strategy. And it is definitely a strategy game, with luck playing exceedingly little part. This is a fun game; it would be a lot more exciting if it was more realisticly themed. In spite of that, I doubt I'll ever turn down an offer to play it. It certainly has the potential to drag, but the excitement level does tend to rise as it enters the end-game phase.

A different card game, that eliminates luck. You get all your cards on the hand and the decks are pre-constructed.

Basically a more than average good game, but the minus points for cards in your hand can be killing. An attack on your lands in the last few rounds cost you a lot of points, while you have little possibility to increase the defence of your land.

RATING: 6
Hard to rate on one play.  The rules and gameplay seemed sufficiently straightforward for a small box game but the warning about how the game might feel like it will never end certainly gave us humorous pause.  I haven't looked at the starting hands, I only know that they're different.  With the varying values of the various cities or whatever they are it's hard to imagine how certain starting positions aren't better than others.  Lots of back and forth and simple card play, worth another try sometime.

This is a slick variant on the classic war card game.  Players compete with cards to conquer various kingdoms.  Interesting card reqruitment mechanism adds to game play experience.  Despite the improvements, the game is still limited in depth.  It is listed as playable by 4, but it works best as a 2-player game.  [GTI Code: AGCL]

The ebb and flow to this game remind me of Risk where one player dominates the board only to have the next player wipe out all that progress and become the new dominant.  This cycle repeats over and over making the game feel longer than it actually is.  The premise is simple and interesting, but I think the execution is slightly lacking.

Another solid game by Wolfgang Kramer. The rules and mechanisms may seem overly simple when you first play it. But first impressions are certainly deceitfull. You have to plan your strategy very carefully. And don't dare to lose track of what other players are doing or you'll have no chance whatsoever.

Seems interesting so far after one play.  It feels like your manipulating the play area very indirectly.  To be more specific like your affecting one element which is affect another and then another, the last one being the one that scores you points, but can't exactly put your finger on (I can't at this point).  Seems like it might be too chaotic with four, maybe even with three.  I like the two-player game though (only one I've played).

Obtained at BGG.CON give-away. 
One play. A fairly big game in a small box! It was engaging for the kids because of the mideavel theme. It also provides a level of conflict that is not too devastating for any one player, with kingdoms changing hands often early on until defenses become more stout. Another plus for the youngsters is that a player must plan attacks through calculating numbers in hand to overwhelm defenses. Bits are nice, with artwork well done. Best free game I've played.

So after owning this game since January 07 I finally played it (2/10/10)  3 YEARS!

It wasn;t a bad game, and since I hadn't read the rules since like a year ago or more the factthat I picked it up so fast is amazing.  Seems like a nice enough little filler for during lunch.  Play it a few times and we will have some better strategies.  Not the best game in the world, so I might end up giving it a higher grade.

4/24/14--I have repurposed this game. I am now using the cards as bookmarks. We couldn't sell it, and I didn't want to throw it away. The card art was really the only good thing about the game anyway, so now I get to enjoy the art without having to play the game.

Production: Well-produced, though I would have preferred coins to tiles for the money.  The symbols for the location special powers take some getting used to.  Play: The game is a bit befuddling on the first go, as there doesn't seem to be much point to capturing a location that will only net one a few victory points before it gets stolen away.  And what one can target is partially determined by which suits one has in hand, and thus it is not always possible to target the leading player.  But on a second play, though I still didn't see a way to set myself up for an optimal, game-winning move, I did enjoy it more.(1+0+2) (2 plays)

Dry and simple. The actual attacker/defender mechanism is a distraction since the game is primarily driven by the pace and timing of the endgame. A player which ends the game with a good number of strongly held lands is likely to win over any players just chasing points through the game. I suspect this will end as a 5 for me, but at the moment I'm intrigued by the pace & timing aspect.

Players are princes competing to conquer (and hold) six different kingdoms.  Kingdoms are taken by playing knight cards from your hand over a series of turns, first taken from the table, then eventually from the other players.  Kingdoms earn victory points each turn while held, and earn more at the end based on the size of the defending force. Some kingdoms have "rule breaker" abilities built into them.  Works okay, but I was glad when it was over.  Bland and rather forgettable.

very interesting, and somewhat fast paced.  in the games we've played so far, I think the winner is based more in luck, and haven't determined a good strategy so far, as it depends on who's getting picked on often.  Buy those 4 point cards when you can.

I've only played this game once, so take my rating for what it's worth. After playing for about 90 minutes, neither of us was any closer to winning the game than when we started. It seems to me that unless one player is quite a bit better than the other, the game will go on forever. And ever. Obviously this can't be true, so we studied the rules trying to find some small rule or clause or exception that we had missed... but to no avail. We finally just quit playing. Maybe this was a weird coincidence, maybe it was due to the starting decks we chose (which were too similar in terms of strengths and weaknesses) or maybe this is typical for a two player game.To be honest, I wasn't crazy about the artwork either, and the theme felt incredibly tacked on- even more so than, say, a Knizia game. Why exactly are all possible factions lining up against each other? And why can't the same color (faction) appear in any attacking force more than once? Who are all these weird people, anyway, and why do they form up for combat so randomly? Yes, it's just a game, but the theme felt weak to me.I wouldn't mind getting this one to the table again some time, especially with 3 or more players, just to see if our experience is better. Still, my motivation to do so isn't particularly high. There are so many other games out there...

* Played 5+ times. Stinks for 2 players; the nil-sum factor reducing the game to a tit-for-tat exercise. With 3 I found the game fairly engaging. Still, this game is as dry as a bone, the fantasy theme is utterly devoid of any atmospheric addition, and the "special" abilities are few and boring. This is a numbered card game -- that simple. It has a bit of interest to it, but isn't going to make too many Top 10 lists. Unfortunately, this is the BEST game in the new Kosmos/Uberplay series. [f-out(PowerPlay in)]

Mmm.   Gameplay is interesting; the choices are there for the making; it flows well and the components are nice.  How does this add up to a game that does not know when to stop?!?

A good filler game. Very easy to teach. Players play cards to try to capture control of 6 different "kingdoms". Once they capture a kingdom, they become the defender.

I'm not completely sold on this game, but I'm also not discounting it until I've had a chance to play again. It offers some decent strategic gameplay and rewards those who plan their moves in advance. By the time I started to get a feel for it, someone had gone out, sticking me with several cards in my hand. There just seems to be something missing here. The game table was very quiet while we played, and then it was over.

Pointless, drawn out, see-saw battle with provinces changing hands again and again and again and again until the game mercifully ends.  It's who owns the provinces in the end that counts, but there's not much ability to plan for that.  This is the type of game in which attacking is easy and defending is impossible, so the player who is picked on the least wins.  And this is supposed to be the *best* of the new tinybox Kosmos/Uberplay line?  I guess I won't go out of my way to try the others.

RATING: 4
An interesting hand management game, but I think it might play too long for what it is.

Each player has a similar (identical? I don't remember.) set of cards of knights. These knights are played to conquer kingdoms, and the kingdoms grant abilities as well as award points at the end of the game. Players are very limited on what they can do each turn, so you have to plan and watch carefully to make sure you can build up the strength necessary to conquer a kingdom. I liked that aspect of it.

What I didn't like was the game-ending conditions, which were for one player to play all of their cards. This seems benign, but in practice takes longer than I would like. Each time a person takes a kingdom card, they place it with their (now defending) knight army in front of them. If another player later takes that kingdom, the defending knights go *back in the players's hand*. Eventually, players build up armies large enough to either not be taken or end the game, but it just seemed tedious.

I wasn't thrilled by the game, but I would be willing to try it again. We played with the beginner set up, and I would like to see the effect of the more advanced kingdom abilities.

A rare luck-free cardgame. The mechanics seem flawed at first, but they surprisingly work. The main problem is that too much relies on the endgame, as lots of points are given for the lands you have. And because cards return to your hand and count negative points, you lose twice if a land is taken from you in the last round.

My feeling is that this would drop even more in the ratings after more plays. I didn't quite understand what I was trying to do or when to purchase the cards. That choice and the choice of which card to go for are the only choices to make and it just ends up being tug of war. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't anything special and I know I wouldn't play it that often.

1st played 10/17/07. Taught in ~5min, played in ~30min w/ 4 players. Game has good luck/strategy balance. Goal is to gain the most fame pts by taking over as many of the 6 countries(each has a special power) you can. Deck has 5 sets of cards(symbols on back). Each player gets a set. Use Castle set as initial defense for the countries, w/ each getting 2 cards(1st w/ same color as country & as different color; otherwise random). Turn summary: 1) receive designated fame pts for all counties owned, 2) create a new/expand attack force against a country, 1 card per turn(only 1 force at a time; 1st card played designates which country is under attack; each must be a different color), 3) hire a free knight(pay card # value in fame points; can be played immediately). 4) once your attack force has more card pts than defenders, you(those cards you played) become the new defender. If at the start of your next turn you own a country, you get it's special ability. If you lose a country to another player, your cards go back into your hand. If board loses, their defenders become free knights. Game ends when someone has all of their cards in play. Final scoring(some lands change scoring): fame pts plus sum of all defense cards - cards in hand. Recommended borrow, not purchase.

After 4 games, I can say, the game is better with 3 or more. With 2 it's not realy that special, but not totaly lost. 

But rating up because it was nice to play with 3!

After a couple of more plays, still same opinion. We play it with 2 aswell, but its just not my favourite. I think best is with 3 or 4.

I just really didn't enjoy the fundamental mechanics of this game.  You are trying to seize control of "kingdoms" that pay income during the game and big bonuses at the end of the game.

Unfortunately, it used a very "tug-of-war" mechanic.  When someone steals a kingdom from you, you get back all of the resources you used to claim it originally.

It just didn't feel fluid and fun to me.

I had high hopes for this as I always do with Kramer's games, but this one dissappointed. The theme is tacked on and virtually non-existent and the card play is dull.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (May 2011)

The first time we played Saga, we played wrong a critical rule so the game was very bad. Luckily we played it again and I found do like the game (thus the increased rating). It has some very interesting mechanics although the theme is paper thin. It has very low luck (which I like). As it is simply to teach and has a short play time it serves well as a confrontational filler a la Battle Line but with more players.

Now I am officially a fan of Mr. Kramer.

Almost 3 years went by without playing Saga but I was able to remember the rules correctly :D. I still enjoy the game but it isn’t a game I would like to play often. I really like that if you forget to claim VPs you forfeit them :devil:, I have never seen that in a game and in every one of my games this has brought laughs to the table as it is very easy to forget. Saga is easy to teach but it has some interesting decisions and I have fun playing it. I have only played the basic version but I look forward to play with the alternate kingdoms. 

In these 3 years, my gaming taste have changed a lot, I suspect if Saga were a new game to me this year I would have rated it a lot lower. 

On the bad side, the player with most kingdoms at the end will win most of the time with little regard to the VPs gathered during the game. Planning for this can be hard because it depends a lot on who the players are attacking. The winning player usually wins by a huge difference.

Bottom line, Saga can be a fun game to play from time to time. I’m downgrading its rating to 6.0. A rating that currently matches my feelings for the game  with BGG´s recommended rating system.

Another 3 years have passed and I managed to finally play Saga again, this time with the advanced mode. It isn’t really an advanced mode, the lands have different powers now and that´s all. It is a nice to have feature as it adds to the replayability of the game and you can mix them as you which, still, Saga is a very light game and I don’t like (most) light strategy games so I’m downgrading its rating again.

It is a decent filler and an ok game to teach new gamers, but my desire to play Saga again is low. I will sell my copy of the game ASAP.

A light Wolfgang Kramer timing game with multi-layered strategies.  It's  a "card game that is a boardgame", involving card mgmt. mechanics, where one is dueling (capture & re-capture) for six kingdoms against other players; timing when the game ends (by you or others) is very important (similar dueling like Tribune).  Interested in trying the advanced rules with experienced players.

Low BGG Rating and Avg. user score, by this review looks favorable, drawing comparisons to Lost Cities:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/287860/lost-castles

Comments say it has a Battlelines, Coloretto feel to it.

Vasel speaks positively on this game: "Even though Saga plays okay with two players, it really shines as a multiplayer game, and I have to say that it is my favorite of the Uberplay small box series."

Appelcline gives it a 4/4 saying: "Saga is an interesting combination of majority-control mechanics with card gameplay. There's some possibility for late-game chaos to sneak in if you're not careful, but otherwise the game is an interesting, unique, and thought-provoking experience. "

First I want to say I cannot believe people play this with just two players.  It's an awful two-player game that feels like an advanced version of war.  With three it plays OK but still it's a huge disappointment (with the name Kramer on the box).  Players build armies (with cards) & vie to control six countries each with special powers and VP values.  Just doesn't do it for me and I expect it wouldn't have much replay value for most groups.

Finally had a chance to get this on the table (2-player) after a lengthy bout of game-shelf purgatory.  And it's quite good.  There is a definite and delicate balance between investing too much in a single Land vs. leaving it to your opponent for too long.

I only wonder about the strength of Goldland, though.  The fact that it's worth at least 2 points per turn vs. 1 point for all the rest might make it so powerful that much of the game revolves around shuttling it back and forth.

This game has a lot of depth. We only played one game with the intro setting for the countries (the side of the country cards with the small crown icon in the upper left hand corner) ... we should have played with the other side of the cards so that the "special actions" would have been more varied. I want to try it again as soon as I get a chance, but not with the intro setings for the country cards.

I've played 5 times. Turns are quick enough to allow it to move into almost filler territory, but the game itself is a touch long for it, so it falls into awkward territory. Ending the game is powerful, and everyone needs to be watchful and ensure everyone is always under attack. If one player's piles are not under attack during the mid-game (and thus cards not returning to their hand), you'll find the game ends very quickly with a win to them as they play out their last cards. Which means huge potential for king making as the end-game draws. Hence not a higher rating.

RATING: 6
This game feels a little like backwards hot-potato: the "kingdoms" pass around among the players, and when the game ends, whoever happens to have the best ones wins.  I didn't really feel like there was much you could do to stop your opponents from taking kingdoms.  I'm not sure if "buying" the cards in the middle is worth it or even relevant.  The only competitive players in the end were the player who went out and the player who happened to have the kingdom that eliminated the cards-in-hand penalty.

D described this game as "high-brow War" and I think he wasn't too far off the mark. You're vying for kingdoms using numerical cards in various colors. Lots of exchanging to collect chips, which got a little tedious. The game, which is only about 20 minutes long, felt a little draggy. All that said, D liked it so I guess it's a keeper for now.

A cardgame with some silly artwork (no knight would EVER hold a sword like that), and strange rules. Why would a knight from a forest not be able to fight in a land with only hills?
Having said that, it can be okay to play. I'd advise having multiple players. With only two, this one could bore quickly

Played once. Box arrived with both the yellow and red castle cards missing. Since Uberplay is more or less out of business, I had to hand-make replacements. Not a big deal really - it would have been worse to be missing knight cards, since those are probably not detailed anywhere (whereas the castle cards have plenty of pictures and descriptions in the rules).

The game itself seems okay, need a few more plays to really decide what I think of it.

Este é um jogo que tinha tudo para ser um grande jogo e que se perdeu algures pelo caminho! Continuamos a ter um jogo agradável, mas fica a ideia de que a uma mecânica tão forte, tinha de ser adicionada mais qualquer coisa, uma maior complexidade, um tabuleiro modular, enfim, algo que lhe conferisse o toque de sofisticação que lhe falta, pois até as características dos territórios cheiram a pouco, pois podiam ter sido muito mais exploradas. É fantástica a forma como nos sentimos dentro de uma batalha e a tirar proveito das particularidades do reino, é essa a magia de Saga. Regras muito simples e claras, ensina-se em instantes, joga-se em 30 minutos e é até capaz de voltar a apetecer jogar...

Rating after one play.  Despite the strategy note assuring me the game wouldn't really take forever, it felt that way most of the game.

Interesting, but no home run.

I've played this game twice, and I still can't decide if I like it or not. It is certainly unique for a filler. Saga contains way more depth than you would think at first glance, and I believe it finally clicked for me after this second play. There's a lot of thought needed for card placement, and a careful eye that's ready to start a counter attack when necessary. My one negative comment regards the art: it's horrible! Corners were definitely cut, which is a shame. I think good-great art would have opened this game up to a wider audience and the appreciation it deserves as a solid filler.

This game gets alot flak. Personally, I think it's strengths lie in the fact that it works well 2 players as well as 3 and 4.

The theme is paper thin: players vying for control of the land. The mechanics are Kniza-esqe. Number stacking with bonuses for different sort of terrain and troops. 

Found this one fairly tense. Can be prone to AP though.

I came late and had to sit through and watch a miserable session of this game.  As a four player game it was completely chaotic.  Everyone hated it and for years never got the chance to play it.  Finally, a different player that hated it as a two player game but wasn't ready to give up on it brought his copy to play.  A player from the aformentioned 4 player game finally bucked and joined us for a three player game.   All of us finished the game up realizing that this should only be played as a three player game (I wonder how many people's experience was ruined because of it).

That said, it still isn't all that stellar.  

It is a decent numbers game, where the timing of playing out all of your cards is everything.  I hate the "if you forget your VP's you lose them" element of the game.  Does this make it any more fun or interesting?  There are hundreds of other games that I'd rather spend my time on. This game could have been called many things, but Saga just isn't appropriate for this light and abstract of a system.

This really feels that this was a side mechanic to another grander design, and after the two designers couldn't figure out where to port it, they sold it as is without trying to find a way to make it worthwhile.

This is a fun filler that has a little of everything.

Saga is a cleverly crafted game...something I admire about most Kramer games, but ultimately, this game just does not provide the same adrenalin rush or tension that I crave for. For one thing, the game play drags on and there isn't a whole lot of suspense since the attacking forces are all in plain view. So, you know roughly who is targeting what kingdom. This allows you to plan better moves, but also makes it a little repetitive and predictable. But the killer for me is that this game is 15 minutes longer than it should be. If the game is a little shorter, then, it is a perfect filler. With four players, this game took more than 30 minutes. A tad too long. As my friend commented, this is a game that "requires a beer and an evening". Yikes!  Will play if asked, but doubtful if I would ever ask for it myself.

Play cards to the table to defeat the defending strength and win provinces, which then give you benefits such as victory points as income, or special skills for as long as you hold them. Interestingly, your attack force becomes the defensive strength for retaining the province, so smart play can help prevent provinces from ping-ponging back and forth between players.

Much better than I thought it would be, given the low ratings here on BGG.

F.
Замечательная компактная игра. Продуманный геймплей. Немного неакцентированно прописаны правила. Если торопиться и пропустить обычно малопринципиальное выражение "as soon as..." в начале предложения, то можно при освоении забыть забрать королевство, а копить атакующие силы, чтобы потом была мощнее защита. 
Очень тактическая игра. Немного даже на нервах: у кого первого сдадут. Иногда бывает понятно кто выиграл за две-три (оставшиеся) карты до конца. А иногда разница видна только при окончательном подсчете. Так или иначе, последние ходы продумываются с непременным отсылом к подсчету финальных очков при том или ином варианте.
Средний балл по BGG-больнице удивляет. Солидный, несуетливый, вдумчивый филлер с задатками основной игры (2-4 партии за вечер со сменой комплектов лыцарей между игроками). Крамер веников не вяжет.

Wolfgang Kramer & Horst-Rainer Rösner; In an empire consisting of six countries, each player incorporates a prince who tries to free the countries from the evil ruler with the help of his or her troops. In each round, players lay out knights before them who have different strength values. The color of the knight symbolizes the country one wants to conquer. If one lays down further knights of the same color in later rounds, they will be arranged in a row below each other. It is important that only one knight per color may be part of the conquering squad.To conquer a country, one needs a knight with a higher strength number as the one defending it. Once a country has been conquered, the former owner receives his or her knight cards back. However, the other players will try to conquer the country anew by laying down knights with higher overall strength. They also must bear in mind the different special functions of each country. Most countries serve as income sources; some enable the player to enforce his defense troops and so on.At the end of the game, you will receive a “general rating.” The player owning a country receives the sum of his defense knight’s value points in that country. Cards that have not been used will earn minus points. The player who now owns the highest amount of money wins the game and becomes the new king!

RATING: 4
This game may not be best realized with 2 players, since there never seems to be a good reason to pick up a free knight.  It's all about racing to the end of the hand and being the first to go out.  Timing is important, since gaining the 2-point land early means that you would have an advantage over the other player, but a lot of the "when" is dictated by the cards in your hand.  There's some variety in the different decks, but it seems to be one of those odd games that's too deterministic with just 2 players, but too chaotic with more (so I'm guessing).  On the other hand, I can see that playing the game with the same player could reveal a hidden depth as players try different tactics against familiar players.

The best of the new small, square box series from Uberplay. Nice theme that appeals to fantasy gamers, but some very solid mechanisms and and "end-game" that works very well as when you are overtaken and lose a scoring card you must pick up those cards and they count against you, so there's a nice back-and-forth to try to get the upper-hand and bring things to an end.

It's got cards with different colours, and it's fun - so it reminds me of Coloretto. Except the cards also have numbers, so the game should be called "Colour and Numberetto".

Don't know much about it.  It was a throw in from a trade I did...but I have a feeling it will be difficult to get to the table...

Passed it on to a better place.

Only played 2P, it's a fine game for the time investment. (Very short 2P) I didn't feel like it was a particularly deep game or that you could develop any sort of strategy. (More of a tactical, react type of game that only took 15 minutes or so)

Ultimately I think I'd rather invest a little more time and play something deeper. In a way this kind of reminds me of a 2P Battle Line.

I played SAGA once several years ago and had the same feeling that I could not figure out when was the best time to capture kingdoms and be able to retain them. It was frustrating. I don't know that more plays would help much.

Fun little game. A filler with low luck but moderate chaos due to opponent's moves disrupting your plans. Nice artwork on the cards. Fairly high stategy considering how short it is. I would rank it a lot higher, but even though it's fun it just doesn't grab me like other games, I'm not sure why! Still definitely worth owning and playing.

Good game just not enough players to play it.

Amusing enough.  Players contend for control of certain kingdoms that grant points and/or special powers.  Depending on the kingdom, points are scored each turn or at game end.

Only got to play it once.  My guess is that it is horribly broken, but I won't get a chance to play a 2nd time to find out :(

I liked the little guy after my only play, and would've given it a 6, but I'm going to assume I'm semi-correct and it stops being an actual game after 2 or 3 plays.

It's interesting, at least. Not too bad at all, seems fairly balanced, but it doesn't really pop for me.

As Her Schloesser mentions in his review, the key words here are "learning curve". I keep preparing strategies, being poised to strike a fatal blow... and having somebody end the round, and me with my "dream cards" in hand counting negative. Nice :)

I don't know what to make of Saga.  It seems like it's decent, but something about it annoys me.  I think that it goes on too long for what it is, and it's not quite interesting enough for its length.  I'd like to play it again, though, to see if what I recollect is true.

There's a lot of swiping from each other, and everybody's first game includes a brief moment in which they ask, "Will this ever end?" because the swipefest seems to hinder progress; however, the game can end rather unexpectedly and brutally.  This game feels unique, holding a special allure when it comes time to select a game to play.

Seems kind of random.  Despite what the rules say, our second game seemed to just go back and forth.

The game is not that bad, but is visually very displeasing. They should have printed the player symbols on both side of  the cards.

After 1 Play: With two players, the game just didn't work very well.  I could see it improving a little with more players.

Very simple mechanics but still has some strategic choices to make. The theme is extremely light, so not my kind of game in that respect.

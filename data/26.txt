Probably, the most played game of my life. Most of my all life friends (gamers and non gamers) have gone through it. All the memories associated with this game put it in my Top 1. Great mechanics as well, mixing civilization advancements with area controlling, economics, diplomacy...all in one!

If you like Civilization, you should like this game. Better than Civalization on game play and time needed to finished it. Fun too. This is not a sequence to Civilization or an expension, it is a total different game. But some of the mechanics is simular to Civilization.

Not a bad game, but the rules are long and heavy.  I'd rather play two (or four!) shorter games for my time.

I will play this again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

I've played a second go of this one and I think there might be just a bit of a broken system here (the "combat" for instance has no defense to it, no way to counter or "bulk up" your forces).

I've lowered my score on this one.  It's way too long for what it is, the bits are figity and a pain to keep track of and the game just doesn't seem to sit well with me.

RATING: 7
This is an overly complex design that masks a very good game. The thematic flavour (gotta love the Misery Index!) is there and the map and components are wonderful.
Like a lot of Avalon Hill titles AoR can take too long to play, but once all players are familiar with the rules, strategies and board, play can actually progress quite quickly.
There is a better setup system and changes to the mapboard online that should be implemented fully as they are basically the never-published 2nd Edition rules/map that balance and enhance gameplay significantly.
Frankly, I think anything less than a full 6-player game is lacking. If you&#039;re going to invest this many hours (5+) in a game you might as well make it a fully loaded affair.
A really nice part of the game is the options for advancement of your faction. Divergence in the late game is common and that makes for some interesting outcomes that are almost never expected.

RATING: 10
PROS:
*) Some clever mechanics
*) Wonderful "empire building" feeling
*) Requires long-term strategy, not only turn-to-turn thinking
*) Very nice board and pieces

CONS:
*) Badly written rulebook (-> use my re-written rulebook in the Links section)
*) Rather complicated rules
*) A lot of book-keeping
*) Takes very long (if you don't like that)
*) Some quite random elements (combat, cards drawn) Strangely - and I don't know why - they don't really bother me in this game.

SUMMARY:
If you don't mind length and the somewhat complicated rules, this is real fun. I advise 4 players at least.

PS:
Upgraded from 8 to 9 after my first 6-Player game. Because of the mechanics, a 6-player game does not take much longer than a game with less players, but is sure more fun!

Enjoyable game that has many of the elements of Advanced Civilization, but with a quicker play time. Gotta love it when the Black Death card appears and everyone around the table avoids eye contact! Can handle up to 6 players, but probably best with 5.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating after one play with 6 players.  Like many civ games, shines with more players.  On the other hand with 6 players my first game took 7.5 hours.  Like many games of this depth, the first time you play you are going to get smoked.  Much more forgiving than Civilization, you can get knocked down and come back.

This game turned out to be quite a bit of fun.  In some ways, it reminds me a bit of Power Grid: at its heart, it feels like an economic growth game, as opposed to a conquest game.

First game took just about 6 hours, but I suspect with experienced players it would take a bit less time.

I'd definitely play this again.

Very good game if you look for a heavy Civilization-like game. Plays faster (3-4 hours) if you only play the 2 first epochs.

I've had to lower this rating. After my first few plays I really thought this game  was going to be an all time favorite, but then I started seeing the dark side of its soul. The general gameplay is superb; one of the most elegant designs I've seen. The trouble is in the random events -- they are so powerful that they imbalance the game. Black Death, for example, will end any hope of winning for the player lucky enough to get hit with it. That's *one card* that puts an end to 7+ hours of gaming no matter how well you've played to that point. There are more "pain" cards that have lesser, yet similarly broken, effects. My suspicion is that this game retains its popularity by nostalgia alone. In my opinion there will always be a better way to spend a day than waiting to see who gets the right event cards. You could play a few turns at a roullette wheel and have the same experience in a fraction of the time

My friends and I were playing [i][gameid=224][/i] and [i][gameid=177][/i] on a regular basis when we tried this. Maybe there is a good game hiding under the overly-complex and poorly-written rules, but no one wanted to spend the months it seemed it would take to get all the clarifications.

RATING: 8.5
A game I liked very much when it first came out and still enjoy today. It scales the size of map to the number of players, which was a relatively unique thing for its day and it works well, but the game cries out to be played by a full compliment. However, it is a long game and some of the "event" cards verge on being broken (we either omit a couple of these or do a card draft before play starts).

The game was considered to be a streamlined sequel to "Civilization," and by eliminating the commodity/calamity card collection mechanic, along with the trading and calamity resolution phases, the game was considerably shorter to play than its predecessor. The changes all work together seamlessly and the change to a non-deterministic combat system added a degree of suspense that added interest from the much drier version in Civ. Going to an "event card" system coupled with regional commodity production is an effective way to retain an interesting economic model.

I'm always puzzled by the many references I see to the "fiddlyness" of the economics. We've never found that, and anyone who wrestled with the commodity combos and card discounts of Civ to figure out what one can afford should find this game considerably simpler.

An even more streamlined version was intended in Manifest Destiny, but after a few playings I've concluded that the original AoR is easily the superior game. It is possible to streamline something to death or beyond recognition...

This game is a classic from a great boardgame company (Avalon Hill) at its peak and one still worthy of play by serious gamers; but, owing to its still considerable length, not for everyone.

Tremendous update of Civilization.  I  must have played this near 100 times, with some of the elite cult-players of this game, and I could still explore and explore it. 

It could use some cleaning up for a new edition, particularly in production value, and to balance a few factors.

RATING: 7
This game has alot going on and I really like most of it. It would be great if there were a little less randomness I think, but the balance of the game makes up for a bit of it. It's totally worth the time investment of playing. Being in possession of long fingernails that are unable to pick up the chits gets incredibly annoying when winning or losing multiple areas, so the fiddliness can get in the way for me.

Last time I played we used some variant rules that help this game a lot.  But the fact that you need variant rules and house rules just to make the game work  are the most obvious symptoms that the game has some huge flaws.  Remove the war card from the game altogether.  Remove Crusades, Silk, Spice, Walter the Penniless, Rashid al Din, and Civil War cards from the initial deal. Deal each player 3 cards, and let them choose one to be their first card, then reshuffle the discards back into the deck. This made for a much better game as suddenly nobody has a huge head start with the crusades.  If anyone gets a huge head start with the crusades they should be whacked mercilessly but often aren't sufficiently. As far as empire building games go, this one isn't very good compared to many others in that category.  Feels more like a whack-em card game similar to Nuclear War or Mille Bornes but with a six+ hour playing time. There's only one strategy, cards that are too powerful, and very little replayability. Hamburg almost unusable it's so broken.  I bought this game in 1996 and we played it a couple times with three players, and then we got into computer games and I didn't buy another board game for six years!  Playing it again after all that time made me realize this game is just frustrating, tedius, dull, and not very interesting.

RATING: 4
A game that I enjoyed for about 5 plays, after which I was just done and never wanted to see the stupid thing again. Definitely play just two epochs; the third epoch dramatically lengthens the game for little real purpose. This was certainly a much better game circa 1996, when the competition was not so stiff. Today, the cards are hugely unbalancing, the accounting is tedious, the game is too long for too little point, and there is too much arbitrary hosage a la Nuclear War (not that I don't like Nuclear War ... but that is at least a short & simple game. Games that are essentially just random whine-fests can work, but they have to be short). Better than ACiv just due to the more moderate length, but still a hugely overrated game IMHO as AH finally managed to flush all the good qualities out of Civilization.

I'm was very dubious if I was playing a masterpiece or a rotten relict of the '90s.
But in the end ... long playing time, tedious and over-necessary book-keeping, detract a lot from the eniojment of playing this one. Choosing the right commodity is critical to victory, even if the luck factor can keep even the most able player away from victory. Map, counters and cards, are just too colorful and what is gorgeous for someone is just plain color garbage for someone else (I'm in the someone else field)

The sequel to Civilization... unfortunately, after dozens of plays, you'll find it is a bit too heavily influenced by luck.  This doesn't stop me from enjoying it immensely, but remember that the people who get Crusades or Spice are very likely to win.  I should write a guide on this thing - we've played it to death.  If you ever get the chance and love Civilization, have a go.  You'll love it.

RATING: 8
After playing countless, forgettable German/European games (the MTV of gaming) I forgot how nourishing and rewarding games of this depth and length can be.  AoR is long, demanding, and dense but if you take the time to learn to play it's a terrific experience marred only by some cumbersome accounting procedures and some pretty wild swings of fortune generated by cardplay.  Most gamers minted post-Rio Grande Games will balk at the amount of attention and patience the game requires, but that's their loss- give 'em Hansa, it'll keep them quiet for 30 minutes or so.  I took this rating down one after playing Manifest Destiny- same system with a lot of the more cumbersome elements removed.

The last game I bought from the late great Avalon Hill before they were absorbed by the Hasborg Collective. I still have not played it in 13+ years. One of these days though...

Ok, one of these days finally arrived and I wished it never had. I hate this game! I hate it down to deepest pits of my soul. It is an unbalanced piece of crap that sucked 8 hours of my life away. I was Genoa and was hit by Civil War on turn two. This stupid card put me out of the damn game. I lost half my units, my capital was reduced, and I had to go last. I had bid fairly low (10 I think) to go early and make a grab for a couple of places. Now I had only 5 and went from 2nd to last. I ended rebuilding my capital and using the one left over unit to get some toe hold on some useless territory. 

I had to sit there for another 7 or 8 hours or pain, torment, and sorrow knowing I had no chance at all. 

The stupid unbalanced piece of shit card destroyed any chance I had of catching up. I had to sit there as all the other players had a jolly old time getting to take over cool territories and I got stuck with the three lousy Stone locations and a few other ancillary places. 

In a game like this the first few turns is critical. If you get knocked too hard you are always behind with no chance of recovery. This bullshit "take that" over powered card can ruin a persons game and destin them to hours of drudgery.

Never again! I am tempted to burn my copy I am so pissed. I am tempted to throw Manifest Destiny into that fire pit too since in my mind I am loathing that game too because of its similarities to this piece of garbage.

A mai napot erre a játékra szántuk, tudtuk, hogy hosszú lesz. Fél 10-től fél 11-ig szabálymagyarázat, 11-től este 8-ig játék. Az 5 fős játék során kaptunk egymástól és magunktól hideget, meleget, voltak sikeresebb és sikertelenebb köreink.

Összességében ami tetszett: bár kockadobás dönt, ez befolyásolható és a még elviselhető kategóriába esett. Végre egy olyan startégiai, "európainemzetekbőrébebújó" harcos, gondolkodós játékot játszottunk, amin érződött a mechanika, a komolyság és az, hogy mi irányítunk. Jó érzés volt fejlődni, terjeszkedni, figyelni a többiek stratégiáját.
Ami viszont nem, az az, hogy aránytalan volt a játék. Egyrészt aki nagyon hamar előreugrott a fejlődésben, az óriási előnyökre tet szert. Aki viszont területfoglalásban volt otthon, az ellen összefogtak és szétszedték 1 kör alatt. A kártyahúzást befolyásolni nem lehetett, így a hozzánk kerülő lapok sokszor feleslegesek/rosszak voltak, ráadásul ha sok körön át nem kaptam a megfelelő néhány nyersanyagból vagy híres emberből kártyát, akkor nagy hátrányba kerültem.

Ha ennyi időt szánok egy játékra nagyon bosszantó, hogy ilyeneken múlik a játék végkimenetele.

Végül negyedik lettem és biztos vagyok benne, ha előrébb végzek jobban tetszett volna a játék. Ettől függetlenül érződik az amerikai jelleg. Ha nem lenne ilyen hosszú nagyon szívesen játszanék vele, de az általam érzett szerencsefaktor és kiegyensúlyozatlanság miatt 6-8 órát nem szívesen foglalkoznék vele ismét.

Sure, there are some interesting elements in this game, and I do like the theme. But when you add in all the bookkeeping, long playing time and ridiculously unbalanced cards and starting positions, this becomes way too luck-driven for a 5+ hour game. Can't really see myself playing this one again.

Avalon Hill.  This game is my favorite multiplayer Avalon Hill game of all time.  The mechanics are awesome.  The tech tree is well laid out.  The competition in markets (combat) is creative.  The card driven aspect of the game makes the game.  And the machinating of credits and use of specific leaders makes this game one of a kind.  Just a totally awesome game.  Best played with 5 players and a really good game with 6.  Age of Renaissance is in my top 30 games of all time.

Once we got the rules down, this was a lot of fun. I think we'll be slightly toning down one or two of the worst hose-another-player cards in future games - but not too much.

This is [b]not[/b] a wargame, however reminiscent it is of one. While maintaining dominance in a geographic region can give you a back-court which makes it harder for others to take certain things away from you on short notice, maintaining dominance in appropriate types of goods (by scattering yourself across the map) can earn you scads of money and win you the game. Which sounds like it's more worth the attention?

Would be rated a bit higher except for the amount of time it takes to play. (Playing just the first third is kinda unsatisfying.)

This is still the most expensive game I have ever bought.  $72 ($80 - 10%) at Dragon's Den in Grosvenor Park Mall during a summer sale.
It was designed as a sequel to Civilization and Advanced Civilization.  It succeeds at that.  It is also an Avalon Hill game, just like Civilization.  I had researched it and waited for it to come out.
The game board is actually too colourful, causing information overload.  3-6 players, with more of the map board being used with each additional player involved.  I have succeeded in getting 6 players together on several occasions.
The game always takes 6 hours to play.  Win or lose, I always enjoy playing - except on one occasion when I messed up right away and just dropped out of the game in the first hour.  I won't repeat that strategy in the future!

I have played this twice now. I really liked it the first time, but I liked it considerably less the second time. It reminded me of Risk, but with a technology tree, resource generation, and event cards. Unfortunately, there aren't as many paths to victory as I would like. There are certain technologies you have to get either the same turn as everyone else or one turn later; otherwise, you will lose. Timing those technologies is just part of the game, but I see it as constricting. Also, I'm rarely a fan of using dice to resolve combat.

RATING: 6
After one and a third games, I'd love to be able to rate this higher than a six, but nine hours' play to discover that my initial impression (that it's basically a chase to control the right resource at the right time) has left me disappointed. Not to mention that getting behind early seems to knock you out of the running for the remaining five hours of the game.
I'm sure I'd get a better idea of the strategic nuances if I played a few more times, but there doesn't seem to be enough excitement in the economics, 'combat' or negotiation (of which there is little required) to justify spending so much time on this game.

I really tried to like it, but this game didn't do it for my. Maybe because it;s the combination of "competing for markets" and getting bonusses when using the longbow. I will give this game another chance. Some day...

Okay, I gave it another chance. Still not impressed. Mechanisms are very smart - that's not the point. Somehow AoR just doesn't make me as enthousiastic as other games of it's type. It's hard for me to combine being a economic power with actual warfare, civ=building and leaders. Maybe I have to give it yet another chance. Maybe not...

Too long, but I did like advancing.  The wargame aspects were crap, so were the trading aspects.  Good thing England only got three crops of wool, ever, ever, ever, from 1250-1799, or so I recall.  A couple of cards are absolutely broken, and card counting is encouraged.  If I could take all the cool concepts, and remove at least 60% of the five hours of boring, boring gameplay, I still probably wouldn't play this game.

Tras mi primera partida a este juego que llevo persiguiendo tanto tiempo me he llevado una decepción importante. Es cierto que en el turno 3 estaba fuera de la partida, y esto es evidente que lastra mi sensación sobre el juego (4 horas viendo jugar a los demás me pasé). El problema que le veo, intentando ser aséptico, es la suerte. La experiencia cuenta casi tanto como la suerte, suerte con las cartas que te toquen, suerte con las cartas que jueguen los demás, suerte con los dados ... demasiada suerte para un juego de 5 horas.
Le voy a dar por lo menos otro par de oportunidades, porque es cierto que con esta desastrosa partida que jugué no puedo sacar conclusiones definitivas, pero la verdad es que esperaba una sensación tipo Civi de AH, y está lejos de acercarse siquiera a dicho juego ... Veremos.

I love playing this when I have the time.  I like the narrative arc that unfolds, where each player is out to seize territory at the beginning, scraping enough money together to buy an advance here and there.  Then the board is filled, and people are buying several advances a turn.  Then the fighting starts in earnest. 

Unless all of the players are familiar with the game and the cards, there can be a runaway leader.  There are cards to play against them to bring them back into the pack, but if the damage is done early in the game, it could be a foregone conclusion.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after 2 partial plays with 3 players. It's good. It simplifies [i]Civilization[/i] in some ways, tying resources to areas, which eliminates the trade element, and vastly reduces the "purchase paralysis" of [i]Advanced Civilization[/i] by simplifying the commodity and credit system.

With only two partial plays in, it's hard to say that poor luck in early battles or the Crusade card are really as critical as some people think they are. I get the distinct impression people are just giving up in Epoch 1 before really seeing how things play out in the long haul, especially with regards to the Misery Index.

On a side note, I think the addition of Area III is not only a nicer 3-player experience, it also mitigates an early Crusade card, and makes Genoa suck a lot less.

Update: After 3 real games at WBC with 5 or 6 players, I think the rating basically remains the same. It's definitely faster and more streamlined than Civ, and adds the concept of unrest which replaces direct calamaties. But, there's a LOT that hinges on the cards you draw, and Venice definitely has an advantage, while London can suck if you can't draw a Wool card. Anyway, it's decent but not great, and I think playing at WBC once a year is enough for me.

RATING: 3
SHORT SUMMARY:
------------------------
Age of Renaissance (AoR) is more or less a game of civilizaton building. Each player takes the role of a trading nation attempting to build a succesful trading empire. At least, that is what the rule book suggests. In  reality, AoR plays more like a wargame, which is okay in my book. 

Developing your nation is achieved by taking over regions and collecting matching sets of resources by doing so. The money you earn this way can be spend in your nations tech tree whose developments allow you to break some rules in a beneficial way.
Furthermore there are some history cards which you can purchase respectively get under certain circumstances. Some of the cards are quite powerful and can give the player who plays them a huge advantage. Actually, the cards reminded me a little of a CCG in that they sometimes combine very well and enable powerful combos.

The game ends once all history cards have been taken for the third time or one of the players manages to build all developments of their tech tree. The winner is the player with the most points.

COMMENTS:
----------------
- Playing this game made me realize how much I like and value the streamlined and sometimes abstract nature
of eurogames. While AoR seems to be a game with a lot of possible winning strategies, something i usually really
like, I'm not willing to play this game again. It is just to fiddly and long to keep my interest. Because of the many possibilties to develop your nation, the game drags on forever. Perhaps playing the game a few times more would speed thinks up, but I won't invest that much time into it. During the time it takes to finish one game of AoR I could easily play six or more games of Race for the Galaxy. A game that scratches the same itch for me but is far more reduced to the essential parts I enjoy in civilization building games.

- Since I haven't played this game nearly enough, take this with a grain of salt: I'm not sure, whether the cards are really balanced. I assume, a good draw in the beginning can give you a great advantage. This might be okay in a game that will be over in 60 minutes. But if this happens in a game that will continue for another three or four hours, I'm not willing to tolerate it.

- Downtime, a lot of it. The bad thing about this is, that you can't really use it to prepare your next move. Because of the rules of the game, the regions you control are never secure. So when it's your turn again, the board might have drastically changed. As a result, the downtime really kills the gaming experience for me.

- Lately I have realized that I don't like direct conflict in a game, if you can't protect yourself in some way against the attacks of other players. Take for instance Chess: There you can position yourself in a way so that some of your pieces are secure. Because of the ship rules in AoR no part of your empire is really secure and I guess, that is what the designer tried to achieve. I just realized, that this is not my cup of tea.

Oh man, I really want to like this.  The tech tree is really interesting, the abstract control resolution is really slick, but playing the game is just a drag.  I imagine I could come up with a smoother way to handle the money bookkeeping with a few more plays, but nothing can fix the fact that some of the special power cards are broken and stupid.  I'm looking at you, Crusades.  You too, War.  I'm thinking with a whole new deck, this would rule.  Make commodity cards list more than one thing, with a speciality in one maybe.  The leaders work, but the random misery stompers would just have to go.  Or maybe I'll find a better successor to Civ and not even need to bother.

My favorite game by far.  Sure it takes a long time to play and there is book keeping, but its one of the few games where I feel I have time to develop a long term strategy.  It also allows you to change gears as the game plays out, and thus you don't have to commit to one strategy and then if it starts to unravel you lose the game (which I feel happens alot in shorter Euro-Games).  Over the years our game group has played with tons of house rules since the game isn't perfectly balanced, so the game might only get a 9 rating if I actually played the original rules again.  [If you were to make 1 and only 1 modification to the rules, I would start everyone at 50 Misery, not 0].  I have played this game probably 100 times which is 50 to 75 more times than any other game (excluding quick card games, etc.) I have rated.

RATING: 4
Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh on this game, it's not actually too bad, I've only played it once, a 5 player game, we started at 8:00pm, & finished at 06:00am the next morning. By the end of it, a sore throat had degraded into full blown larangytis & a lost voice.  This represents the end of period where I was enamoured with Advanced Civilization and AoR was a pretty close match. I was willing to do these REALLY long games. However, as life has moved on, I find that both myself and possible competitors no longer have the time to do 4,5,6 or even 8 hour board games any more. I now prefer much lighter, shorter games, that can be played multiple times in an evening, as opposed to something like AoR that you may only be able to get the right people together to play maybe once a year.

I played Age of Renaissance a couple of times a long time ago. I have very fond memories playing Age of Renaissance. I haven't played it in a long time. I would want to play it again at some point.

Age of Renaissance takes a very long time to play. At the most, we played 2 era's out of 3 as I recall. It took mostly the whole day, and that was 5-6 player games. We always played 5-6 player games back than.

I would want to see the 3 era cards in action at least once to see how the game changes in the end. I always wondered about that and how it affects the game. There is probably some strong card in the 3rd era.

I heard there are some new games out there which are based on this game or are very similar to it. I would want to try them out and see the differences between the two games.

Age of Renaissance is fun to play about once every year or so. It takes a good willing players to play this game due to it's length.

I wanted to like this game more, as it was an attempt by the late AH to create an equally challenging game as Advanced Civ. without being as long as Adv. Civ. Well, this is also a LONG game (you still need a day to play the full campaign), and although the cardplay is very interactive, it (and the luck of the dice) make the game much less a feast for careful planners than one would expect. Luck plays a much bigger role than in Civilization. 
Full of clever little mechanics, but one gets the feeling that this is like a tuned little japanese motorbike instead of the graceful colossus that Civilization was/is.

Also, the combat was very bland.

Some aspects of this I really like - the on-board play is good, and the economic aspects, and it has a good flavor. But the randomness in the cards is a real killer.

RATING: 2
Oof, after spending an hour and 45 minutes listening to the rules explanation and then suffering through 6.5 hours before we decided to abandon the game (somewhere in Epoch 2), I feel punched in the gut. Why did I agree to play this one again? Oh right, because I used to love Civilization back in the day. Well "used to" is the key there because this old design clearly shows its age, and I can't see why people choose to play this when there are so many better games these days. Struggle of Empires, in particular, does the "tech tree wargame" so much better.

My main complaint with the game is that it ends up being extremely complex without a commensurate level of depth. I love me some complex games -- Through the Ages, Vinhos, and Brass to name a few -- but whereas the payoff for learning all those rules is a rich set of options that lead to delicious decisions, here the complexity far outpaces the depth. 

The asymmetrical start position inequalities baffle me due to the lack of mitigating factors, but then there are few catch-up mechanisms in the game. This is old school sink or swim, and if you sink early on, it's a long, slow death waiting for the game to end. Had we continued, it would've been 10+ hours. If the game repaid you in terms of interesting decisions, it would justify the time. As it is, I find it out of balance in a way that makes me uninterested in exploring it any further.

RATING: 8
This game seems very rinse-wash-repeat and you'd think that over the length you'd be bored, but that's not the case at all. The event deck and the sequence of each turn has tension and timing that is dramatic and engaging. The turn initiative has unique positive and negative attributes. The synergy of the tech tree takes a while to comprehend. A great game.

There's a lot to hate about this game, but I love everything about it. 

A true multiplayer strategy game that requires skill in many areas, most importantly - diplomacy, deal making, tactics, stamina and timing. There is luck, like any good game should have. In this game you must manage your unluckiness and properly plan to take the win at the right moment....or plow over your opponents before they have time to catch you. How greedy can you be before they pull you back? 

The best part? You don't need to play skillfully to enjoy it. I played many rounds loving just expanding, buying my techs and playing my cards.

Do not expect a new kind of AH Civilization as this game is completely different in all senses. Different but nice and interesting. As a 90's game it takes HOURS (minimun 4-5 with experienced players) and is full of tokens, rules and options.

But is a great game, with a fair system and a huge amount of strategical combinations.

A must have!

A long time since I played it but we played it quite a lot back then and I have very fond memories of it. Strong player interaction and desperate negociations at the table, the mechanics work very well, the initiative secret auction might look a bit gamey and lacking in theme but it adds so much tension and actually adds a lot to the experience. It's fascinating how, without variable player powers as such, your worldview and strategic options are completely different if you're say Genoa or Paris (I haven't played Civilization, or Diplomacy for that matter, but I guess you could say the same about these). Just hard to find 6 hours and 6 players nowadays.

Ok, I enjoy the game, it's not a bad Area Control game with technologies to develop. It also has event cards (that don't dissapoint me). So I have fun while playing, but cannot expect 5 or 6 hours to solve the winner through several dice throws, and that kills the game.

Suffers for the same game length problems as Civ. The resource scoring system is a nice twist on Civ's, however it does make planning difficult when you have no idea what resources are going to be scored, & when. Some advances are overly powerful, not allowing "natural" progression of the game.

Considerado por muchos de mi entorno como un clásico, lei las reglas y siendo como es un juego de 1996 no entiendo la longitud del juego, ni la cantidad de calculos que te obligan a realizar, sin contar que para que esté un poco igualado debes realizar unos ligeros cambios en las reglas y en el tablero, cuando se publicó ya era un juego demasiado pesado para ser de negociación, en 1996 ya estaba en el mercado Quo Vadis? y Los Colonos de Catan, si el juego hubiera salido a finales de los 80 sería un clásico sin lugar a dudas, pero actualmente hay juegos de Negociación mucho mejores y mas ligeros, aparte de que una copia puede costarte mas de 90€.
Lo mejor que puede hacerse con el si se encuentra una copia barata es venderlo y sacar beneficios, siempre y cuando no seas coleccionista.

Por cierto, lo vendí.

Empire building game slike this faces a serious problem. Since empires usually spend a lot of time fighting each other, they are prone to leader bashing and kingmaking.

AoR's solution to this problem is very satisfying: Changes in realative posission between the players takes some (but not to long) time, and it is a bit difficult to see who really is the leader (how many VPs will a difference in misery of 6 spaces be in the end?). Also, some information (cards in hand) is hidden. The players' problem is: To keep enough good cards in hand to be able to do well in the endgame, when also playing enough good card to not be so much behind that doing well in the endgame does not matter.

A good civilization building game, but it will probably be too long for many.  Learning curve may be steep at first, so expect 1-2 games just to get a good grasp of what you need to do (and when).  The Misery track can be quite problematic when you don't know which event(s) will send you plummeting down...

Combat system requires a dice roll, which some purists may not like, and even though I lost countless battles, it did not bother me (I prefer this to knowing in advance that my attack will be successful, as it removes some of the analysis-paralysis as players try to maximize everything).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Sold my copy some years ago, but recently played with 6.  Nearly any thematic game with a full complement is worth playing for me.  But my opinion was reinforced on why I sold it.  The game is too long due to constant calculating on what is needed for advances, only to be decided by the turn of a card.  In this case jumping a 4th place player to winner by drawing the same resource card in succession.  The game has some good ideas, but with too much baggage that has not aged well.  I'll insist we play HiS or VQ next time for a well designed period game.

[Inital impression: 4]
I've only played this once, and only through Epoch 2 - even that took us 7 hours (2 new and 2 experienced players), when we called the game due to time constraints (I won by a fair margin as Spain).  This would be a reasonably fun 2-3 hour game, but there is far too much randomness in both the card draws and the die rolls over battles for such a long and seemingly strategic civilization-building wargame.  Thematically, some of that randomness might work, but it drains the gameplay of its potential depth.  Some event cards are extremely powerful, especially in comparison to a large number of weak cards and considering that all cards are obtained by a blind draw.  You can plan out a complex series of moves for a turn (it is hard to plan more than 1-2 turns ahead due to the randomness of battles), and have that plan ruined due to unfortunate card plays or battle results.  Strategically, it seems that buying advancements (especially those you can obtain with a discount) is one of the most efficient ways to earn victory points, plus those advancements benefit you in future turns.  It is interesting how the game (through turn order benefits) rewards allocations of small numbers of armies to make incremental battle moves that are highly likely to be successful versus punishing a strategy of using larger allocations to make forceful moves that require a lot of risk to be successful. I could be convinced to play this again, although it certainly wouldn't be a priority for me.

RATING: 2
It's not a bad game.. it's just not my kinda game.
It feels very much like the old Civilization, except for the very simple dice combat. You expand, try to control the valuable ressources, make money, buy the right tech & thus win the game.
The one thing that annoys me about these "free-for-all" games (everyone vs. everyone) is that it comes down to a lot of whining about whom everyone should attack instead of attacking you.. and i REALLY don't enjoy that.
I like a games with a clear opposition or at least some hindrance in being able to attack anyone at will.. because whining and arguing is not my idea of having a good time.

A game similar to Mare Nostrum - trying to simplify Civilization in a shorter time. But the game loses a lot against Civilization: no trade between the players and the intertwining of the technologies with the rest of the game is less successful. Clever expansion mechanism, planning expansion points for the next round. Battles are associated with a high risk and want to be well thought-out, which is well implemented. In the end, the one with the most money wins, today it would be called victory points.

When I first played this several years ago, I thought this was a klutzy, complicated game that just took way too long (where we had to eventually stop in the middle of it). After playing this several more times over a period of two years (again, incomplete games), as of tonight, I finally "get it"! (Well, maybe sort of...) This is a very intricate and fascinating game, and a colorful revamping/re-theming of Civilization, although it too seems to have a very high learning curve and long playing time. Brilliant blind bid mechanism which determines turn order and combat strength. You must spend money to generate armies to make a land grab. Generate too many, and you go last, and your combat suffers. Generate too little, and you'll go first, get choice moves, win more battles, but you may not get as many cities or cards. More cities means more income. But spend too much, and you can't get improvements (civilization cards). The key is to pick up as many renaissance cards as possible, since they give you leaders (which give you discounts on improvements, which in turn give cumulative discounts for future improvements). Spread too quickly, and you're targeted for attack, either by armies or by dreaded event cards, such as famine, war, civil war, or the plague! If too timid, then your neighbors will walk all over you, and generate more income for themselves. It seems one must strike a balance between expansion and consolidation, all the while watching the misery track (which becomes a big deal in determining who wins). It seems that whomever has the most cities, isn't necessarily winning, as whoever has the least misery is better off for the endgame. The game is multi-faceted, with a wealth of options, and probably is as unforgiving as Power Grid is. The board and cards drip with theme, and the emphasis on getting "enlightened" is paramount. The only problem is that the game is atrociously slow with newcomers and veterans alike (since it takes a turn or two to understand the flow). Six hours is tough to come by (and we always seem to call the game within 3-4 hours due to extenuating circumstances), but definitely worth it. Initial rating: '8'.

Update (04/06/12) 1st play with own copy: Rules explanation took 1-1.5 hours. Play was helped immensely by player aids from BGG user Liumas and rewritten rules by Asperamanca, which incorporate some of the Euro rules (we agree with all of the changes, including map changes). Short game took 4.5 hours to get to 2nd turn of 2nd epoch, but we're confident that we can speed things along next time. Consensus was that this is a very good game, and definitely better than Civilization, due to the variety of options available and flexibility of play. There were comments that some event cards are broken or far too powerful, so we'll look into that. Although the mechanics are not too difficult, the way they interweave with each other is very sophisticated. This demands gut-wrenching decisions, resulting in harrowing excitement. It's brain-meltingly good!

Update (04/07/12) 3 plays: Finally played a complete game! A 4-player game took 9 hours. It took about 2 hours to reach the 2nd epoch (4 turns), 3 hours more to reach the 3rd epoch, and 4 hours to reach the end of the game (11 turns). For teaching AoR, it seems that there are three key areas that need to be clearly explained, for maximum enjoyment on first play: 1) Advances, and how they interrelate with each other; 2) Cards, and how they should be managed through stabilization; and 3) Board Expansion, especially competition. Everything else is ancillary. Everyone agrees that this is a great game. I am upping this to a '9', but this could be one of those epic '10's in my library, up there with TI3.

Update (05/12/12) 4 plays: 3-player complete game took about 6 hours. So, we're looking at about 2 to 2.25 hours per player for total playing time. We are coming to the conclusion that Black Death doesn't need to be "nerfed", but War! still does. Mechanically, this is a simple game, but the choices it presents is relatively complex. Play is intense. There is almost no downtime, as players are doing something in every phase of every turn.

Also, after playing only 3 and 4-player games, this game scales very well. We didn't miss Areas I/II/III. On a unrelated note, a player who usually enjoys Through the Ages commented that they are enjoying this a lot more, now that we've played it several times.

Well, okay, it's not like I played the whole thing.  There were several interesting features to it; I enjoyed the Parthenon-esque shortage/surplus thing and the way that you need to grab land to cash in cards and figure out when they'll help you.  But the offensive cards seemed really, really powerful, and it bothered me that there was no way to defend oneself against them.  And it seems likely that, had I played the last two ages, where the game seems likely to devolve into some kind of multiplayer wargame, this problem would only get bigger. (1 play)

Civilization derivative that starts off very interesting but loses its interest long before it ends.  An attempt to make the game feel more historical than Civ by adding historical leaders failed when many of the leaders were placed in the wrong epochs.  The two most interesting elements of the gameplay are the race to fill the map and using the aforementioned leaders to time tech advances.  After a while, the map fills up and there is a really stupid tech advance that negates the leader timing angst, resulting in a game without much going for it.  Don't even think about playing the third epoch.

Marketed as the sequal to Avalon Hill's Civilization, this game is set in medieval/renaissance Europe. I hated my playings of the game! I remember it as amazingly fiddly, very luck-based, and very unlike my beloved Advanced Civilization, which the ads had made it out to be.

Only one play, somewhat mixed feelings. This I would like to play again.

Edit: After another couple plays, there's more game here than I thought initially, but I'm not floored by it. There are several very swingy cards initially, and sometimes there's just nothing you can actually do when you draw junk.

What can I say, I'm a sucker for anything with tradable commodities.  As in Advanced Civ, need not to take calamities too seriously.  Plays better if you have a fast-moving group, as the luck factor in card draws can determine who wins, and can determine it by the midgame.  I'd rather the rest of the game from that point be two hours, not five.

There's a subtlety to game play, especially in the timing of certain cards, that I'm appreciating more as I gain more experience.  Also players need to understand certain game truisms in order to give themselves the best chance of winning.  I'm a firm believer that London-Paris-Hamburg should never attack each other in their home areas (apart from perhaps a little Hamburg-Paris sniping in the eastern reaches of Area III).  Every time I've seen two of the northern powers fight, a Mediterranean power has won, and the battlers finished far off the pace.  Also one needs to be willing to pay out others' commodities to get their own paid out in return.  Otherwise the game turns into a pure lottery, victory to whoever can draw the best cards.  Having the best access to valuable eastern spice and silk, the Mediterranean powers have a huge edge in a game with less negotiation.

Complex rules and very long game play.  My friends either love it or hate it for that reason.  Very nice graphics and lots of counters.  Unfortunatly we have found the rules vauge in several areas.  Seems like a great game if only we can figure it out.

Similar mechanics to Civilisation, but much tighter game.  How can you not love a game where increasing your religion increases your misery?  Still a large amount of recordkeeping, but a better game, if for no other reason than it is only 4.5 hours pergame, vs. 8 for Advanced Civ.

For what this game is trying to do, it plays way too long.  I like the game... and its game system, but it still feels a little hollow.  There are some 'official' errata available and are highly recommended.

A few house rules to shorten the play time and we'd have a '10.'

It is hard to believe that Age of Renaissance was first published one year after Settlers of Catan. While a whole new way of gaming was growing tremendous momentum in Europe, the premier maker of strategic games in the US, Avalon Hill, was quickly dying. After publishing Age of Renaissance in 1996, the finances of Monarch Publishing, the owner of Avalon Hill, went into a death spiral. After publishing just a couple more titles, most of Avalon Hill's assets were sold to Hasbro for a meager $6 million in 1998, and the 40-year-old company was gone.

Playing Age of Renaissance feels like playing a much older game. It is described as a "semi-sequel" to Civilization. While Age of Renaissance has some superficial similarities - European map, expansion, a tree of technology advancements that provide special advantages - AoR, which plays best with 5 or 6 and in about half the time of Civ, is a different beast entirely.

Both games are highly interactive, but in different ways. While Civ is essentially a trading game, AoR is an economic/war game cross-breed. AoR is highly confrontational. After all of the provinces are occupied, there is no option for growth other than attacking your neighbors. The war portion of the game is highly abstracted, with "influence tokens" acting as armies (or cultural infiltration, if you prefer). You need a set number of tokens to attempt a take-over, depending on the inherent strength of a province, which is printed on the board, and the roll of the dice significantly favors the attacker, with those going early in turn order having a MUCH greater chance of success. Borders are extremely fluid as a result, and the placement of strategic "satellite" provinces are needed to facilitate movement in different parts of the board.

The expansion fuels your country's economy, which is really what this game is about. There are two primary sources of revenue. One source is revenue from simple expansion. The more provinces you control, the higher your income. The second source is from controlling sets of the same goods (kind of like in Civ, but not really). Every province has a good associated with it. When a card is played that pays out for the good, those players get paid on a rapidly escalating scale depending on how many of those provinces they control. Some goods are quite spread out around the board. This encourages scattered and targeted expansion rather than simply growing your borders, making for a dynamic board on every turn.

In maybe the most brilliant aspect of the game, players purchase their expansion tokens secretly at the beginning of each turn, with those purchasing the fewest going earlier in turn order. There are advantages and disadvantages in any choice you make (more/less tokens, early/late turn order). Anticipating what your opponents' moves might be and weighing that against your own needs in deciding what token count and turn order you are going to shoot for is really at the heart of the game play.

The game plays out over 3 epochs, which are defined by 3 decks of cards that act as the game timer. Every turn you will draw at least one card, but there are opportunities to draw more and players should try to take advantage of them. Not only does it move the game faster, but the cards can also be powerful assets. They are used to control the timing of when certain goods pay out, provide discounts for civilization advances, and provide powerful events that can be played on yourself or your opponents. The events are essentially the "catch-up" mechanism. A common problem in civ games, and with economic snowball games, is that the more advances or economic advantages you have, the harder it is for players behind you to catch up. AoR resolves this by letting players target who the bad stuff is going to happen to, and players in the lead almost always become a target. Some events are so powerful as to stop you dead in your tracks for a turn or two. This is not a bad thing. In some cases, a cold stop is the only thing that could slow a leading player down. From what I saw, I thought the events served their purpose perfectly.

A great, epic "experience" game.

Static game in which success is fleeting and actual moments of triumph are few and far between, and usually beyond your control. A huge tech tree, but no real specialization, and a lot of crap to weigh down the meaningful abilities. Devastating cards that must be played against the leader. An accumulating endgame penalty that must be monitored carefully. 

There's a lot to like here and I've tried really hard to engage with it, but I'm not a good fit for this game, and I feel like I'm wasting other people's time when I play.

This review is based after only played through the first age.

Well first of all, it is a visual mess especially for a color blind person. There is a unique color for each of the resources (almost a dozen) plus a color for each player.

Second, you have a lot of technologies with special abilities that you must remember to know what is the most optimal thing to buy.

Finally, the game is very long to play, too almost 2 hours to play the first age, and the game takes more and more time as it progress. Forget the 3 hour delay on the box. It will probably be more around 6 hours.

THe game is long for what it is. The game I played, it fell flat rapidly. You expand, try to get territories that match the resources in your hand. Play the cards, get the extra income and then, there is nothing more to do.

Besides the resources types, there is no reason to attack a certain territory rather than another. That would have been OK if the resource were the core of the game, the problem is that it's not.

Resource get score in average twice per age. So what is the interest of considering resources if they do not get score that many often.

On my point of view, there is some potential for a great game in there, if the focus is changed, if some simplifications are done and if the game pace is accelerated to end in 2 hours or less.

An okay world domination game. I like the genre, and this one has a Euro feel, what with all the advantages that lead to other advantages, escalating to a win. I just don't see the "classic" status that some give Age of Renaissance. Seems a little clunky with the wild swings in luck. And with all of the truly great Risk variants out there, (I prefer Struggle of Empires or even Antike), I can't see playing this one again. But if the group insists...

I miss the game when it was out, unlike other products on the Avalon Hill's own product line.  Renaissance Italy.  Should have a good story against such backdrop at the stage.  The game is designed by Don Greenwood, the head driver at Avalon Hill at that time, emphasizing more on playability and fun of the game than historicity.  The later flourishing German-style easy economic/ conflict of civilization games could have traced the origin back to this game.

If I am going to spend 8 hours playing this sort of game, it will be Advanced Civilization. AoR fails in every respect to be great, or even better than AdvCiv, and a game like this should not ever be determined by die rolls. In the game I played, I was out of the running by round 2 - 45 minutes into a 8 hour game - because of 4 consecutive terrible die rolls. While it was plain bad luck - my combined odds for making one of them were well over 95% - the fact that it COULD happen in a game this long and this involved just makes it pointless to play.

As the game progresses, each player can interfere with whichever other player they choose.  The result is a game in which the overriding goal is to have other players attack each other.  That’s okay for me in a shorter game (such as Nuclear War), but this game is very long.  And figuring out who is really ahead takes a spreadsheet and/or a significant amount of time.  The result: Everyone protests that they’re behind, and that everyone is picking on them.  For hours.  Urgh...

My very favorite history/civilization/war game.  I like it *because* it is unpredictable and chaotic.  Even if you know all the cards and do great allocations, you can still get squashed by a nasty war, plague, or vicious string of battle dice.  It's gut-wrenching, but this is what makes it fun!

It has a lot of luck (dice AND cards).
Cards are greatly unbalanced.
The economic system is unreliable (if you get the right card you can get a lot of cash, otherwise...).
It's very long.
It's better with 6 players (each missing player makes some zones of the map "unaccessible", creating weird geography).
It's an elimination game (very bad for the first to be killed, especially considering the long playing time).

I've thought long and hard about my rating of this game.  It may be affected by the fact I had Civil War, that alchemy card and another nasty card all played on me the 1st phase and the only commodity cards I could get was stone and wool while two others seemed to be getting great draws... not to mention I was playing Genoa in a 4 player game.  I never could recover from those cards played on me the rest of the game.  We were playing it incorrectly however, we had forgotten about the fact you could buy a card with your tokens, the card to the person with the most number of conquests as well... so, it took A LOT longer than planned.  Anyway, I still rated it higher than what I felt like given it because it has so much potential and may play differently with more players.  Love the concept and idea!  Right up my alley!  Might be good for FFG to take this and redo it.  I think they'd kick glass with a reprint of it with their great artwork, design and a much more pleasing board to look at...  So, FFG?  :)

The topic is very appealing, the idea that you will be dealing with the whole factors of the age of renaissance is just wonderful. The board is very attractive but the rulebook is almost a nightmare: it is very long, with a lot and detailed rules so you have to be checking it out during all the game unless you have it mastered, but that is another story. I also own Puerto Rico and it also has a long rulebook but you do not need to be reading it throughout the game so it works well also with beginners. What I am mean is that this game is complicated. If you have to be checking the rules (and they are far too many!) all the time it is not fun at all. Another weak issue, at least for me, is that it takes too long and requires bookkeeping. So, if you mix the negative factors the fun diminishes. Shame because the theme and the appearance of the game is just sensational. I bought it 5 years ago and played it less than 5 times. Perhaps I need to play it again, but when I think about the complexities I rather pick up another game. Someday I will give it another chance and perhaps I'll re-score it... perhaps.

A civilization-building game with a 'tech-tree,' and some historical flavor if not always accuracy. One must constantly balance purchasing units to dominate more territories, purchasing advances, and keeping your population content. Has a unique combat system in which players who move early in the turn (player who purchased fewest units to place on the board moves first and so on) has a decided advantage in combat over players who bought more units, but move later. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because it requires a bit more bookkeeping than ideal and is long (c. 6 hours for the full game)

To begin with, the game revolves far too much around the "miseries" (Age of Church-Driven Misery would be a more apt title).  The pace of play grinds to a halt in the third epoch.  Playing time is just too long unless you are college students with plenty of free time on your hands.  Played it both for fun and competitively for several years and won't touch it again.

"Age of Renaissance" is essentially a re-working of "Civilization," but the changes do little to make the game faster or more interactive.  And some, frankly, just don't make much sense.  For example, trade goods are now tied to specific regions on the board (such as wool in Angora).  Which is good as far as it goes.  But because there's no mechanism to trade with other players, the only way to get a lot of one trade good is to engage in a war of conquest.  I'm no historian, but I don't know of any war that was ever fought to corner the market on wool.  Of course, the game argues that these "attacks" are not "wars," but rather efforts to increase "market penetration."  This is at least unconvincing and probably disingenuous.  And I'd rather not spend 6 hours imagining legions of highly-trained PR men engaging in a relentless media blitz on strategic targets in the Middle East ("We've achieved radio saturation, my Lord!").  Finally, it's this system that leads the game to its bizarre assertion that the "Cathedral" is the ultimate weapon.  What's worse, though, is that the civilization advances and the event cards seem significantly unbalanced.  All in all, however, "Age of Renaissance" is a decent effort to update "Civilization," with attractive components, well-executed chrome, but several missteps that lead to an overall diminishment of gameplay.

A good game trapped inside, screaming to get out.

The 2nd edition is less broken, but the problem from the limited games I have played remains in the cards, they're the biggest weakness in the game. The player that can churn through them in the fastest is always going to be sitting in the box seat.

Interestingly, my gaming group calls this a better version of Civilization because they hate the card trading phase of Civilization (which is to me, a highlight of the game), but the card churning of AoR makes it a far far worse game.

Quite a beautiful package, and easy to learn if you are already familiar with Civilization. The only downfall for this game and others like it, is the time it takes to complete.

Miss the trading aspect of Civ: more of a wargame feel.  Still, have played this one a lot and always have a good time, save when one may be well behind in the late game.  The 1 epoch game only good to get player's feet wet; 2 epoch can be done in ~4 hours.  Full game can run long.  Try to get someone to teach you who knows the game, because the rulebook is very hard to learn the game from, and even harder to look up a rule during play.

This one of my best games ever, although my last game was spoiled by the victor. It was a PBEM tournament, the Final Game. The winner made all of us uncomfortable with an uber-diplomacy indigestion, and finally reneged on his written pledge, by which it gave him the the win. I was glad it was over. I think nobody ever played again PBEM after that one, but I still enjoy the face to face.

There are surprisingly few rules for a game that is so deep and brain burning.  There are several things going on in this game, and a mistake early can kill you later.  Well worth the 1/2 hour to absorb the rules, and the 4-6 hour playtime.  Not for a casual gamer, though.

The only thing I don't like about this game is the luck factor -- it's quite possible to waste 10 tokens trying unsuccessfully to wipe out 1, or to have a vindictive fellow player nuke you with the Black Death twice. (Oh wait, I won that game...  maybe there was a reason I had the big target painted on my back.)

I bought this game when it first came out in 1996 as a "Renaissance" version of Civ.  On opening the box, things looked great.  New Years Eve, my wife and I grabbed a friend and began to play this game.  Much to our surprise, the game simply didn't seem to work; we couldn't understand the game well, the map for some reason gave us fits (despite the nice design), and the cards seemed broken.  I was sure I'd bought a turkey, and shelved it for a later play date.

Some months later, I discovered upon reading that the game was, indeed, broken:  the cards shipped in some early versions didn't have the right amount and type of cards.  After requesting and receiving a replacement set from AH, I was sure we'd be back to giving this game a try.

Alas, it still sits on my collection, waiting for it's true chance.  Everytime I bring the game up, my friends say "Isn't that the turkey that you tried to foist on us back in '96?"

After several plays, I have decided I don't like this game that much.  Basically it feels like it takes too much effort for the amount of fun you get out of it. I also don't like that you practically need to keep track of the cards that are played (even give you a sheet to do that).  In my personal opinion, I don't much like the graphics either, the colors are kind of garish and muddy, and the art on the cards isn't that great (they use a picture of Blackbeard for the pirates card too!).

Though I prefer the theme of AoR, give me Manifest Destiny anyday. Yes, MD simplifies things quite a bit, but that's the point - it gives you the flavor of AoR's gameplay in a reasonable 2-3 hour playing time... not the all day and all of the night test of will of AoR (at least with the max 6 players). My main gripe, as it is with many card-driven games, is that the unbelievably unbalanced cards and the bash the leader gameplay just gets annoying after devoting so much time to a game. You almost don't want to do well because you know that the next killer card is coming your way if you dare. Then, it just becomes a matter of who is the last man standing when all of the bad cards have finished wreaking their havoc.

I want to like this game more, but the randomness of the card draws is painful.  I once won a game by playing Enlightened Ruler, a card that made me immune to most negative cards... and then played three of those negative cards from my hand.  The other players lost so many points from Misery that I clinched the victory.  You could say that hanging onto cards until I got that particular combination was good play, but to me, it was just a stroke of luck.  Also, games can run very long, with lots and lots of bookkeeping.

Hard to play "socially" -- experienced players know the ins and outs of this game (such as optimal opening plays and card distributions) and will crush newbies.  Newbies, on the other hand, may take in-game conflicts too personally; I was once given the Black Death card for no valid reason, and was essentially removed from the game.  What fun.

I don't like this game anywhere near as much as others do.  I find the card mechanics tedious at times, particularly for the resources.  The randomness of that distribution seems to have greater impact on winning or losing than the decisions the players make.

That said, there are some interesting choices to make and some good strategy to pursue.  I just find the game less fun and more aggravating than similar games.  I'd play Advanced Civ over this, for example, so that there's less impact from the cards and mechanics that let you secure the resources you need.

This one's a bit of a mis-fire for me that needs a different way to handle the resources.

Age of Renaissance è un gioco davvero completo: bellissima ambientazione (con guerre, mercato, eventi, innovazioni, ecc.) con meccaniche innovative per un gioco da tavolo del secolo scorso: l'ordine di turno, la risoluzione dei combattimenti, il "tech tree", il funzionamento dei mercati. Inoltre, i giocatori non sembrano mai tagliati fuori dai giochi. Non ha particolari pecche, se non quelle dovute alla sua età: durata eccessiva, regole non troppo semplici da assorbire, fattore culo un po' determinante in situazioni delicate. Inoltre, alcune fazioni partono più avvantaggiate geograficamente. Un bella versione vintage di civilization: invidio chi l'ha giocato quando era uno studente e aveva molto più tempo libero di quanto ne abbia io adesso, che l'ho appena scoperto!

This game is somewhat like AH Civilization, but it eliminates a lot of the negotiation and lying, which is a plus for me.  However, the cards in this game are really game-changing, and you really have little control over which ones you get.  To have a chance of doing well at this game, you really have to know the cards inside and out so that you know what's coming and how to prepare for it.  So, it probably plays pretty well if you and your opponents are obsessed with it, but it does not shine in casual play.

Fun game. The game balance must come from the players and how the play the "negative cards". This is rather difficult, as it is hard to determine which players are in the lead.
Negative point: I dislike how this game ends. All players will have a lot of money to spend on discoveries, which, at that time, have become victory points, rather than nice special abilities. Somehow, this clashes with the earlier game, when people buy discoveries that help them with their strategies.

This was a very enjoyable game to play.  Played a five player game (Hamburg was left out).  Money is key to buying advances.  Advances are key to winning the game.  You win by scoring points for Advances (+), Cash (+) and Misery (-).  New players should not play London.  Barcelona or one of the other southern citi-states would be a better choice for a new player.  This is not a game for a pacifist.  At some point you need to create an army and just take positions.

I have only played this one once so take the 4 rating with a grain of salt.
My wife would give this a one tho. :)
We played this game over at Darius' house and Pasha bid too much for starting position.  Then she picked France.  She had lost the game in the first 3 minutes of play and then the game dragged on for more than 5 hours with her being walking dead.  (Not eliminated but not having any chance of winning.)  That one game has just about perminantly disuaded her from playing any of the games Darius and his friends play.   
Having said all that, my feelings are that it went on really, really long for the amount of fun I had.  After a 5 hour game we did not even finish it, there was still another epoch to play.  Also for a game that takes this long, the cards are too random and powerful.  One player in contention was knocked out of the game completely by the plague.  Lastly, there was a gang up on the leader thing happening at the end of the game which I consider a weakness in a game.  I played Hamburg which I think is a very weak position but I won't say that it is helpless with out playing the game a lot more (which hopefully will never happen).

I've only gotten to play this once, but it was a long long game and I think I really got the full measure of this game. In playing it once, I have now spent more time on this one game than the majority of the games I own (10 hour game, we did get finished).

I think, for being such an older game, that the look of the game has aged quite well. Components are cardboard tokens, but are all fine. The board comes in a few pieces, and looks great. It has paper money for currency, not a favorite of mine in a hidden information game - as people store it in pockets leading to notes getting crumpled, but that's a small complaint. 

I did try to read the rules. This is a major problem as they're not very clear at all. Luckily, we were being introduced to the game by Asperamanca from BGG. He has played the game multiple times and has actually written his own version of the rules (deservedly the top downloaded file for this game on bgg), so this was a huge plus for us going into the game. His friend Leo would also play, giving us 2 experienced players in the game which really helped the flow of the game.

The game is a civilization type game, with area control and learning of new "technologies". There is a bit of book keeping and mathematics involved, but I've no problem with a game being complex. Likewise, the playtime of the game is fine by me - I've no problem dedicating 8+ hours to a boardgame every now and again. The mechanics of the game are, suprisingly, simple. Turn order is very important, the first player gets a huge bonus to attacking - but will have a correspondingly low amount of tokens to use on attack! "Attacking" an opponent's territory mainly statistically favours the attacker, except later if someone wants to attack your "home" territory. We found that battles tended to avoid home areas, mainly being conducted in the neutral areas of the board around Africa and the East. Attacking is exciting, defending is nail biting. Playing later in the turn, you can always threaten someone who wants to attack you that you have a large amount of tokens and are "undecided" about who to attack..... The mind games and diplomacy can really be fun.

With all I've said so far, surely I should love the game?

Well, no actually. In between all of the great mechanics here is some very harsh mechanics. Events are randomly drawn, but planned play. Some cards are actually ridiculous. The biggest example is easily the "Black Death" card. This card can instantly make any player be completely out of the game. Seriously - it's that bad. It got played on myself and my girlfriend (shared territory, Genoa and Venice) in (what we knew would be) the last turn of the game. Our entire fully defended territory, fully built up and developed - every single territory reduced to a single population point of defense. My girlfriend got the same card earlier in the game, she had to play it (it costs currency to keep it in your hand indefinitely) so she played it in the East where it even hit her! She knew it was so harsh, that it was a horrible game ending card to play on anyone in their home area. If she had played it on someone properly early in the game - then that player would be so far behind that they would  have zero chance to win. They'd have the pleasure of playing for another 6+ hours as nothing but a kingmaker.

Some other cards can be just as bad. One player played "War" first turn and randomly picked someone else to go against. One lucky roll later and that player lost their capital. FIRST TURN! While I didn't realise it then - this was a crazy huge swing. Like any civilization builder, it's a snowball game. This put that player turns behind everyone else. When he was preparing to take back his capital, I happened to play "Papal Decree" and forbade the very tech he had saved for turns to get to allow him to take his capital back. Nearly an hour into the game and he's reduced to being practically a "nothing" nation. Kudos for him for coming back so well (and also not leaving in disgust), but looking back - it really was an unwinnable position he got put into early.

Diplomacy is mainly about persuading others not to attack you and to focus on someone else. When you increase techs, you have the option to really attack anyone (as you can attack any coastal territory, most of the board). At least in most civ builder games, you're limited to expansion near to your borders. So each player will not be facing off against all other opponents, only the nearest ones. Being able to attack every one else anywhere just invites dogpiles on the leader. Yes, this curtails the power of a runaway leader - but it also seems a bit arbitrary. I'm not sure if this is particularly good design or not, tbh.

The power of some of the cards is also an issue. Some cards are frighteningly powerful, as I have mentioned. The difference in drawing attack cards in the turns you want to attack is huge. You don't want to hold cards long (they cost a lot to hold, especially early turns), so you can often play them just to get rid of them. But when you go on the attack, the difference they make is so large. We house ruled the Crusade card, it could only be introduced after turn 2 as it was incredibly powerful too. For me, this card should be limited to the northern Europe nations - only going in on turn 3 or later. Venice/Genoa getting this would be very OP. As you can see - I think getting lucky with cards at the right time is a huge difference. 

Likewise, getting lucky with "your" commodity card coming out during a turn where there is a shortage - it makes and breaks the game. To put it in perspective, the difference between a commodity (that you own 2 of) being in surplus/shortage can be the difference between receiving 6 money (enough to buy nothing) to receiving 60 (enough to buy a whole technology). The difference is just too huge to be left to random chance like this - and I think the surplus/shortage mechanic should not give the increase/decrease in money received. As the beneficiary more often than most others - it meant I had a laughable amount of money at times. As the game went on, nothing was ever too expensive for me.

Overall - I think this is a good game and I'm glad I got to play it, but it has a few things in the game which are way too harsh and would need to be house ruled before I'd consider playing again. Namely:

1. Black Death - just removed.
2. War - Not included until turn 2 at the very earliest (maybe even all the way to Epoch 2)
3. Surplus/Shortage only give card benefit/money penalty. Do not give/remove resource value for calculating income.

Despite it's "luck" (Imbalanced Cards, Battle dice, unbalanced capitals) this game is my all time favorite. Starting with the game itself, everything looks just beautiful! Takes us about 4 hours to play (with a full pack of 6 players), so it can be done in one evening. Typically, players will play detrimental cards on the leader(s), keeping people in check. This mechanism makes sure that the original capital inbalance and the card drawing factor are not too strong.

You can call me anytime to play this game!!!

This game scales well with the board shrinking from the 6 player to 3 player game. The components have a high production value with no silly plastic pieces. Given the random appearance of personaltiy, event and commodity cards, there are no static paths to victory. Furthermore, the civilization advances give the players distinctly different strageties which may focus on aggression, commerce or exploration. One of the best.

I like this as a four-hour game; I'm not sure it would be any good at the 6  hours others have reported.  Luck of the card draw can really skew the game at times, but generally things will balance out enough for player interaction to fix.

--Dec2006-- I owned this for about three years.  I attempted to read the manual four times.  Each time, I gave up due to the proliferation of references to concepts which had not yet been seen.  I was happy to sell my copy.
--Mar2014-- And, yet...  I find myself wanting to give it another shot.  Weird, eh?  Reacquired.
--Apr2014-- Volatile, frustrating, amusing:  I'm not (yet) sure what to think of it.  Slings and arrows of outrageous fortune were certainly flung about; and they landed a bit indiscriminately.  I expect - like several games of its vintage - that one gets better at evaluating what's important as the play count increases:  so it's likely better than it seemed.  But there's definitely an "acquired taste" feeling.

I greatly prefer this to Civilization because that whole mad trading phase is done away with.. All the interlocking mechanisms mesh together very well with their advantages and disadvantages of doing this and that. There's a lot of ways to play it smart in this game. There's also a fair bit of luck in the cards, but we mostly make our luck. If you actively pursue trying to get as many cards as possible then you might find a good mix of cards coming your way. It's a fun little story played out in under six hours (if you play two epochs), and you'll be happy if you just go along for the ride and have some fun.

The best game ever
complex and very thin
offers various different strategies
at least 5 original rules in the gameplay system:
- rule of produce
- rule of turn order (tokens buying)
- rule of good fighting towards turn order
- subtile progress arborescence
- rule getting powerfull cards.

Very well balanced. As good for 3 players than for 5 or 6. And one of the only games where the loser cannot choose the winner in a 3-player-game.

The universe is one of the best (Renaissance) and it is well simulated.
The cards are esthetical.

Take Civilization, remove some of the best bits (no randomness, trading, civil war on a leading player that can help a trailing player) and replace the civ advance cards with a piece of paper and a pencil. Use dollars as currency to trash the theme. Throw in a horribly unbalanced deck of cards that requires house rules to partially rectify (fully removing the ludicrous advantage of being dealt certain cards over others is not possible with this game) and you have Age Of Renaissance,in my opinion one of the more overrated games on BGG. 

Start positions in a 6-player game are very unequal, unlike Civ where an attempt is made through other mechanics (like the AST and the flood calamity) to lessen the potential advantages of e.g. Egypt and Babylon.

This is a very good game in my opinion. You got aspects from Advanced Civilization but Age of Renaissance is different in key areas and therefore a nice variation. It is playable in less time than Adv Civ in our local gaming club. AoR takes us 6 hours for a full game and Adv Civ takes us about 8 hours. The 3 epoch carddeck with recycling cards works very well and the leaders add flavor. Recommended.

Considering how much I adore Civilization, this should really rate higher with me.  I find that it's just too long for me, given what the game has to offer.  By the end of the second era, I'm ready to be done.  This may seem a strange criticism since AoR is certainly shorter than Civ, but somehow the mechanisms in Civ hold my interest much better over the long haul.  AoR is by no means a bad game, just one that could do with a bit of streamlining (either of some of the systems, or of playtime).  I suppose I could just play to the end of Era 2, but leaving some cards permanently in the box just doesn't sit well with me.

One of the better huge multiplayer games from AH.  Lots of luck, lots going on...But very fun.  The big problem is how difficult the accounting gets late in the game (and to a certain extent, how hard it gets to track what other players are doing and if they're doing things correctly).  I understand that the recent rules modifications fixed a lot of advance imbalances and simplified much of the accounting, which would be welcome changes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game I played lasted 10 turns and took 10 hours to play. I'm not bothered with that so much as the fact that the game hinged for me on too much luck.

If it lasted 90 minutes or less, that wouldn't be a problem but to have too much be decided by luck in a long game is a big problem.

My issue was I lost two whole turns and money on attacking. On the first occasion I attacked 8 times for 1 success, when the odds where just slightly about 55% in my favour, and later having 3 attacks with the odds even more in my favour and losing every one.

I also suffered dreadfully in collateral damage twice, when I wasn't the intended victim but got caught in the effects of a vicious card - Black Death in this case.

I can accept being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but I can't accept losing 2 turns of a 10 turn game through no fault of my own.

What I enjoyed: combat system is painless and very straight forward, lots of tech advances give you lots of options. The card system lets you pull the leader back down to earth.
What I did not: Way too much bookkeeping. Too many money transactions for the paper money (gotta have a set of chips). The cards are too powerful. Any good strategy that lets you get out in front makes you the target of countless card attacks that remove your hard work. Overall, far too long for what we got.

Theres only 27 out of 36 Dark Brown Square pieces. (Not sure how this affects the game)

I have spent more time playing this game then any other game in my lifetime (excluding video games), even more than the many games of Uno I played as a kid.  There are many possibilities to consider, one of the most important is how to appear like you are not a threat to win the game, and then suddenly surprise others and win the game.  The game is very different with the different number of players which greatly adds to the replay value.  It might take a couple times of playing to understand everything, but once understood the game is phenomenal.

RATING: 9
Full of character.  One of the best examples of what old-school Avalon Hill could do to make evocative theme and engrossing gameplay.  This game is surprisingly good at simulating about a thousand years of economic competition.  The trading empires that were built historically tend to get roughly replicated, allowing for players to diverge strategically, but still focus on maintaining geographic cohesion in a manner true to history.  The race to the new markets is also incredibly well done.  It will happen organically as the game goes by, without it being something as generic as passing a year or turn threshold.

Though ties to [gameid=71] are stated right on the game's BGG description, it's very different in both scope and complexity.  Civ is long, simple, and heavily abstracted, but this beast is shorter, more complex, and has tons of bells and whistles.  There's luck here, but not so much that the incessant ganging up on the leader doesn't make much more difference.  Like Civ, the key to winning is focusing on getting advancements, and not getting too distracted by the game on the board.  I definitely suggest the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/943168/are-the-descartes-edition-rules-available-in-engli]Descartes rule changes[/url] for a more balanced and simplified game.

I love long and challenging games (e.g. Civilization), but this one is too much for me. Incredibly fiddly pieces, badly written rules and huge amounts of math and book-keeping in the later parts of the game took all fun out of the one game I played. 

Sold on Ebay.

I have open the game, but I have not played it.  It still has the pieces un-punched.

A bit heavy on the record keeping. You know you are are out of it long before it is over. Some cards are very unbalanced. At this point I'd rather play Manifest Destiny

I remember enjoying this game, but to be honest, I haven't played it since 1999 or so.

Played several times (with 4-6 players), quite a while ago. I have rather good memories of this game, although it was quite long and I am not sure I would appreciate it as much now.

One of my longtime favorite games.  It's not perfectly balanced and there is certainly a luck component, but I find it to be a lot of fun.  The main reason is that there is both a combat on the board component and a market component that work well together.  The playing time keeps this away from the table these days.

Great.  Haven't yet won a game, but still I enjoy it.  Can drag a little, though.  A buyer, if you like the period, or just want a decent day's gaming.

I'd give it 5 out of 5 in complexity -- the rules are a nightmare document full of exceptions and intricacies, some of which we miss out to keep things manageable; 3 out of 5 in the choice department, as dice feature very heavily, although players do get a fairly free hand in most other respects; and 5 out of 5 in conversation, what with players always fighting, cajoling and wheedling.

Now, what would happen if you played just Venice and Genoa on a fully open map...?

For me personally, another overplayed game thats popular with others in my gaming group.  It has the worse Kingmaking problems I've ever encountered (in the form of very strong calamities).  Also would be a better computer game with all its accounting.

I love civilization-building games, and this one has everything in it, and plays in less time than it's ancient brother.

I've only got 1 play out of this game, but it was a fine 11 hours of my life.  I would like to try for vengence some time.    

A player can be crushed by the draw in this game. That plus the long play-time resulted in me selling this one. As such, no vengence shall be had.

A game screaming to be excellent, but limited by minutae. This is the posterchild for a boardgame far better suited to being a computer game to help track the odds and ends. a typical AH game with tons of counters and rules rife with exceptions.

The way the varying game systems interrelate is ingenious.  One downside is a lot of bookkeeping and a lot of downtime.

Without the card imbalance it would probably be a 7. If the cards were balanced and I weren't so unspeakably horrible at it, it might be an 8. :)

RATING: 7
A good game.  Spain seems to be over-powering as a starting position, but it can be overcome.  Also, early Crusades can jump that player into the lead.  Too many times one or two players jump into the lead, with all or most of the other players falling so far behind that they can't compete.  I do like the Misery in this game, though!

But seriously, I like this game better than AdCiv. It's a little faster and a little more interesting.

This is my favorite game.  
I started playing this game in Austin with Marty and Jeff.  I was hooked almost immediately and went and bought a copy.  I would sit in my apartment and set up a mock game and play through a turn or two.
When I first started playing, I was constantly losing and falling prey to the numerous strategies, but this game bit me and would not let go.  I played it numerous times and finally started winning more than losing.
When I moved from Austin, Marty and Jeff gave me a "AoR week" and we played every night for a week.  I won every game.  I still thank them for that week as it was one of the best ever.
For me, this game has it all.  I like the mechanics of card play and strategy.  Although I don't really care for the dice rolling aspect in games, I like how it influences game play in AoR.  I also like the subtle use of the backstab; it isn't overt, but can be used to great effect.
Overall, I could play this game anytime, anywhere.
Without a single doubt in my mind I would say, "No matter how you do it, get a copy of this game!"  Unless, of course, you are like the user Kwebec and stole this game from me in a trade.  I will honestly suggest that you do not go to these lengths to get a copy of the game.

A really good Civilization hybrid game concepts are a little abstract but workable.  Played this many times in the past and hope to again soon.

Every time I play this, I become more convinced that who wins is purely a function of drawing the right cards.  If you draw attack-type cards, you're going to lose.  If you draw leaders and commodity cards, you have a shot if you play properly.

Beautiful game, and interesting. Main flaws are frequent bookkeeping and length of play time, not to mention level of complexity.

Took some 7 hours for a full campaign with a 3 noobs and one who had played the game some years back. At the end victory was handed to me by a tired player... victory by stamina, if not by wits :)

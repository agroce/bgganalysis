GAME: Victory:  The Blocks of War
RANK: 3747
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a block game version of [thing=1574][/thing].  Having such a variety of units is the strength of the game, as well as sharing many of the rules from [thing=912][/thing], but Pac Victory was a more perfected version of this game.

Some of it seemed a bit gamey and the initiative portion seemed a bit unbalancing.  Overall a fine game and with some house rules, it could probably achieve a strong 8 rating.  The expansions may even push it up to a 9.

The beauty of this game is the possibilities of house rules and the endless options of battles. Either historic or fictional. No rating since without house rules it is a 6 with them a 9 or higher

RATING: 9
Rating for adjusted version.  Out of the box it is probably a &#039;6&#039;, especially with the awful suggested scenario that plays like WWI.

As others state, this is a kit.  The mechanisms are solid. Needed some creative adjustment in terms of scenarios and the resource model.

However, with various adjustments Victory becomes many very good games (as would be expected from a kit with good mechanisms).

Not a 10 due to requirement that this game must be played vs. players you are confident know the rules well (and you trust).  The benefit of fog-of-war also removes auditability of opponent&#039;s actions.

Update: I've come to conclude Victory is at its best as a 2- or 3-player game. Games with more players drag too much. Scenarios are a must. 'Pick armies and fight' doesn't work well. Yeah, it's a kit. But when you're playing a good scenario, it's SUPER fun.

The modular aspect and the ability to mix/match rules and units is great.  I don't mind that it's a "kit" and you have to experiment with optional rules and scenarios.  That's part of the fun.

One thing that makes this better than its more recent cousin Wizard Kings is that the units all cost the same.  It makes establishing your forces in the beginning of the game much easier.  One of the things I always disliked about WZK is the need to spend a bunch of time building up your army and counting your spent gold to ensure you don't go over your allotment; it sucks the fun out of the game for me because it takes so long before you're actually PLAYING.

RATING: 5
A decent underlying system, but the game desperately needs a broader variety of scenarios. Nice, light, short wargame, but without more scenarios (and most of the ones on the net are not great and suffer from the same problems as the basic one), doesn't reach its real potential. Some 8 block colors are available, but more than 3 or 4 are unnecessary.

I think I like this one more than Wizard Kings. It seems to flow really well. I haven't come up with a good use for the aircraft carriers just yet. Maybe it was just how te map and scenario fell in the first game. Looking forward to more games of this one. 1 Play

Another of my favorites. Again, I like the abstracted quality -- it's not really World War II: It just feels like it. I'm a big fan of the block system, with the fog of war and step reduction built right in.

O.K. I agree that this system is a Front Games system light.  This to me is one of the few games that I feel are good for introducing people to the Block Systems, as well as War-games in general!  To me it is one of those rare systems that allows an experienced player to play some one who is just starting out in War/Board gaming and still have as much fun and challenge as if they are playing some who is closer to his level of play

Falls somewhere in the void between Axis & Allies and Napoleon, and fails at both.  The unit differences are negligible and the stacking/hexside limits keep the game stagnant and predictable.  Where's the fog of war when you always know for sure that a city has 4 ground units, 2 air units, and 2 naval units?  Haven't tried the expansion units nor any house rules yet - maybe they can salvage this game.

My favorite house rules:

5.55  Any unit retreating out of a battle hex is marked with a coin and cannot move (or respond) until the coin is removed.  A player removes all coins from his units at the completion of his Attacker Movement phase.

When using the "elite" unit sets, the submarine may only be targeted by destroyers and aircraft.

Great fun for those of us more interested in gameplay and scenario design than historical reenactment.  The maps are fictional, but the units are WW2 technology.  This system precedes the A-B-C order of fire seen later in Wizard Kings and Hammer of the Scots.  The game has a lot of rough edges, but the basic system does a good job of demonstrating the need for air and naval superiority.

A good idea game.
Defender player is advantaged, no one attack and the game become bored.

Mega multiplayer scenarios (6 maps and up 6 players) is beautiful.

RATING: 7
An inventive little game from Columbia. Really more of a gaming kit, which is strange since it would have worked well even with alternative World War II nations, such as monarchies that survived the First World War. What I do wonder is why this was not converted to World War II in Europe? Maybe they are afraid of the competition it would have with the bloated EuroFront series? If so that seems to have faded away. Ron Draker is expected to design a new game design on the subject. Will it be in the Victory tradition? I do hope so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Really more of a game kit than a game. Out of the box, I find the game lacking, but agonizingly close to something I'd like. Attractive components have spawned dozens of suggestions about how to improve the game -- everything from focused scenario design to fundamental changes in unit values and sequence of play (I've published a few myself, via Gary Graber's wonderful Panzerschreck magazine). Clearly, there is enough to like about Victory that devotees such as myself continue to return to it, but I'm not convinced anyone has got it perfectly dialed in just yet ... at least, not so perfectly that this game will elbow ahead of other Columbia efforts (like EastFront or Hammer of the Scots) when deciding what to play next. Of the many variants/suggestions on the web, Jim Mason's ideas (SIMPLE house rules link from the Related Links section) worked the best for me -- his hexside limitations for attacks was a particularly brilliant idea. My own plan is to go up one level to grand strategic and see if I can use Victory blocks on the map for Axis & Allies: Europe ...

RATING: 3
Not as good as other Columbia block games.  Played once, game lasted for two and a half hours and ended in a draw.  The game stagnated, with each side reluctant to attack cities due to advantage that defender has.  And because of stacking limits, its not possible to get a larger force to attack the defender, if the defender just piles units into a city.  Don't like the lack of scenarios that come with the game out of the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a generic wargame in a WWII setting.  Scale is closer to Strategic than it is to Tactical.  Due to this it may appear to be bland to some players, but it is most excellent for those who like Strategic scale type games.

The block system is quite ingenious and offers very good fog-of-war, not to mention there is no need to record anything as it is all done using the blocks (and rotating them to record hits/damage).

Each unit is rated for Air, Land, Sea (combat) and Movement, which results in units having different specialties.  In turn, this provides the units with certain advantages and disadvantages.

Combat system is also interesting; it is an advanced version of what is seen in Axis & Allies, with priority given to faster units, the defender always firing first when both players have the same type of units present.

Combat system rewards combined arms approach, and requires multiple waves to break through a well-defended area.  If your attack is not well planned and supported, it will most likely fail, especially if the dice Gods are not on your side.  Advantage goes to the low rollers  ;-)

Recommend getting the ELITE expansion, which adds more units.  The map expansions are also good to have.

Down side:
The game can bog down with multiple players as there is not much interaction except for the "Air Response" phase during which the defender can move air units (and Mech units with the ELITE expansion) to an area under attack.

Expect a lot of die rolling.

The entire game system can be rather costly.

Lastly, all units cost the same.  Making a house rule to alleviate this is relatively straightforward.

With the latest rules, the 'Elite' units, and extra maps, there is a lot to keep lighter war gamers coming back. I agree with the other comments that the game is a bit generic, but I don't think that it makes the game any less fun. The stalemate issue is easily remedied with the house rules posted here. Since most of Columbia’s 'Block' games are 2 player, I think that this is a excellent addition as it easily accommodates several people.

A great game for generic WWII era.  The battle system is very innovative where battles can be either routs or bloodbaths depending on the unit composition in battles.  There is a lot of bluff and maneuver.  Although both sides are equal, limited force pools force decisions as to where to deploy your crucial armor, dive bombers and fighters.  The elite bloc set is a great addition too.

A generic block war game based on WWII era technology with geo-morphic maps.

This game is fun, but is more of a game system than anything. User created scenarios are a must in order to prevent the game becoming a symmetrical war of attrition. It seems larger playing areas with fewer forces would prevent this.

I traded for this because I wanted a light, multiplayer (2+ players) wargame, that offered some depth, but wasn't necassarily historical or featured few scenarios. For that purpose, this game works fine and is fun. 

If you're looking for a more solid block wargame you should probably look elswhere. I'd still like to pick up Europe Engulfed.

I basically own near everything Columbia games released for this game systems (all 16 maps + the blanks, 6 different base armies, 4 elite army sets and the logistics expansions).

This does work really well for 3+ players too. My group played with four on numerous occasions (doing two teams of two players, each with his own colored blocks) and it was good times.

Couple of plays only so far.  Planning ahead is important, and the relatively small number of units and small maps allow you to do so without feeling overwhelmed.  This is a big war in a small package with a high fun factor and nicely done components. {Edit: Holding up nicely with more play.  I really like this title.  It is one of those games I think about at odd times during the workday... maybe more army and less navy would have helped me hold my territory last game!]

A bit static the one time I played.

Attrition based WW2 themed combat.  Hard to make headway against a defender (logistics are hard on the attacker).  Air units, due to movement range, seem much better than other units (can't kill a unit, but can reduce them to a single step).

Basic build your own scenario really not that exciting.  Better scenarios?

While I like Wizard Kings better (fantasy nut), this is an excellent kit system, especially with added maps and elite unit expansions.  If you like games with a ridiculous amount of replayability - here you go.

The only thing I found to be missing were markers for "out of supply".

Also please note the sequence of play differs slightly regarding supply check for a 2 player game vs. a multiplayer game (the multiplayer game includes an additional supply check after production as per the SoP on the back of the rulebook).

RATING: 8.5
Play once as a two player game.

An excellent dice-baced combat game.  Units are represented as one-sided blocks, placed on the map so that their player can see them, but the opponent can't see what type they are (a'la Stratego).  Units have defined movement and attacks, and when two players' units end up in the same space, a battle happens.  

One thing that sets this game apart is how easy battles are: there are no combat modifers at all, and resolving fights is as easy as going down the order of battle and rolling the number of dice each unit gets.  As units are wounded, their cube is rotated to show the damage, which is also how many dice they roll.  Hits are easy to determine (a set number on a d6).  Air power also has the ability to respond to a fight even for the defender, allowing some measure of reaction when it's not your turn.

Our first game of this took a few hours, thanks to having to figure out the rules, but future games should speed up.

The game looks like it should be easily replayable, and great tactically.  Very good!

Not as good as Wizard Kings, but different enough I don't regret buying it.

RATING: 9
Although many gamers have commented that this is more of a game kit than a finished game, I really enjoy "Victory: The Blocks of War": over time I've raised my rating, up to 9 for its potential for creating battles and because the more I play it the more I like it and vice versa. 

However, it seems to me that one's enjoyment of this game is going to center on whether one expects to get a war game simulation with set scenarios, or whether they are going to be okay with a game that seems more like a kit that allows them to try out a virtually inexhaustible amount of scenarios which they can create themselves. That's what, I believe, people mean when they comment that this is more of a 'kit' than a game. 

If it's the 'kit' that appeals to you, then picking up the extra maps, the elite block units, and the Logistics set are highly recommended. I find it very fun to play and am not put off by its "ahistorical" nature (although it's not based on specific geography or nations, the units represent WW2 technology). I like the system, as it's not difficult to understand, it plays fast, and the battles are furious but not always decisive (a good thing). 

As suggested by other Geeksters, I've picked up extra sets of blocks, elite units, maps, and Logistics Rules, all of which add to complexity and a more satisfying gaming experience. 

I understand why some players don't find this their cup of tea due to its ahistorical nature, and given the cost of accumulating all the maps and blocks for this game (anything but cheap), there aren't that many scenarios available (either with the game or through the Columbia website), but as others point out, this is part game, part game-kit. 

Personally, I can use my imagination to fight it out among fictional opponents, and there are many scenarios that gamers have created and published, many of which can be found on the Columbia Games website. 

Another area of discussion about the game is whether it is overly slanted toward defense, with the complaint that battles bog down into WW1-like trench warfare, in which attacking becomes less than advisable. This can be true; however, using more than 2 maps at a time is definitely more interesting, as it spreads out units and forces more tactical and strategic choices, and tends to lessen the built-in advantage to defenders. I've also taken to unbalancing forces somewhat by rolling 4 or 5 dice 10 times for each side and taking the average as the respective starting number of units. After all, in any given war, how often are forces evenly balanced, and, if you start with absolutely equal forces, does it not make sense that there would be a tendency toward stalemate? In my opinion, starting a game with somewhat unbalanced forces still provides parameters in which a player with superior tactics and production and battle dice rolls can achieve victory.

The more I think about this game, the more I tend to believe that it's a solid design, and its only limitations are one's imagination, so on that count I like it a lot. Also, I find that playing this generic block game helps to learn more specific, historical block games quicker.

Note: Maps 1-4 come with the game. In addition to the base game, I also have acquired extra Maps 5-16 and the blank map as well as the much-recommended "Logistics Set" and Elite Blocks sets Red, Blue Green, and Gray--which add different types of units, such as elite armor, jets, and various types of naval and air units not included in the base set.

RATING: 7
My rating for this game might go up with time, but as of right now I have two main concerns that keep it from being an 8.  Firstly it seems that a 2-player game does more of emulate WWI attrition than WWII-style mobile engagements.  Secondly it feels like defenders have an excessive advantage.  With all that, though, the block system is still one of the best and most elegant ways I've seen of keeping track of the game state.

Could have been better...but as it is this is probably the best "blue vs. red" generic wargame kit ever made.  

Edit/Update 2009:  Still a fine game or gamekit, but it doesn't work as well as Wizard Kings.  You really need to know the game before creating a scenario otherwise you can enter some serious molasses unfun situations.  Rating revised downward but there is still hope.

RATING: 8.5
Was rated a 7, now up to an 8.5

Several games on and I can see far more depth and strategy to this game than before - it's not just a construction kit.

Some map layouts can result in the stalemate situations mentioned by others  but I find the inexpensive and rapid build phase means that within 3 turns the players can be pushing past the front lines with completely different units and turning their positions around with marines, airbourne or more...

At least, this has been my experience and it's been thoroughly enjoyable so far

I would argue with comments that this 'WW2' game plays more like a WW1 game. At times I feel that by sticking WW2 units on the blocks and claiming that they represent whole Corps or Wings, that players expect more historical flavour. Also the huge map scales too don't help this.

If only Columbia had issued a more generic block set with Nato symbols and didn't mention hex map scales then this game could potentially have been marketed as pretty much any conflict of the early to mid 20th century and the criticism wouldn't have been so strong.

If you look past the art I reckon most can envision jet fighters and tanks fighting in Korea or by removing or altering certain units, players can refight conflicts in the Balkans or the middle east.

With Victory almost anything is possible with a few little tweaks

Not the biggest fan of this one.  It's a general problem I have with lack of context in a wargame.  Everything ends up being a meeting engagement.  You really have to have well crafted scenarios for this sort of game, and it seemed like that was lacking.  Nor did it seem worth searching out the scenarios.  I'll play EastFront instead.

A generic WWII operational system is a strange concept, but I liked it from the pre-publication version I played a Origins. A clean system that you can easily add your own chrome to. The downside is that you kind of have to.

Clever & reasonably simple system of generic WW2 unit types.

There are various ways to avoid its reputed deadlocks, e.g. start with few units on a large map, use the optional 2-point cost to build a new unit, use pre-designed scenarios findable in the web, etc.

I created [[Victory FAQ]].

Played once so far, the only problem was that the game was very heavily....balanced!!! Our game ended with a stalemate and at first sight it seems that the problem is the unit density. If one makes a home scenario with same units on a bigger map or less units on the same map it seems that the game will roll much better. I am working now in order to create asymmetric scenarios of my own.

I love this game system; it has all the things that made WWII a great game platform: planes, ships, tanks, artillery, infantry!  Fog of war, step reduction, cadre-building and reinforcement, geomorphic maps.  What's not to like?  If only there were some solid scenarios, it would be a 10 , but I still love it!

It just oozes wargame cool.

A "philanthropy" purchase from a game store that deserved some of my money.  We'll see how it pans out.

Update:

Like everyone else, I'm trying to brainstorm variants that make the base game playable.  So far this seems to be a decent combination:

*Use 4 maps for two players; 30 starting units per player.

*Play a fixed number of turns (8-10).

*Both optional building rules are in effect (2PP for the first step of a new unit; only one step can be built the turn a new unit enters play).

*Only VP cities on the [i]opponent's[/i] side of the board are counted for victory.

*Once a 2 or 3 VP city has been taken on the opponent's side of the board, it still gives 1 VP at game's end even if recaptured (representing a permanent morale hit).

*The total number of enemy blocks killed on the [i]opponent's[/i] side of the board (only) are also worth VP, with 5 blocks = 1 VP (rounded down).  Though this conversion rate may need tweaking.

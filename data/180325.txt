When explaining games to the 90s kids, you can ask them to relate to pokemon. I also like this over TTR vanilla.

Will play Elfensea some other time.

The feel of TtR but condensed.  Players need to parse the board state and read their opponents plans from the tiles they draw.  Doing it right (or getting lucky) lets you accomplish a lot more (or at least a little bit).  Parsing it wrong can leave you barely able to make any progress.  

There's definitely luck in the cards you draw and the tiles available, but that feels ok given the 3 rounds and the overall game length.  I've only played Elfenlands and while I'd like to play Elfensea, I'm not sure about Elfenroads.  It sounds like it ups the complexity (and time) in a game that works better as is... but that's an ignorant assessment as I have yet to try Elfenroad.

RATING: N/A
The graphic design was difficult for my old eyes to see -- tiny drawings on a small reference card needed to be referred to a lot, and the board did not make some of the available routes clear enough for me. In addition, the obstruction tiles in the one play I participated in all came out in the last round, turning a friendly game into a spiteful one.

RATING: 6
Simple logistics game where you're trying to visit as many cities as you can. Has some interesting mechanics for movement, and lots of variants. Gameplay is straightforward but you can see there is some depth there, unfortunately the design feels dated, and there are other games that give me a similar feel that I prefer.

Plan your road around the map. Hope you draw some good cards and that your adversaries lay down the right vehicles on the roads you want to use. Run around the map and try to pick up 20 blocks in 4 turns.

Classic game, back in a new edition that includes Elfenland, Elfenroads and the new Elfensee.  Docked a point or two for the terrible art decisions, particularly on the travel counters.  They blend into the background art, which is a shame.  They need to "pop" off the map, and be clearly visible to the table, and are missing the bright vibrant background colours of the earlier games.  Reminds me of the Orongo art screw up 12 months ago.  Seek an Amigo 1998 edition - I'll use my bits from that on the Elfensee map.   If you can get past that, the Elfensea board is interesting - 32 towns to visit (up from 20) but no discarding of tiles or cards, so you can hoard for huge turns.  The transport counters that you can collect from remote cities, that you can use in 3 ways, gives you some more options.

Finally an English edition that contains Elfenland, Elfengold and Elfensea. For the longest time Elfengold was a tough to get and it was never released in English. This is sort of a 'Big Box' version of all things Elfenish. The only negative someone might have is that they used new artwork for this game, which I am fine with. I do miss the old graphics and the iconography on the old cards were much easier to read. So you do sacrifice a little in that regard. On the whole though, it's nice to see this return.

Elfenland was the 2nd Eurogame I bought back in the 90's. It solidified my love for Eurogames. It has a simple, well balanced design that keeps us coming back to it. Now, with this new edition, Elfengold has been added to the box, an expansion I wanted for a long time but could not afford because it was OOP. With a new, reversible board and additional way to play, I love this game even more!

It really is the clunkier ticket to ride. But the theme resonates with kids.

RATING: 8
I already like Elfenland, and this game includes that game plus even more. I think it has some merits over Ticket to Ride, but the drawback has always been having to play on the same old map. Including a new map and rules (Elfensea) along with an expansion (which I have not played) really gives this great game the treatment it deserves. The artwork is good. Much more fantasy than cartoon this time around. I like both styles, but I imagine some people will have a strong preference for one or the other.

I like the map for elfensea but the additional rules with the tokens make the game less strategic. Art is pretty but less functional than the previous edition, makes itharder to plan routes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elfensea adds tokens that are gained by visiting the cities in the corners of the map. It is either look at 4, keep 2 or look at 2, keep 1 depending on the city. These tokens can be exchanged for the top card of the deck, used as a regular token on the map for traveling, or at end game, grants a extra 2 points to majority (1 point for second) for each symbol.

Interesting idea, but rarely did throwing the token away for a card seemed to help anyone (lots of groaning after people got their card) and while the end game scoring added some flavor, felt like a total crapshoot as you didn't know what people were collecting. If I ever play this again, I think I'd try playing with each player's tokens face-up so you can judge whether you think it is worth going for a particular majority or junking the token.

Not a better or worse game overall, just a different flavor of Elfenland.

RATING: 7
A route-planning game with a high degree of both chaos and randomness.  It's one of those games where you need to stay with other players, because otherwise what you can do is very limited...but on the other hand, they're unlikely to do what you want.  I'm not a huge fan of trying to predict which way I'll be able to go based on other people's decisions, but then again, when you can make cool things happen...it's pretty cool. Much prefer to play with "home cities" variant. Haven't tried Elfengold or Elfensea.

Good excercise for kids to learn how to plan your route through the landscape and to pickup the cubes of your colour. I'd say not bad as a kids game, although nothing special either. My son didn't like it.

RATING: 9
An absolute classic in a new edition. Having played the original (Elfenroads) and the later Elfenland/gold, and also having played the "real" prototypes for TtR (Santa Fe, Santa Fe Rails, Clippers), I have to say the comparisons between this and TtR don't stack up. This is a different lineage of game entirely, but the comparisons follow I suppose because they have the same designer. What I like is the route-planning/travelling aspect, which you don't get with many games. There's also a little less luck than TtR, and more anticipation of your opponents' plans needed. I may well have a look to see if there's some mileage in introducing the Elfengold aspect to the Elfensea map.

Elfenland and Elfensea are both great. Haven't convinced anyone to play Elfengold with me yet, although I expect it will play better with fewer players because if the extra playtime. Overall great.

In a sense a prototype for Ticket to Ride, but really a fully realized game in its own right that rewards strategic planning and piggybacking off of other players' efforts in a manner that TTR does not. The game is simple in concept, yet surprisingly thought-provoking in play as players struggle to optimize a random assortment of tiles and cards into something that resembles a plan. The so-called variant, in which players need to end the game next to a destination city, is all but essential.

Alan Moon has a knack for creating really tense game play. I am always on the edge of my seat, hoping to god that my opponent won't build that certain route in Ticket to Ride, that the second identical disaster won't show up in Diamant, or like tonight, that my vindictive wife and her sinister sisters won't place their hinder in my way. Well, they did... but that doesn't affect my deep appreciation for the game, only for certain family members!

RATING: 6
Elfenland is one of the better family games that I happily also play with hardcore gamers. I already owned the base game and the Elfengolds-expansion. The latter ain't a good expansion imho as the gaming time increases exponentially and it can take more then 2 hours which is simply too much for this game.

So when this jubilee-edition came out, I had some hesitations, as I already owned 2/3 of what's in the box, but then again an other map and a new way of transportation on the map (the whale) made my buy a copy anyway. A BIG MISTAKE. 

First, you get a big box which takes a lot of space and it consists out of 2/3 of air. Why there are so many trays in the box is a riddle, as you don't have that many components. Second, in the previous version you have nice cylinders as city marker, here there replaced by cubes which have different shapes (= not the best quality). And third they fucked-up the artwork: the forest is in a sort of yellowish tint which make it hard to distinguish from the desert from certain angels of view. 
So the new map, was it worth? For me not. The thing with the bonus tile you get is a bit of a crapshoot and it again prolongs gaming time as you have to interrupt your journey to look at them and chose them. And the new transportation mode, the whale, can be quite frustrating if you don't get them as 1/3 of the cities is in the sea. 

So if you were like me and already have the previous version of Elfenland and are doubtful about buying this new edition, my advice would be: don't spent your money on it, as the quality is less and the expansions aren't worth it!

tl;dr: familiar

I had played [thing=10][/thing] once about 10 years ago, so I didn't remember much when this hit the table. 
So the main mechanism in this game is that first players decide what routes have what requirements from travelling and then they play cards to actually travel those routes, placing markers along the way, and the goal is to have the most markers.
The system works very well and is both simple and enjoyable. It's not groundbreaking, though it might have been when it first came to market. Today it feels friendly and familiar. Nice

Nice light family game. I play it with friends that don't play games often. Can't wait to play it with my son (he is not old enough now). Not much player interaction.

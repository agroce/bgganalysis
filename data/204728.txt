Very good expansion to the BattleCON roster. The rules changes to the Force Timer system help simplify the game while still adding a new layer of counterplay by swapping Dash for Dodge. Most of the characters add a new, unique playstyle to the game as well. Maybe wouldn't recommend as a first BattleCON purchase, but a valuable addition to the game nonetheless.

A much more balanced set than Fate of Indines and contains several of the characters who didn't make the popular vote for what went in the Fate of Indines box during the War of Indines Kickstarter. Trials has some of the most colorful, best, unique, and amusing characters in the game. The components are great, and I love the tuck boxes for the characters. The envelopes in the other games are pretty, but the tuck boxes are far more useful. Force tokens are a fun addition. This set or War of Indines would be the best set for someone looking to try the game.

Copied from my Fate of Indines comment: I've played a lot of fighting games on consoles and PC and this one brings a bit of that flavour to board gaming. Has nice and varied characters and smart gameplay with lots of thinkiness to it.

BattleCON: Trials of Indines is my favourite card duelling game so far. It is simple to learn while scratching all of the card duelling itches. Not really a casual game, I find it difficult to play with young players or gamers without the time to learn the cards. For this reason, despite being a really good game, it won't be seeing much play time in our household.

The new rule book is good. Condensed, clear, no variants (everyone play the same), force gauge is now standard and simplified. Quite better, but there still are a few oversights.
The box is quite big, different format from Fate and War, because of character boxes (ok to keep fighter's tokens and cards together, but why not do an extension for all older characters?). Useless base cards for all characters. So, more expensive than Fate.
Better updated board than previous (well flat and glued, thank you!) but hard to take it out the box, plus more fragile cards and tokens.
Little disappointed by some points but the characters seam interesting, want to play them all!

Rating similar w/ respect to base game (does not significantly improve nor detract from core gameplay). See my review of Devastation of Indines.

This game is REALLY mind-gamey. It's open-knowledge, so all the opponent's cards are available to you and vice-versa. The only problem is that I'm not a detail-oriented person who wants to memorize all the cards to predict both mine and my opponent's turn. I like thinking games, but not this sort.

The first of the BattleCon boxes that I enjoy fully. Level 99 is a great company, although sometimes, I wonder if they put too much emphasis on quantity instead of focusing on balance and development. Trials has 10 characters. That's quite enough. It feels streamlined, simplified and focused (although I can't say yet if it's balanced). It was a pleasure to play and made me revisit a system I had entirely abandoned and replaced with Exceed. The production is solid and the characters are intriguing and varied.

Fast and fun game. Some matchups are obviously unbalanced but the fact that such games are over so quickly means that you can just play with a different matchup.

Even though this set "only" has ten characters, instead of the cornucopia included in larger BattleCON installments, there's still a ton of variety here. Picking the perfect move at the perfect moment is always a satisfying challenge.

Actually this applies to any battlecon set. I’ve been meaning to pick up one. There’s an upcoming remaster of one of the set up for Kickstarter in summer or late spring so I might jump on that

I don't know how many hundred games of Battlecon I have to play before I stop wanting to constantly play it. 

I keep trying to make it stop, and it just won't stop.

RATING: 9.3
Trials is probably the tightest BattleCON set yet, in terms of how the balance has been calibrated; the gap between the weakest and strongest characters in the set is much smaller than for the other cores. On one hand, this unfortunately implies the need for an overhaul of older characters, to varying degrees, in order for the game to reach what I would consider a final state. On the other, at least it gives us a target to aim for when thinking about those balance tweaks.

Another great BattleCon release, ten new characters covering the usual skill curve from Beginner to Master skill level. I think I might like the guy that is a pro wrestler the best, just because of the sheer fun it adds to the atmosphere of the game. This is a great place to start playing if you never have, and well worth picking up for the new fighters if you are already an old pro.

The way the 'Force' has been modified is FAR better, IMO. I am concerned that 'Force' cannot be equally applied to all earlier characters, especially from War Remastered, but it's a small matter.

RATING: 10
I have spent considerable time with this game and I believe it is one of the best consims I've ever played.  In DBP, despite its complexity, every rule, turn, move and decision matters.  Frankly, it's amazing that so many variables in play can lead to such historically plausible outcomes.

It's clear the designer studied this conflict in great detail.  The game plays right out of the pages of Bernard Fall's Hell in A Small Place (which reading before play will enhance the experience considerably).  Everything from the order of battle, time scale of turns, and factors impacting the outcome are all historically accurate.  

It's also clear Kim Kanger labored over each variable to include in the game and how to weight it appropriately.  Weather, terrain, trenching, morale, supply and resource constraints, even desertion are all modeled.  Nothing about the v1.0 rules made the range of potential outcomes not historically plausible.  The v2.0 rules are even more refined.

Overall, this is a genuine conflict simulation that provides a perfect blend of insight and entertainment either solo or 2-player opposed.  I couldn't be more pleased with this game.    If you have a chance to play, do so.  Better off, buy your own copy.

Perhaps one of the best games I have owned and played in years.  While I have several war games, none compare to this game.  The mechanics are well thought out and the playability is exceptional.  The work done to create the barrage components and particularly the airdrops is very well done.  Plenty of supporting aids right on the map for immediate visibility.  It did take me several reads within the rules to assure I was doing things correctly but once I played the game a few times, it all came together.  For me the playability and the historical realism, that was factored into the development of the game, are what make it of most interest.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the designer notes and wish there was more of that so I could understand the logic behind the rules.  

Thanks for a great game.  It holds first place amongst all my well played games.

Recently completed the campaign scenario. Lots of tension right up until the end and I had a good time with the unique combat and supply system. I haven't played anything like this before but it probably won't hit the table again for quite some time as I feel I've now "been there done that". Read "The Last Valley" by Martin Windrow.

Errata to map?
Gabrielle is actually in Zone 2 of 308 division. 

Set up and then tore it down. Shame. Someday ...

September 2017: finally on Turn One. Will see how far I get. Anxious to get Warcults under the plexi. Later: still on Turn One. Very procedural. None of it is confusing (after the initial setup - that was tricky), but the bits to each phase are impossible to keep track of. Definitely have to follow the sequence of play tightly for this entire first campaign I'm sure. Surprised if I ever play a second one though.

So many phases ... and sub-phases.

During Turn Two of Campaign Game I realized I accidentally released VM 9-304 into the fray FAR too early in the game. Oh well, a random ahistorical monkey wrench. Am applying the ammo penalty for remainder of game though. Small boost for the VM I guess?

On Turn 9 and seeing the game pick up speed. I think 50 hours for a first play without a teacher is a fair estimate. At least that's MY experience. Maybe the 24-hour suggested playtime is feasible during second play. The first turns are slow-going due to all of the good assault possibilities. Later, reduced units crowd the map and don't make for the best attackers. Also, the VM will want some rest turns after the first week, and that speeds things up. After week one French units seem to settle into solid defensive positions, and the real siege begins. 

Again, noob perspective here.

Turn 16 - VM Morale track / Replacement track is making for some tight decisions. 308 is close to being Shut Down. Fun for the French to work over reduced VM units and hook them up with cadre counters knowing it's "spend RP and Morale to remove the counters or decide to throw the entire units off the map (likely never to return)". 

And Trench Zones are corralling the French with their LOC-blocking. 

Almost called the game though when the Laos Rescue Force entered play. Looked like the VM was doomed. But I'm glad I kept the game going, as I later noticed much of the Force is weak movie meat.

RATING: 9
A deep and tense experience with fresh but straightforward mechanics. Because of the relentless reduction of the perimeter and the dwindling supplies situation, players really feel the desperation of a siege.  There is much to explore and learn here.  Top-notch components and a well-written rule-set make it a fantastic experience.  Make sure to include the latest game updates which grind down French supplies even more.  Don't miss this one.

RATING: 7
One game in of Scenario C, results are generally positive. As far as I can tell, the game very accurately recreates the siege of Dien Bien Phu, and all of the mechanics felt "right" both in terms of individual actions and the overall narrative it generates, though I must admit I'm not an expert on the subject so others may disagree. The rules are a bit lengthy, but easy to read.

The map and counters look good, although one of my criticisms of the game is that the trench zones are very difficult to discern on the map itself. This is something that could and should be fixed in a future version.

Beyond the map, the game is very process heavy. None of the processes are "wrong" per se, but it does result in a very long game with lots of rules lookups, at least for newer players. Even with experience I think you're looking at 60 minute turns, minimum. The result is that things can feel a bit tedious at times, and I can't help but think some of these processes could have been streamlined without any real loss in fidelity. Plus, this is a siege game. If you're not into sieges, then you should avoid.

But, overall, a very fine game.

RATING: 6
Possibly a bit more granularity in the rules here than I am really looking for. For instance the french have separate supply tracks for food, ammo, medicine, and fuel each and some of these have rather minor game effects. Its a lot of detail and for me the reward isn't always there. In some respects this feels more like a resource management game as the long term strategy calculation is one of attrition, will your different resource tracks or live body numbers deplete to fast. An accurate take on the battle but it hasn't totally engaged me thus far.


--------------------------
Yet, to play (soon, soon), but having digested the rules and set it up.. This is a really unique game, i'm not sure i've come across something quite like it, and i can see why it gets the rave reviews (or perhaps doesn't work for some). The turn sequence has more phases in it that a Victory Games title and it seems sort of excessive, but this approach represents the most narrative focused design philosophy i have seen in a war game.

With the 2015 rules set this is by far the best game on the topic; nothing else comes close.  The experience of it just sucks me in.  It takes a bit of getting used to the unique system but effort is rewarded and the rationale behind the routines emerges in short order.  The graphic touches on the counters and map make play a visual feast; my only complaint is that I wish the French CRT and Viet Minh CRT were on a two-sided card with two provided.  I was not able to follow my opponent's modifiers when first learning to play.  After a while, I could remember them, but it would be a huge help when learning the system.  There's much to commend this title to your table, but one should devote a long weekend to campaign game sessions--and it's well worth the time.  This is the best new game I've played this year, bar none.  If you love tense set-pieces, you simply must experience it.

Hands on the best game on DBP.

Pros: excellent OOB, excellent system, extremely interesting asymmetrical system with strength and weaknesses of the opposing sides extremely well represented; the supply system is a work of art.. 

Cons: it can be a bit frustrating for the VM player (as it was historically), especially if the first attack fail. Could be long.

When a system plays smooth and everything clicks it seems so easy that you don't graps the work behind the design. In this case we have the perfect system for a battle as complex as Dien Bien Phu (1954). Everything clicks, the turn order and the order of battles are asymmetrical, supply is of most importance, the terrain and trenches are vital... And you don't need to go checking the rules, except the battle tables, as everything is so intuitive. Add to this that the counters and map are exquisite and there are a ton of table helps here and there and you have a perfect wargame.

Just received this today. Although it will be a few days at least until I can try to play it, first impressions of the components are *extremely* favorable. Just as good or better than anything GMT or MMP has released.

Rules are 19-20 pages, but it's large font and there are a lot of examples. Probably closer to what I would think of as a 16 page rulebook by typical standards. The system is sort of grand tactical and operational at the same time, very well thought out and clever, typical for a Kanger design. I plan on getting this played in the next couple of weeks, when I have some off work.

Congratulations Kim Kanger and Legion for another beautiful release. The counter art is unique, and beautiful. (although it has some things in common with Kanger's excellent 'Tonkin', which also features beautiful art)

Edit: The best game on this battle. If you have read books on it, and wanted more, this game is for you.

Some justification of the "10" is in order. I use BGG's recommended criteria and rate based on how much I want to play a game. For DPB:TFG, if someone invited me to their house to play the game and I had to go 2 miles on foot through heavy snow, I'd do it. I've been slowly returning to traditional hex-and-counter wargames and this game has largely re-ignited my interest in them. It does a brilliant job of capturing the drama of the battle while at the same time treating the history seriously without bogging down into what Bruce Geryk calls "wargaming literalism".

This is a really unique design that plays smoothly and has a number of interesting subsystems.  (The aesthetics of the game are also top notch.)  My one concern is that I don't quite see a variety of tactics or strategies on hand--in some ways, the game feels like you are along for the ride more than making significant decisions, but I freely admit that the failing may be mine.  In any event, a decidedly interesting take on a difficult battle to simulate.

Very interesting game with unique "chrome".  Just finishing up my 2nd play and will be restarting again.  Having a tough time keeping the VM forces morale at a reasonable level and it's quite challenging trying to find a balance between the offensive and an occasional rest period.  If you don't give each division a rest periodically you'll find them totally spent and incapable of offensive action late in the game.  The supply runs from Hanoi are always interesting as you never know what's going to make it through due to weather issues.  Excellent game, wish I had bought it much sooner!

Things I really like so far:

The map. It's very well done, looks really good, and all the charts are situated around the edges, which I like. I don't like it when the charts are on a separate page, and then I have to find another spot for it somewhere. Everything is within arms reach here.

The counters. They punch out easy (but not as easy as Picket Duty or Adobe Walls), are nice and thick, and with the corners rounded off, they look great. This may be the best looking counter art I've ever seen. Plus, Kim kept it simple with only two large numbers on the counters; Morale (top), and Firepower (bottom). The Viet Minh only have a FP number, as their morale can go up and down. Very simple, and very easy to see. Love the counters.

Keeping counter clutter to a minimum ie The Trench Zone. Instead of having a bunch of Trench counters on all the Viet Minh units, (to show who is entrenched), Kim has set up what he calls a 'Trench Zone.' Every unit in that zone is considered Entrenched. And the Viet Minh can move that zone forward as they takes Strongpoints. I like that idea a lot actually. It keeps the counter clutter down, enabling me to see the counters and the awesome looking art on them, rather then a bunch of 'Trench' counters everywhere. Awesome idea Kim.

The scenario set up chart. At first glance, it looks confusing, with the French unit insignia on both sides of the chart (and the blue and gray colors). But after going through it for scenario A, it works like a charm. And I love the unit symbols on the sides too. Very neat how it works.

Things I'm not so keen on:

Set up. It took me about 40 minutes to set up, mostly because I'm not familiar with the French units, and I had them all in one bag. So I had to sort them first. Some of the unit colors at the top of the counters are easy to see (black, white, yellow and orange), others not so much (the gray and green come to mind). I'll fix that for next time though. I have lots of small bags, so 'll put the reserve units in one bag, and sort the rest accordingly. This is only for the French units, the Viet Minh are easy to differentiate.

Things I would have liked to see in the rules:

Maybe a short description of the French units, and what they did, in the Designers notes. Sure I'm familiar with the US 101st Airborne, and what they did in WW2, but I have virtually no experience with the French units at DBP. Especially after seeing the excellent unit symbols on the set up chart, a little blurb on each unit would have been awesome.

I'll post again as I play the game, but so far I really, really like what I've seen. If it plays half as well as it looks, it's gonna be great. Well done Kim!

Played a couple of turns, then reset up the scenario to start again. I usually go through this, because I tend to make some mistakes in the first couple of turns, which may or may not be pretty important.

Anyway, this game is holding up to the high praise I gave it earlier. There's a lot of steps in each turn, but once you go through it a few times, they aren't hard to remember. I've found even more things about the game that I really like.

The Assault Phase- this is so clean, and easy to handle. I'm surprised more games haven't used a system like this. Very simple too, with most of the VM units having only one number on their counters (strength), when they take a step loss, you flip the counter. Another step loss, add a cadre marker. In both cases, just looking at the unit gives you your basic to hit number.

This game is tense! And hard on the nerves. As the French inflict losses or repel an assault, it causes the VM to feel like they aren't getting anywhere. Then, when the VM fill their losses with replacements, it creates this hopeless feeling for the French, that no matter how many losses they inflict, the VM will keep coming. Very cool how Kim was able to work that into the game.

The Airlift track As the French player, you decide what supplies to airlift in to Dien Bien Phu. This is really interesting. Need more ammo? More medicine or food? You decide what comes in. And since some of the airlifts are going to be turned away by weather or anti aircraft fire, you can never be sure what will make it in. And as the VM trenches get closer to DBP, you'll lose some of your airlift capability. This is an excellent way to get the French player engaged in a something that doesn't seem that exciting (flying in supplies). Works great, and is very simple.

I've played a couple of turns now, and I think this game if just fantastic. One of my top 5 wargames. Everything is just so simple and smooth, that it's a joy to play. And the counters art is amazing. I'm going to rate it a 10, because It's just an amazing game.

Not yet played, so will defer from rating it just yet, but note I'll need the Errata file, so have that to print off. On first look/handle - very nice art production, but one gripe - counter-sheet die-cutting was sub-par to Tonkin and Ici - so much so that, a few counters were actually torn. Irritating but not annoying, but it has delayed me putting this on the table, while I dabble with other new games I have.

This game is a true masterpiece!  Kim Kanger meticulously researched the battle, developed an innovative and elegant system that really works and wrote a rule book that was virtually perfect.  The physical package is absolutely superb.  Kim provides great support for the game and patiently responds to questions (most all of which, truthfully, could be answered by a careful reading of the rule book).  He has made a few excellent tweaks to the game based on post publication playing experience, so be sure to use the latest version of the rules.  I consider this to be one of the very best games of the many hundreds that I have owned.  I bought three copies of this gem.

RATING: 7.5
Great fun and very colourful to look at.  It's a mite expensive, but it's the sort of game that makes others feel they'd like to join in - and that's got to be a good game.

It's ideal as a Christmas game or to play in a mixed group of adults and kids.

Is it the best dexterity game out there?  No.  But it is a lot of fun and scores points for its originality and concept.

RATING: 7.5
+ The physical wheel piece itself creates tons of tension for each block placement; Creatively mean players can really take this game to a whole other level of play.
- With only one rule-set, and no interesting player pieces except the one black starting cone, this game can get repetitive.

An interesting dexterity-ish game.  Turn order, coupled with skill, can lead to the winner so minus points for that.  Additional minus points since the game does not involve a live hamster.  (I was very disappointed to learn that.)

RATING: 9
Rating is for playing with children, physicists or engineers.  This is my niece's favorite game.  With some people prone to analysis-paralysis this game can slow down painfully.  With 2 you have to play the pieces much more aggressively.  I think that this is best with 2-3, with four players the downtime can be more significant.  With adults it can be an alternative to say that you cannot hold the wheel at all while placing your piece.  I have yet to find anyone who does not like playing this game.

RATING: 6.5
More fun than I thought initialy. Has the potential for sneeky tactical play as you setup other players for a fall (pun intended). However, it's that kind of game where the sitting order can influence who wins.

Takes a lot of table space!

Even better than we'd imagined - you can play some really sneaky moves, and there seems to be quite a bit of strategy in the four player game :)

Very novel and fun game to bring out for casual gatherings.  You do need a good sturdy, level table to play on...  The little rule nuances make this game more than just a novelty: Only one piece per color per section. Must keep advancing the wheel. The round dowel piece wants to roll. etc.  I think it could have used 1 more round piece to give the game slightly more challenge (but then, that might just make the runaway leader problem worse too).  It's a perfect gathering game that always evokes smiles and laughs.

Dexterity game about knowing when and where to stack your pieces in a giant wheel. If the piece falls off you get it and will have to place it again later. It's a game that not only requires a steady hand but a good understanding of when and where to play your pieces to try to set up the next player or so to fail.

Only played once. A fun anti-Jenga, with players taking it in turns to add a piece to one side of the wheel. Any pieces that fall off during your turn you have to pick up. First to run out of pieces wins. If you like dexterity games you'll enjoy this.

RATING: 6
Silly dexterity game.  Lots of tension as the pieces come close to falling out the the wheel.  The only drawback is the the game can potentially take a loooong time if played by over-competitive people, as its possible to continually place the pieces in very unstable positions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This ones great fun. Very simple to learn but you need a steady hand and need to judge how far the weight of the piece you place will move the wheel.

RATING: 6
I bought this for my wife for her birthday in 2012. She fell in love with it a few years ago and was thrilled that I got her a copy. It's another solid dexterity game but one that suffers from people being set up for easy turns based on when pieces fall out of the wheel. It doesn't matter much for such a short, light-hearted game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Curious, interesting-looking balancing game that's fun for awhile (rating 6), but seems like it has a serious, even fatal flaw - it can last way too long (minus a point to rating 5).  Then it's repetitive, boring.  Generates the "please make it stop" feeling. Another flaw, a smaller one - it rolls, moves from turn to turn across the table, requiring you to move it back, possibly making pieces fall off on a non-turn.

I love Zoch games' production quality. They inevitably have bright colorful pieces which are engaging. Hamsterrolle is no exception.

I enjoy the flow and the tension of this game. The blend of dexterity (being able to gently place the pieces) is mixed with equal components of vision (being able to anticipate accurately what your placement will do to the wheel/pieces and thirdly, strategy (where you make placements which are designed to foil the player after you). Because of these things, the game keeps you very interested and making decisions.

My one beef is that I wish there were an internal clock in the game, which would end it at a certain point. Otherwise, the game can theoretically go on indefinitely....and sometimes DOES go on for quite a while. We thought of perhaps setting a "finish line" that if the ring folls across it...whoever has the least pieces wins. This will also add one more element of strategy, in trying to purposefully roll the ring forward. 

I'd happily play this any time, although I don't know that I'd want to pass up a great boardgame for it. It makes a great change of pace in the middle of 'serious' games, though.

Fun, and rather unique dexterity game.  Players race to be the first to place their seven coloured pieces into the "Hamster Wheel".  The wheel, a circular wooden frame, contains a dozen or so ledges that pieces can be rested on.  As pieces get added, the wheel begins to travel across the table, and pieces can fall out (given to the player whose turn it is).  Fun, and rather ingenious.

[3 plays] This game has intrigued me from afar for a long time, and recently I finally got to try it.  I'm pretty bad at it, but I really enjoyed it.  I'm not a big fan of dexterity games, but this seems to be one of the more pleasing ones I've encountered.  I've only played it 2-player, and think I prefer it that way.  With a lot of players in a dexterity game, you get some really dull downtime, or you get to be entertained by the other players.  I don't find it that amusing standing around laughing and waiting for Bob to knock over the tower.  2-player dexterity seems to have about the right speed and suspense level for me.  My other favorite dexterity game, Elchfest, is 2-player only.  Hamsterrolle is very visually appealing, and a different approach from most.  It's nifty.  I wouldn't mind having a copy.

Fun, and unique dexterity game that is fairly quick.
It is interesting to attempt to balance the pieces in a moving wheel and pretty tactical as well as you balance them precariously so they will fall in the next players turn, or if the wheel goes to far, but will remain in their place long enough for you to pass the turn. 

Need a long and flat table however

We spend more time arguing over the rules than balancing pieces, but Hamster Rolle works. It's a good fun dexterity game, but the rules are too complicated and too vague at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A unique, colorful, attractive and surprisingly fun dexterity game. That fun tension of 'are those pieces going to fall?' happens quckly and constantly, and there's tactical fun to be had in which pieces you use when, especially relative to the other players, as well as the take-that of exactly how you place your pieces. It just... works.

This simple dexterity game doesn't have a complex set of rules, but the game's English translation so confused me I wasn't sure how to play the game.  So Mike Herms, Thank you for uploading Pitt Crandlemire's English translation here in the BGG files.  

Be sure to follow the rule, "1 piece only in the start player's compartment," otherwise it is indeed too easy.  It is a cute idea with nice, colorful wood components.  If you like Bamboleo, Bausack, Paletti, or Arch Rival, then you will probably like this.  Nice family game.

One of the most enjoyable games i have ever played.  Simple concept, there is a hampster wheel, free to roll along the table.  it has blocks stuck to the inside.  you need to get all your blocks on the inside, but further to (preset direction) to the last block placed, causing the wheel to rotate.  whatever falls out, goes in your stack.

I do like the construction-y games, but very few of them actually walk away from you.  This one does.  Very fun.  We played it on a utility carpet, which went quite well, but we will have to try it again on something even smoother for extra motion.  I actually give this a 7 in terms of game play, but another half point for the great, colorful, wooden bits.  And ANOTHER half point for the instructions.  Hilarious and complete -- the way instructions ought to be written.  Poor Albert.

Hamsterrolle is another dexterity game of the "place a piece without making things fall down" variety. The big hamster wheel makes it a bit more gimmicky than most and it certainly looks attractive on the table but I don't think it actually is an improvement over simpler implementations like Animal Upon Animal, for example.

An delightful dexterity game.  Hamsterrolle has a few silly rules but ultimately the basics of the game create tension and a lot of fun. A lot more luck here than what I normally take from a dexterity game. However, the unpredictability is a slight part of the charm. A very decent dexterity filler.

I can't remember the last game I played that was so minimalistic in its aesthetic form yet so enthralling to play. This game is literally a balancing dexterity game based on the concept of the hamster wheel. The purpose of the game is incredibly simple: get rid of all your pieces. Where things get a big more interesting is that you can only place pieces in the "rolling direction" of the wheel, and there are placement rules which make it such that situations that are precarious pop up repeatedly (and  failing to balance newly added pieces means that you acquire all the pieces that fall off). A match never takes too long -- and I felt engaged even when it wasn't my turn (i.e., this game produces a real sense of suspense). While I still think my favorite dexterity game is Villa Paletti, this game offers an interesting and novel take on dexterity). Totally a great tactile and visual experience.

The game was a lot of fun, and the way the board rolls really made it interesting.  Players have to get pieces into a round wheel and balance them without pieces falling out.

Hamsterrolle is a great dexterity game with some amazing wooden pieces.

Watching the loop change through play is really fascinating and each turn is something different.  Fun little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game consists of a wooden hoop with ledges attached to the inner rim. Each player is given an identical set of 8 blocks, each block being a unique color and shape. Players take turns placing blocks on ledges inside the hoop. If any blocks fall out in this process, the player has to keep them. 1st player to run out of blocks wins. When playing with 4, then there are two teams and the first team to place all of their blocks wins. You cannot place blocks of the same color in the same section, which forces players to find ways to either make a new ledge available on which to place, or to leave your opponent with no good placement options. If you feel you can't place anything, then you can move blocks from the bottom two sections, which gives you the only chance to alter the orientation in the opposite direction. 

I love dexterity games just as much for how beautiful and unusual they look on the table as the game-play. The rules for Hamsterrolle get a little ambiguous in places and the limited placement options make it not quite as interesting as some of my other games in this category. Game-play gets a 6 out of 10, but I'm giving it an extra point just for the sheer pleasure of seeing this beast in action.

Good bye Villa Paletti! This is good (even great?) dexterity game with "a lots of going on".

Nice game when there are 3-4 "shaky hands". ;)

Imagine a hamsters exercise wheel, divided into numerous segments, separated by low fences (obviously a National Hunt racing hamster). The players each receive seven wooden pieces, which they aim to place ( one per person per turn ) within the wheel without any pieces falling out. Any pieces dislodged are taken back as a penalty and the first to get rid of their pieces wins.

Team-up with a partner and try to outwit your opponents by placing various wooden objects of different shapes and sizes onto a large hamster wheel that rolls.

Played both Hamsterrolle and Bausack on the same day. Although Hamsterrolle had the flashier components – who doesn’t want to take a giant hamster wheel for a spin? – Bausack won my heart in this game category. Hamsterrolle just seemed one dimensional – place a piece and don’t make things fall – while Bausack had more to it, namely a really interesting auction phase for pieces each round. Lots of evil auctioning all around to mess with everyone.

To paraphrase a famous quote 'Do unto others as they will do to you'.  Truly Hamsterrolle is a game where what goes around comes around.  Mischievous fun.  In my opinion the Hamster Wheel provides a more engaging and entertaining platform for balancing your pieces compared to the disc in Bamboleo and the ever increasingly dull tower of Jenga.

A comparison to Bamboleo is instructive as in Hamsterrolle I was able to predict the consequences of my action much easier and the movement of the wheel added to the experience.  Whether this means Bamboleo is the more complex or if balancing items on a 'horizontal' plain is more difficult for my brain I am unsure but I found Hamsterrolle to be more immediate, have greater accessibility and less of the tension of Bamboleo. Therefore I would be more eager to introduce Hamsterrolle to families.  Plus it does less damage to your table when the pieces fall off which may gain favour with parents.

Two-player: This feels a bit flat with two (no pun intended). The wheel is fun, but we both agreed it would be more fun with additional players.

Although with just two plays, it's also possible we weren't seeing much of its subtlety. The second game went much longer than the first, suggesting that; plays were more clever, and meaner.

I want to try again with more people.

---

Four-player: This is much, much better with four than with two. More improbable structures survive in more improbable ways, the game shifts back and forth, and it's just plain more fun with more people involved. I probably wouldn't play this with two again.

Re-rated from a 7 to an 8. This is consistently fun, and I love that it's a dexterity game slanted to silliness and wicked, surprising plays almost from the get-go.

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Dexterity game of placing odd shaped pieces in a spoked "hamster" wheel. Get rid of your pieces to win.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Visually it's a very impressive game; the kind that will draw in curious observes and tempt them to give it a try. The rolling wheel is pretty unique. All the bright colored blocks make it so pretty.

Cons: I don't like the linear fashion of play (I thought dexterity games evolved beyond this when it was discovered Jenga wasn't cool anymore) where players are supposed to play progressively around the wheel. I understand this is fundamental to the mechanics of the game but too often it feels like it forces the player into a singular, seemingly, no-win decision.

Other: I'm not sure I played with the rules as they were intended or based off a third party printout. Either way, it was a bad translation that resulted in some frustration before we even started playing. Also the game seemed like it had a weak spot with three players.

Best Use: A unique styled game for the dexterity collector, or a pull-in game at a convention.

Nice little filler game in the mould of Jenga, Penguin Pileup, Ker-Plunk. Players take it in turn to place wooden blocks on shelves of the internal wall of a wheel. As pieces are placed the wheel turns, making the blocks more precarious. If pieces fall off on your go you collect,. The person with no pieces left is winner. Nice game with lots of tension.

A dexterity game with a big wooden circle with tiny blocks set on the inside of it.  Every player gets a set collection of blocks.  There are some rules about how placement works, but I will not bother you with those right now.  

The goal of the game is to get all of your pieces inside of the 'Hamster Wheel' without knocking others out.  If you knock other blocks out, you acquire them and have to also get rid of them.  As you place, the wheel slowly starts rolling along the length of the table precariously making the first placed blocks become closer and closer to being upside-down!  

The game is tons of fun and as my group loves their dexterity games, this will never leave my collection.

First impression: It's an eye catcher. When you're playing it people want to see what's going on. It is a good dexterity game. Wheel shape is at same time familiar and unpredictable. It's just hard enough to know when will pieces fall off.
The teamplay didn't seem to work well. Either the players were too good or bad but the game seemed to stall at some point. When one team had few pieces left the other team managed to construct a near impossible position were next two moves in sequence dropped something and game went on. That took longer than it should have and wasn't fun anymore.

It's simple in concept - a turn is to place your piece, first one to get rid of their pieces wins. The rolling wheel provides a level of intra-game fun that most dexterity games don't provide (at least until they topple over and end). It's still coming out regularly and is recommended in its genre as a family game as it allows all ages to compete well. With just adults, although it's still fun, you're usually (but not always) able to get rid of all your pieces without a failure, giving advantage to the randomly chosen first player, but you're not playing this type of the game for the winning, and oftentimes we play so as to see if we can get around the wheel multiple times in a game.

This game was very cool for 15 minutes until the first player won out (me). Then it dragged as none of the remaining 3 couldn't seem to edge each other out. There's got to be a fix for this.  I thouroughly enjoyed playing this while I did.

Also a very beautiful game to behold. Bright colors and nice components.

In typical Zoch fashion the game looks good.  Excellent dexterity game.  Slightly better than Villa Paletti because the weakest player doesn't ruin the experience (and the building like in Villa Paletti!) for everyone.  There's still some minor problems left-right, but it's minimal.  You can easily play this with kids (mine is 8) and everyone will still have fun. -- Fixed this problem with carpenter's glue: (I received it with 3 of the black "platforms" not attached anymore.  Perhaps all the game pieces inside the game shifted and knocked them off.  They should have a compartment to reduce the odds of this happening.)  That being said, Zoch offered to send me another "wheel" if I couldn't get it fixed.  Ferti has a long way to go to catch up in the customer service department.  (Kudo's to all the companies I've dealt with that have shipped me parts: Rio Grande Games, Mayfair, Fantasy Flight, Doris & Frank, Warfrog, (and now, hypothetically) Zoch.)

Requires a steady hand and imagination how to put your pieces. Of course the basics of mechanics will help. Skill is the main point, but still there is room for luck: the reactions of pieces can be surprising. 

The pieces are different enough, the rules are clear and logical, the big wheel looks fun. The only weird thing was that "black hat" penalty-weight, that one's point I didn't get... 

Great fun!

Edit: Works also with 3 players - perhaps better than with any other combinations.

Like many dexterity games, this one feels less like a game of skill (esp. in the end game) than one that you keep playing with a minimum of strategy for a bit longer than you should, then someone turns out to be the winner because of a kind of mild chaos.  Still, it's another take on such games, though I prefer Villa Paletti and Bausack.

Good clean fun. Initially I thought this would not hold a candle to Bamboleo, but it actually did offer a different and less stringent game. In Bamboleo one bad move and you have to setup the entire game again. In Hamsterrolle, one bad move and you have setup yourself for failure, but you can make up for it. You can also set traps for the opponent, so it is a lot more interactive. Really good game.

This is a really thrilling dexterity game where you place differently shaped and weighted items in the spokes of this wheel. The rules for placement encourage the wheel to roll in one specific direction, and if any previously placed bits fall off, you have to claim them. The goal is to get rid of your pieces first. There is so much wonderful tension in this game and interesting choices about how and what your next placement will be.

Dexterity game -- see pictures of the game for a better idea. In this game, it's quite amazing to see how some block placements seem to defy gravity. It's because the "base" moves, and so it's trickier to see whether a piece placement will work simply by looking at the structure.

What sort of sucks (compared to other stacking dexterity games) is that your choices are quite limited. Games like Blockhead offer much more creativity with regards to how and where you can place your piece. But the thrill of momentum (i.e. the moving wheel in which you place pieces) sort of makes up for the lack of variety of placement choices.

There is something really striking about this game that I find really attractive.  However, what drew me to it as a game is the use of gravity (and friction) in the rolling/rotating board.

Played once with 3P. Hamsterrolle has quite a strong strategic aspect for a balancing dexterity game. Having some creativity is useful when sneaking in pieces without upsetting the wheel's balance. The rules, however, could be better written, and the game dragged a little when players continually set up the wheel to become imbalanced with the next piece put in. It really is attention-grabbing though, especially when the wheel begins to turn.

RATING: 7
This game is pretty, with some good ideas, but for a strategy dexterity game I prefer Tokami or Polarity.  The problem is that players are constantly put in a position where they physically cannot place a piece.  This forces a pass and the player after the passing player now has to take the big risk of playing another piece.  It is good enough, but there are just better dexterity games out there, and for the price you should consider the others first.  

UPDATE: The game improves greatly when you are forced to place your piece, rather than to feign.  I call it the anti-asshole rule.

Fun dexterity game, and you've got to love the really cool wheel. It's just fun to see how far vertically up some pieces can go before they fall out, and sometimes forcing someone's hand based on the color of the piece you play can be delightfully devilish.

This game is pure fun.  What else needs to be said?  Not much, that's what else doesn't need to be said.  It's "Jenga" in a wheel, complete with decent wood components.  It will test your dexterity, you poise, your steadiness, your fine motor skills while intoxicate, and your ab muscles if you start laughing too much.  Perhaps the only thing that might have improved the game is some different shapes with the pieces.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

[Zoch 2003 edition] {Abstract; dexterity, partnership; optimal 2vs2} Hamsterrolle is a unique and decent dexterity game. The wheel is eye-catching. It's very exciting and interesting to watch the wheel rolling. It's fun and full of player interaction. It's expensive but it is worth.

Players have some decisions: the different shaped pieces provide tactical options. Players can decide the order of placement, and which piece to place in order to force other players to place wooden pieces further.
 A minor problem of Hamsterolles is that the wheel may stick into a location that adding new pieces is not possible and players are forced to pass or drop piece. In this way, the game may drag on a while.

The production quality of Hamsterolle is very good. The fiction of wooden cubes is nicely tuned. The colors are sharp and shapes are consistent.  Thumb up!

RATING: 8
Played 10+ times.  This game is just silly and fun.  I really enjoy the tactile and visual feel of the game.  I think I take it too seriously and have several rules questions that I can't seem to find answers too.  UPDATE: I've never had a game with so many rules questions.  I think this is the case because the game is analog and my friends are gamers.  The rules are not detailed enough and I'm going to have to create a list of "Mike's annal house rules". 2006/09/07

tl;dr: more of the same Zoch goodness

If you've played other Zoch titles like [thing=293][/thing] or [thing=118695][/thing] you kind of know what to expect from this game. Players each in turn place one of their wooden pieces in an effort to get rid of all of them first. There are some placement rules and if something falls off and hits the table, you have to add it to your hand.
I quite enjoy games like these and I enjoyed this one too. But I think I do prefer those 2 other titles I mentioned.

A very fun, dexterity game with some tactical decisions. The best games I have had have been 2-player games, where you can definitely impact the other player and force him to play something that might just help you. A bit expensive; it is definitely worth it.

The Mercedes-Benz of dexterity games.  Not only is Hamsterrolle eye-catching, but it sustains the tension throughout the game with a unique twist.  Instead of one catastrophic collapse of pieces (as with nearly all dexterity games), Hamsterrolle sustains the tension over time with a series of smaller falls.  The result is pure delight.

Very fun dexterity game with fantastic components.  Plays a lot better when players are "pushing it" by placing their pieces as far along the wheel as possible.  If everyone plays it safe, there isn't nearly as much action.  Doesn't have a ton of staying power, but I don't know if any dexterity games really do.

Hamsterrolle is a Zoch game (from the same people that brought you Bausack and Bamboleo) that I played 5 times in November. It’s yet another game where the winner is the first to get rid of all of his or her pieces, you place one piece per turn, and have to gain pieces when you knock the teetering structure over (just like Tier Auf Tier, Arbos, and Chairs). It’s got an interesting element that those other games lack, which is that the whole structure rolls as more pieces are added because you’re adding pieces inside a giant wheel, forever going clockwise so that the wheel inevitably rolls, knocking pieces out along the way. It’s familiar, but with a neat twist, just like you’d expect from a Zoch game.

I enjoyed this more than any other stacking dexterity game I have tried.  The rolling action and the differently sized pieces actually seem to allow for some strategic play.  Sometimes you get a break and can use one of your bigger pieces, sometimes you have to very carefully place a smaller, lighter piece to avoid shifting the game.  I haven't decided that it's worth the heafty price, though.

As long as all or most people play aggressively and take some risks, this is a great dexterity game. It can quickly become boring if everyone will play conservatively, as a lot of the fun is seeing yourself or others fail in their grand schemes! 

Some fascinating piece arrangements can happen with risky placements, and the game has yet to fail to entertain my regular gaming partners even after several games in a row.

If ratings were on how beautiful a game is Hamsterrolle would be top five material. The game is just magnificent to see. While playing is also fun, the game seems uncertain of its own aspirations of deeper strategy. If I want to stir strategy up in my dexterity game, I'll pick Bausack (or maybe even Stack Market.) As a straightforward encounter of keeping your hand steady or suffering the consequences, Hamsterrolle excels. While I always like these sorts of things the first ten minutes, without that extra strategy layer, I get antsy to move on before the last piece remains, balanced however precariously. **Note: The very best framework for judging any dexterity game is in Cavedog_pdx's comment.

Another dexterity game which I truly enjoy.  This one is a bit cut throat as the goal is to leave the next person in a position where they roll the wheel and make pieces fall.   Actually the goal is to get rid of your pieces but I often redefine the conditions for victory in games.  The mechanism is pretty simple.  Everyone has identical wooden pieces.  No spoke can have two of the same color on it.  Any piece you play must be higher than any other piece.  If you make pieces fall off they're yours.

For a dexterity game, this one is better than most.  It takes some clever placements to shine at this game, so you're not at the mercy of the laws of physics for every turn of the game.  Plus, placing your tiles in a tactical way can push the balance (ha!) to other players.

A mass-produced $15 version wouldn't be a bad deal.  If you're tempted to shell out $50 for the import, I'd suggest putting the money towards life counseling instead.

Yet I would pay $1000 for an oversized upgrade with a twenty foot hoop and life-threatening pieces: refrigerators, throwing knives, cement poles, and cardboard boxes containing live animals.

Dexterity games are in a class by themselves and are hard to take for anything but what they are - dexterity based.  However, Hamster Wheel does have some strategy to it in trying to fit pieces into the wheel well so they don't fall out yet try to get them to fall out for your opponent.  In the end, it is what it is - a wheel full of fun for the family!

RATING: 6
Super neat 2p abstract tetris-like game. Those who are fans of spacial relations and visual puzzles will get a charge out of it, while those who aren't will struggle (in the same ways that SET favors those who have the pattern recognition skills). Part of the balance between these two groups comes in the form of the catch-up variant which deters a run-away leader effect.

I have never seen a game humble otherwise intelligent adults (who then started working on teams to solve in particularly onerous puzzle) as I have Ubongo Duel.  The potential to play this after about 2 pints at the pub with a healthy dose of trash talking would be a unique an entertaining experience... Not sure how serious I'd want to take this game in that regard, that's ok, just a caveat.

The design of this game is worthy and it undoubtedly has some broad appeal.  Racing to complete "shape puzzles" can definitely be fun in a frothy "hurry up!" sort of way, but in my experience, games like this often result in pointlessly bruised feelings for gamers who are simply not lightening fast in their ability to complete "shape puzzles."  

For those who are lightening fast, this game might be enjoyable as you dominate others, and for those like myself who are very close to lightening fast much of the time, I suppose I could enjoy beating those who are not.  For some reason though, I am just not yet convinced that this particular skill makes me better in any way, and as such winning doesn't feel particularly enjoyable.

This is an interesting one.  It seems that I can either visualize the solution in a minute or two or I never seem to be able to figure it out.  To me this is a little dry, not as much fun as Factory Fun, another puzzle solving game, but we'll see how it does after more plays.  Quite a few of my friends seem to like this one.

Good 2 person filler, but somehow not as compelling as lost cities.

When I first discovered this game, I wasn't expecting too much as the original Ubongo game was a tad too simple and repetitive. But after playing this gem, I bit the bullet and decided to import a copy. Why? Because the spatial puzzles in this game are much more challenging... to the point where a rather intelligent person may feel quite stupid. And the experience of trying to find the solution, before your opponent, is simply exhilarating. 

My only complaint is that the pieces fit together too-snugly... to the point where they could fray/bend as players rush to complete the puzzle. It would be nice if they re-released this game with plastic pieces instead of cardboard.

AMAZING!
The best of the series.
I was contemplating buying a second set to make a 4 player game.

The best part about this is that it chucks the timer.  This is almost requisite as some of the puzzles are downright improbable!

Definitely a step up in difficulty from the original, and very simple scoring makes for a very enjoyable game.

Really hard Ubongo! Wish the boards were cardboard and not just paper, but I wouldn't have wanted to pay too much more for the game so I guess it's fine. The 4 piece puzzles are quite challenging. I got one of the 5 piece puzzles, but it felt like I kind of lucked into the solution.
I thought the standard Ubongo puzzles were a little bit too easy, so I'm glad we got this game. I enjoy the more straightforward two player scoring better as well, especially the 'catch-up' variant.

Surprisingly good, Ubongo Duel is the game the original Ubongo should have been, that is challenging and focusing on hard puzzles rather than aggravating players with silly gems to collect and annoying time limits: moreover, the addition of a fifth tile makes for a much more entertaining fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One of the best parts of Ubongo is that you don't have to be better than the other players all the time in order to win -- there's enough variability in the scoring that a player who's good, but not the best, has a good shot at it.

This is thrown out in Ubongo - Das Duell.  The player who is better will win every. single. time.  This makes it a painful experience for two players who are not at absolutely the [u]exact[/u] same skill level.

Still fun, and it's good that the puzzles are more challenging that the original's.  But this issue ruins the most unique and attractive part of Ubongo.

If you love puzzles (particularly tangrams), then you'll love Ubongo.  We got the Duel version because it's supposedly the hardest, and also perfect for two.  Well, if it is the hardest, don't tell that to Ashar - she is a demon at this thing, are routinely yells Ubongo before I've got 3 pieces in semi-auspicious formation.  Yes, I suck at this, at least compared to her.  But it is damn fun.

Yeow! This is hard! My wife fell in love with regular Ubongo, and so did the rest of my family. So, I picked up Ubongo Duel for weeknight gaming with my wife.

Even the four-puzzle-piece side is noticeably more difficult. However, that also means it's more of a challenge. We got our rears kicked by the new puzzles, but that adds to replayability.

I kinda miss the gem collecting. I understand that it doesn't really work with two, but when it's straight-up puzzle solving, it seems a bit blunt. With the gems and 3-4 people, there's a bit more gamesmanship, and I like that aspect.

Update: Traded away in a math trade along with Jab and 10 Days in Africa for Bootleggers. Well... my wife preferred the original Ubongo. When you take away the gem collecting, you're simply left with puzzle solving, and not much game. Sure, the puzzles are harder, but surprisingly, this "purer" form of a speed puzzle game left us wanting for something else.

I made acquaintance with Ubongo in 2007 or 2008, and rather liked the Tetris-like puzzling. However, the edition I played was far too simply for me and my partner, so I went in search of a more difficult edition. Upon learning that this edition would meet my demands, I snatched up a copy. I've played it several times since.

The puzzles in this edition are indeed more complex, and that seems to be both a good and a bad thing. The good thing is that there is more of a challenge to the entire affair, keeping replayability high. The bad thing is that the puzzle is sometimes so difficult that the only thing left to do is to methodologically search for a solution. This aspect doesn't tax human creativity and is therefore a boring activity to undertake. It highlights the fundamental shortcoming of Ubongo: puzzles should be difficult, but not [i]too[/i] difficult. In this edition, the balance is slightly off.

Ubongo for 2 players.  Basically two players duel on the same puzzles over potentially nine rounds.  First to five points wins.  Puzzles are either "easy" (ha!) four piece or diabolical five piece puzzles - you tune the difficulty.  Fun stuff, but much more difficult than basic Ubongo.  The five piece puzzles are very difficult.

Great implementation of the Ubongo idea in a MUCH smaller 2-player format.  Each person gets a number of pieces, then you roll a 20-sided die to determine which 4 or 5 you will use on your puzzle.  The puzzles now come on double-sided thick paper rather than cardboard, but that's fine.

[4 plays] I approached Ubongo Duel with wary interest, having enjoyed Ubongo (but thought the scoring system was foolish), but disliked Ubongo Extreme.  I’m happy to report good things of this 2p version.  

First, it’s like regular Ubongo in that it uses Tetrisy-looking pieces that are made of squares, not some other shape.  Again like regular Ubongo, all the puzzle mats are double-sided, with a harder and an easier side (the difference being they use one piece more/less in the puzzle).  I like how this allows you to vary the difficulty or even handicap the game.  

The main difference from regular Ubongo is that both players here are doing the EXACT same puzzle.  This could have a downside, as you can no longer kid yourself that you lost because your puzzle happened to be harder.  But I found it nice in another way, because when you lost, if you were still interested to see how to do the puzzle, you could get either a hint or the whole solution from the other player.

Production is still excellent, except that the puzzle mats are now thick glossy paper instead of tiles.  This reduces their durability and fabulousness, but allows the game to fit into the traditional Kosmos-sized box.  The mats could be laminated, and even as they are, would probably last a very long time with careful handling.

I was worried about replayability, but there are 9 mats, each with 2 sides (hard/easy), and on each side 20 possible puzzles.  So I don’t see that being a problem.  

On each side of each mat, the shape to be made is the same, and there are 20 different configurations of pieces that could possibly make that shape.  I found that staggering to contemplate, and definitely take my hat off to the designer.  I find it challenging enough to do one puzzle, never mind thinking up 19 alternate paths to the identical solution!  

Scoring--in my opinion the weakness of the original game--is simplified here, because you’re just going head-to-head to see who can finish the puzzle first.  There’s a little scoring-path board, and whoever is the first to win 5 duels wins the game.  Of course you could vary this in many ways: playing a predetermined number of puzzles, playing for a preset amount of time, playing tennis-style scoring where you have to have at least X points and lead by at least 2 puzzles, etc.  There’s also ample opportunity for handicapping if you wanted to.  

I think this would be a fine addition to any 2-player household that likes Ubongo.

Acquired Feb 2010 - Similar to Ubongo but with harder puzzles.  It is also just a two player race without all the silly gem stuff. therefore, it is pure puzzle solving without the "side game" of the markers. Still, not much of a "game" but can be used for kids developing their "skills". so, 5/10

Much harder than regular Ubongo. Ubongo had 3- and 4-piece puzzles, and Das Duell has 4- and 5-piece puzzles. Das Duell also removes all the randomness from the game. Both players have the same puzzle to solve each round, and the winner always gets one point rather than a semi-random gemstone award. Regular Ubongo has a frantic pace, this one is slower and more thoughtful. I prefer these puzzles, but miss the multiplayer format of the original Ubongo.

This plays like a streamlined Ubongo.  When you only have 2 players, you'll play this over Ubongo.  Puzzles are tougher, but if you can swing the 4 tile games on Ubongo, you can do this.   I handily defeated my kids the first 2 playings of this game, which tends to have the effect of souring them on the game.    I won't let them give up though.

It's OK, but after getting know 'classic' Ubongo and Ubongo Extrem first, I'm not so excited about it.  It's still the same completing the puzzles, but there are nuances that make the difference.  Duell is on par with Extrem, but, for me, inferior to 'classic' Ubongo.

RATING: 7.75
Rated after twelve "4-piece puzzle" games with my wife, who is a much stronger puzzle solver than me.  The first game was the "standard" game and she smoked me 5 - 0.  For the next games we played the "variant" and while she won it did make the games closer.  The "double puzzle" rounds are very tense for the leader.  The purest of the Ubongo games as it is ALL about head-to-head puzzles.  The irregularly shaped pieces did cause some headaches, and it is hard to say whether these puzzles are harder than Extrem.

Finally in game #6 I get a win... 5 - 4.  Yay!!

All and all, for two-players this is great puzzler.  For equal solvers the "standard" game will work great, and if you need a handicap the "variant" will give the weaker player an opportunity to gain ground.

My one issue is the paper puzzle sheets.  After the cardboard tiles, these feel flimsy and I worry about wear and tear.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (February 2012)

It’s been a long time since I played Ubongo: Duel but I remember I liked it. In fact I have liked very Ubongo version I have played. I suck at all of them but they are very entertaining. My spatial intelligence is kind of low.

It is considerable harder than basic Ubongo (a plus in my book) and I love two player games(they play so quick, very low downtime). I REALLY like that both players will be competing using the SAME puzzle, this is great for me because it is fair and it is truly a battle of spatial wits. Also like the new (fairer) scoring system.

I remember some of the components were kind of flimsy so they damaged rather quickly. 

Bottom line, Ubongo: Duel is an ok game I would play from time to time. There is a possibility I will buy it. As soon as I play it again I will come back to re comment.

Maybe I'm just stupid, but the 5-piece puzzles are too difficult for me.  I don't have a systematic method for solving these things, and some of them took me way too long where I felt like giving up.  I felt the same way about the 4-piece Ubongo Extrem puzzles.  So if I'm only going to play the A side (4 pieces), why not just play regular Ubongo and implement the scoring method used here?  I kind of like the random scoring used in the original Ubongo game - the luck seemed to even out.  With this game, it's just a puzzle race, and I'm just not good enough at puzzles to feel like this is fun.

Harder than the original Ubongo, with a bit of a twist.

In Duel, it is all about solving the puzzles - there are now jewels to collect.

The puzzles take longer to solve, and players go head-to-head trying to solve the same puzzle at the same time. There is a sense of accomplishment when you solve a puzzle in this game as opposed to the original.

Less of a gateway game than the original, but I would recommend it to people who love the puzzles in the original.

Wowzer!  Much more difficult puzzles with some odd shaped pieces to puzzle into the picture.  Five pieces are particularly difficult!  Just two player - first to five wins.

RATING: 6
The easiest game to explain I've seen. You just take the components out of the box and everybody gets it. The only thing I have to say against it is that the "wining" depends on personal skills that go beyond logic, so you cannot "teach" how to improve your gameplay. Also, I think this game would work better as a party game making groups, and this "duel" edition can only accommodate two (groups).

Being the "hardest" of all the Ubongo games, this would seem that this would need to be played by two people who are matched somewhat evenly. That being said, there is a mechanism whereby someone leading with 3 points (out of 5) scored, must win 2 in a row in order to advance one space on the chart.

A good, quick 2-player puzzle challenge. Puzzles are more complicated than in the original 4-player version, which is nice, although the components aren't quite as nice given that the puzzle boards are printed on card-stock rather than thick cardboard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy this a lot as a solo puzzle, but I'd rather play something else with an opponent, particularly since many of these puzzles take some time to solve. That's nice in a solo puzzle but kind of annoying in a head-to-head game.

This competition is purely a question of finishing first. You could do the same with duplicate crosswords, jigsaws, sudoku, or any other solo puzzle. Contrast with Ricochet Robots, which has an element of evaluation -- you might be the first to answer, but someone might find a more efficient solution.

Man I was so excited about this game.  I love Ubongo and was excited to see a nice variant.

There are some technical issues with the production that ruin what would be an excellent game though.

I'll start with the not-so-important but dissapointing. From reading the rules, seeing the example pictures, and then examining the score board, it is clearly misprinted.  Instead of having the two sides (normal game and variant) it has the variant scoring board on both sides. I can forgive that, along with the flimsy player sheets (coming from the thick cardboard player boards from Ubongo it is a bit of a disappointment.)

What I cannot forgive is the pieces not fitting together. They are entirely too tight. If you do manage to interlock them, you'll damage them in the process of taking them apart quickly looking for other solutions during a game.

The misprint and the flimsy sheets don't affect the gameplay. The pieces not fitting correctly (they should be much looser) ruins a game I was very excited about.

btw, this is the Z-man edition.  If the Kosmos edition is better, someone please let me know.  I'd love to pick that one up, if it is.

2-player Ubongo.  Better than the original in that the puzzles are more challenging and each player is competing on the same puzzle -- which is really more fair.

The [i]Ubongo[/i] franchise continues in its purest form. I got my wish: five-piece puzzles! Sometimes we're able to solve them fairly quickly, but there have been other times when we've sat there for many minutes, going in circles and completely baffled. Next game we might try using a three-minute timer: when it runs out, call the tough ones a draw. I do miss the timed element from the other [i]Ubongo[/i] games. And the jewels . . . [13 plays]

If you've never played Ubongo before, I recommend this title solely on account of how different it is from the other games that are probably already in your collection. Ubongo is a brain-teaser that serves as a nice change of pace from cube pushers and resource management and exercises some spatial awareness muscles that might not be used to getting a work-out. I definitely think Ubongo has a place in large collections that get a lot of play.

That said, after a couple dozen plays, I can't say Ubongo has really separated itself from the various other "variety picks" we have on hand. Since we don't play games as often now, we're more likely to head straight for the "main course" or whatever game's captured our interest, and Ubongo is neither. Although I enjoy playing it, I somehow don't ever [i]want[/i] to play it beforehand; there's always something more alluring to pull off the shelf. This might be due in part because it sort of stretches the meaning of a "game"; I'd probably get about as much satisfaction out of racing someone in Sudoku, for example. and I pretty much never do that.

As such, Ubongo probably ends up in a drawer full of puzzles and other diversions, good for a rainy day. Of course, here in California, that's another thing that almost never happens...

Ubongo Duel is all about the puzzles and takes the gem rubbish (of the original) out of the game. This is a great improvement as the gems really were too random.

Now it is wit against wit. To mix up the action each player now has a plethora of odd shaped pieces at their disposal and each puzzle page offers 20 puzzles per side and there are 2 sides! In all there are 360 different puzzles and they feature 4 piece puzzles on one side and 5 piece puzzles on the other.

The final new twist is that in Duel, both players will be trying to complete the exact same puzzle with the exact same pieces - so this is true head to head action.

The puzzles are much more challenging than in standard Ubongo and both players can spend minutes rather than seconds trying to figure them out. This is good in my opinion, even if I can't beat my wife now!

The fun of playing easy puzzles at speed with more players in the traditional game is cast aside. Here we make the puzzles harder and longer and restrict the game to 2 players. You're left with a race to see who gets frustrated first as you manipulate those 5 little pieces for the umpteenth time into a different configuration and hope it luckily snaps into place before the other player. For some puzzles you can work out start pieces and build off that. But it's still a long way to go. You can try the easier 4 piece puzzles, but the race to see who's better on identical puzzles doesn't leave much room to blame luck in order to make it a friendly spouse game.

This game is very much multiplayer solitaire--both players are trying to solve the same puzzle, and the first player to do so gets a point.  That said, I do like the puzzles that are presented, but the game will be frustrating if there's a large disparity in spatial skills.  I've found the best way to solve these puzzles is to be methodical: put a piece somewhere, and then try every combination of the other pieces in the remaining spaces.

Good small portable box.  We like it more than original Ubongo.  This one's all about solving the puzzles in frantic real-time, with no lame tacked-on weird scoring stuff. Each player solves the exact same puzzle (same map, same pieces) as the other.

And the puzzles are harder (in a good way)!

On the downside, some tiles don't fit together easily (tab in slot too snug), and the black plastic insert has 2 spaces to hold the 2 bags of pieces but these spaces are a little too small - poorly designed. We're thinking of just ditching the black plastic insert.

Two Player Value = Excellent


The easiest and fastest way to describe Ubongo: Duel is to say this is the best puzzle I have played. And that is big praise because I have played some real gems.

The beauty of this game comes from its simplicity. It is simple yet elegant. Very basic board and components. Extremely minimal rules. But it offers big game play and big fun.

Essentially this is a head-to-head Tetris battle. Except the pieces are not random and not falling from the sky. The board and pieces are set each round. Players battle against each other to figure out the puzzle first. The first player to figure out 5 puzzles wins.

This game carries no theme. It is not needed. It is a straight puzzle game. Pure. Easy. Beautiful.

I will note this is my favorite version of Ubongo as well. This version is not cluttered with silly point systems. 

I will also note that while this is a two player game, it works fantastically with 4 players if you combine 2 sets. In my opinion, this is how Ubongo should be played. It is wonderful with 4 players. Playing this game with 4 players is much better then the original version.

FYI - Ubongo means brain in Swahili.

If you've played Daedalian Opus on the GameBoy, then you know everything you need to about Ubongo: Duel. It's a puzzle game where you're fitting Tetris-style pieces together to fill up a space, exactly. Do this before your opponent, and score a point. Score five points and win. Super easy; super stressful; super fun! I can't get enough of this game. Great 2-player experience.

Tangram puzzles adapted as a board game through speed-solving.

I decided to get this one for my first Ubongo title because both players solve the same puzzle, and that turned out to be a sound decision, as I enjoy how it makes the game really competitive and tense, plus a little collaboration later as the winner shows the loser how he put the puzzle together. I can't see how the game would be nearly as fun or interactive if you're off solving your own puzzle. I don't want to hear "your puzzle was easier" excuses when I kick ass. 

This game isn't really my cup of tea (spatial rotations), but I acquired it to fill a niche in my collection, and it worked out well, as my girlfriend likes it.

======================

A little tired of this game, as there appears to be a ceiling on how well you can do, before luck governs who solves first. My girlfriend still can't get enough of it though. And shouting "UBONGO!" is still one of the more satisfying experiences in gaming. Takes a different breed of gamer to like this game.

I fell in love with the Ubongo series on first playing Ebongo Extrem.  I picked up an import edition of this as a matter of course.  I really like it.  At the time, it was by far the most difficult of the products available.  Ubongo 3D certainly gives it a run for that title these days.

While I like the game, being a two-player only game limits my opportunities for playing.  However, the two-player only version allows for a reasonable scoring system that is absent from some of the other games in the series.  The other big problem with this as a two player only game is the lack of a timer.  While this can shorten the game, since you play to a score of five, my experience is that the game is often a little longer since you play until one of the duelists actually completes his puzzle.  However, one really big plus is the massive number of puzzles included (360).  A friend of mine joked about using a copy similar to the page-a-day calendars that are out there.  

All that said, it is still really good.  I rank it just below the top tier games, but ahead of the others. [01/08/2011]

Apparently you can only buy this version and Extreme through an overseas supplier. This version involves two players attempting to solve the exact same puzzle without a timer as determined by a 20-sided die roll.  Sometimes it can take you almost as long to solve one puzzle as the rest of other puzzles.  As with the other versions, too many non-symmetrical pieces can really slow the game down sometimes.  The scoring is rather straightforward, allowing two spaces for the second player to catch up.

It's Ubongo, except:
- both players are working on the same puzzle at once. The game includes 2 matched sets of 9 double-sided sheets, one side using 4 pieces and the the other using 5, with 20 puzzles per side. That's a lot of puzzles!
- there's no timer: take as long as you need to solve the puzzle!
- scoring is also simplified: the first to solve 5 puzzles wins. There's also a variant where, after solving 3 (I think), the leader must solve 2 puzzles while the other needs to do only one!
- these seem kind of hard!

Great game for two!

[Kosmos 08 edition] {Abstract, couple; puzzle-solving, simultaneous action, timed-turn, puzzle} The puzzles, unexpectedly, are more difficult than other Ubongo series.  It's fun and challenging! I like it!

The scoring variant is not useful, except making the game longer. I would play the usual scoring only.  If the difference is really large, I would rather handicap the better one (e.g. having him playing 15-20s later, or make the inferior one start at 2).

The components are nicely produced.  The cardboard tiles are study.  The figure are classic.  The scoring board is colorful and handy.  However, the black d20 die is dull.  The packing is good, too (nice box size).

This game is bananas!  The tetris/patchwork puzzles are very clever and tricky.  I'm amazed that each puzzle has 20 possible solutions.

A brainburner for 2 people. To be a duell game it really is. Fun but hard.

RATING: 6.5
Fun puzzle game, but differences in ability can really make this game uneven. The scoring mechanic can't really fix that. 

Can be played solitaire, or simultaneously solitaire (non-competitive). Good for kids who like puzzles.

RATING: 7.5
Puzzle, not game - very difficult for me!
It's great at developing the left side of the brain - I find I can solve them easier if I am not trying to think it through - just place the way it feels good.

Played twice. This game was pretty tough for both me and the other player. These puzzles seemed tougher than the ones in the standard Ubongo game. To even the game up between players of disparate skill levels, the designer put in a neat mechanism that makes it harder for the better player to run away with it. While the player mats are not of the best quality (I have the Kosmos version, which sounds like it's basically the same as the Z-man version), it seems of good enough quality to last a long time. Very nice addition to the Ubongo family.

Two-player variant from the Ubongo family.  Tough puzzles make for challenging play.

Ubongo - Das Duell is a great two-player twist on Z-Man’s puzzle-solving brain teaser. It’s nice to be pitted against your opponent on the same puzzle for once and it’s also nice to have a simple and rational scoring system for once, both things that are missing from other versions of Ubongo. It’s also a wonderfully small box so it fits perfectly on the shelf. Hopefully there will be a domestic printing of Das Duell eventually so you won’t have to import it or say the name with a bad German accent.

Thought I'd like this better than I do because I like spatial puzzles.  Have now taken Ubongo off my wishlist because it just didn't grab me.

It's fun speed-solving the puzzles, but there's no further game or interaction beyond that.

RATING: 7
I liked this quite a lot, but it certainly highlights differences in skill. My opponent found it pretty frustrating for that reason. I'm eager to find either a more evenly-matched opponent or one who doesn't mind handicapping. Otherwise this game may prove unsucessful for me, practically speaking.

Harderst version of Ubongos. 5 pieces are something not really for beginners.

If you've gotten too good at Ubongo, using these larger pieces and bigger boards provides a challenge, plus the fact that the two players are doing the same puzzle at the same time takes out all of the luck.  I recommend the fan-made boards found here on BGG.

A friend and I who were big fans of Princes of Florence used to do little competitions to see how we could fill up a player mat with such and such landscapes and/or buildings, sort of like a race to see who could figure out the puzzle first. Ubongo is basically that concept implemented into a game- brilliant! I'll have to pick up a copy of this and mail it to him..

Played a few times. A tougher and more challenging version of Ubongo, which I liked but found too easy. Now, this one is not. Some puzzles are really difficult and the game doesn't come down to whoever grabs the right pieces first anymore. Also, the scoring system is much simpler and better (not that I cared much for it when I played it). As for the third minor problem in the original game, it has been removed too, since players are solving the same problem at the same time. Overall, it is definitely my favorite version of Ubongo (although it might be slightly too difficult for people not inclined to play this kind of puzzles - but then, they would probably not enjoy it anyway).

This is so much cooler than I thought it would be. And my wife loves it as well. Sits on/ around our kitchen table so that we can bust it out when we have a quite half-an-hour. - The total number of plays is incorrect. We have played it a lot more than that.

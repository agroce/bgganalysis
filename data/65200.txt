I didn't know that instead of being a game, this wanted to be something else, a system to play a variation of games (involving space racing cars and asteroids, of course).

Might be cool for people who are creative and have fun inventing their own games. No fun for me, I'm uncreative.

An initial play of this led to a very tight game with some unanticipated shenanigans from both moving board elements as well as competitors. Very exciting, for certain... but missing something.

Rating is preliminary, but subsequent plays are necessary to determine how I really feel about this one.

Expected more but the experience was not enjoyable. One misplaced counter or inadvertantly nudging the player card can ruin your whole turn which is a flaw in the mechanics. Having a set time to make your moves may have been necessary (too easy otherwise) but added nothing. The best way to go is to deliberately smash into the asteroids...

RATING: 5
Quite a nice surprise, and a game that I think will work well with friends, although the artwork for the pilots may be a bit off-putting. I was a little underwhelmed on opening the box and reading the rules, however the basic race was good fun (one player complained of brain-hurtiness, but enjoyed it I think). My concerns about the game-play being fairly uninvolving disappeared as everyone moved the asteroids and swore profusely when the timer ran out, or at the inevitable wrong turns. Despite the little ships the components lend themselves well to (the encouraged) DIY changes and additions to the basic game - an option which has become more appealing now I have played. 

Not yet played, but the quality of the components is a mixed bag. Tiles are linen finish and made from good thick card. Player mats are much thinner card (and I'm not a fan of the art work or, for that matter, the completely superfluous pilot biogs). The plastic components are pretty cheap-looking, especially the ship tokens - I've had better trinkets out of a Christmas cracker.

I don't enjoy timed preprogramming games such as Robo Rally and Asteroyds has a number of elements that I don't enjoy. Planning your moves against a strict clock whilst trying to plan around the movement of asteroids that have small poorly defined icons. The whole thing felt like too much effort and I would even prefer to play Robo Rally over this.

See Colt Express on how to implement preprogramming well.

after reading the rules, I thought I had to deal with a very chaotic game, but after a few rounds the concept becomes clear. You have only 50" to see through the different moves of the asteroyds and that's enough. Just like in roborally you make a program but here you're not held back by unlucky cards. The game plays fast and after all it's fun and you have control. and euh... please do not make any faults, that could be fatal.

second play : nice game, but not the same enjoyment as roborally.

I love it but you should play with players of your level. That's the kind of game (speed thinking) that suits some players and doesn't suit others. And as there is no interaction at all, there is no way to counter power brains.

Rulebook is very disorganized, but still plays out as a fun fast pace racing game.  Reminds me of Robo Rally without the risk of not drawing the right cards.  

By turn 4 most of the asteroids were stuck on the borders edge.  Not sure if this was a one game fluke or trend without further plays.

A bit like RoboRally but the board elements are unpredictable. In this game the asteroids move AFTER you have programmed in your move. Not a bad game. Board doesn't lay flat which is hard with the asteroid hexes laying on top of that.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable (albeit somewhat chaotic) programmed movement race + speed game with similarities to Robo Rally.  The goal is to tag each of the relay points but unlike in R.R. you can tag them in any order... and they are moving targets!!!  Ship programming is a speed puzzle.  From the point at which you find out which way the asteroids will be moving (at the start of the turn), you have 30 seconds (sand timer) to program a few moves for your ship.  This makes the game speedy, stressful, and chaotic.  You need to figure out which way is clear of asteroids because your ship will be damaged if you hit them or they hit you (and your ship could blow up if it takes too much damage).  I like this game more than R.R. because it tends to be more fast, furious + stressful.

Others say and I agree:  Long setup, too chaotic/random & basic race game gets repetitive quickly.

Only played once oso far.  We enjoyed it and there's definitely some skill in it.  However, the luck of the dice affects things too.  I trailed far behind most of the game because the asteroyds all cleared out of her sector initially.  However, I ended up winning because the asteroyds eventually closed up the route she was going to take and she didn't have time to go all the way around the galaxy.  

Would definitely like to try it again but I'm not sure if it's a keeper

Comprado en pedido conjunto a Ludobay en Octubre de 2016, por 5€.

Es un juego de "programación". El juego básica consiste en una carrera en pasar a través de cuatro puertas. En una primera fase se tiran unos dados que determinan en qué dirección se van a mover los asteroids y después hay un tiempo (el juego viene con un cronómetro) para programar los movimientos de tu nave, de tal manera que la puedas conducir a través de las naves de asteroids hasta conseguir pasar por las cuatro puertas (que tambien se mueven como el resto de los asteroids).

Hay un modo de juego avanzado, en el que las naves además, pueden disparar.

Está muy sencillito y las partidas duran poquito. Es válido para gente no acostumbrada..

I expected to get a game with chaos and randomness... but I got a bucketload of "What the heck is happening?"
Taken for itself it is a small little filler where you try to race through a totally random board and you have to deal with it.
For me it is not what I expected...
The big turndown is the player elimination. In our first game we had three killed players and the last one won with just two portals crossed because the rest died so quickly.
I don't know if it gets another chance...we'll see.

Really enjoyable game, and it can be quite tricky with all of the moving asteroids.  I suspect that over time we'd get better and it would become more of an optimization problem rather than a game of survival.

A racing game sort of in the vein of RoboRally where players plan their moves and then see what happens.  The trick here is that you must navigate through a field of asteroids that don't like to stay put!

Before each turn, dice are rolled to determine the movement of the asteroids.  Then, with this knowledge, players plan their movements, trying to envision where the asteroids will be.  You must do this in 50 seconds or less (for beginners) which is not a lot of time!  Once the 50 seconds are up, the asteroids are moved and players move their ships.  More often than not, someone will have envisioned the asteroid movement incorrectly and they will slam into one, taking damage.  Take too much damage and you lose!

Basically, the game boils down to who is best at quickly deciphering where the asteroids will be, as the planning of movement itself really isn't very challenging.  It's just whether you chose the right path.  

There is also a lot of randomness when it comes to where the asteroids will move.  Some players will end up trapped, while others have a relatively easy route.  However, it's a quick game, so this didn't bother me too much.

Overall, I thought it was a neat, quick, but slightly brain-burny race game.  If you like the whole planned movement thing a la RoboRally, I think you'll like this one.  If you're not into that sort of thing, this will probably suck.

Asteroyds is a game very similar to RoboRally. However, to me (and I know I’m in the minority here), Asteroyds is probably the better game. It fixes my issues with RoboRally that RR is too long, requires 5-6+ players to be fun and that you can be screwed by the cards you are randomly dealt.

On the other hand there is more interaction in RoboRally, at least when playing with a lot of players. In Asteroyds there is none, as every player can occupy the same space, so your actions don’t depend on what the other players are doing. This means the game is a little solitaire and feels more like a puzzle on time – but this isn’t really a negative to me. And it certainly isn’t to my wife, who loved this game and requested that we played it again immediately afterwards. 

Personally I love the tension of the timer; without it there obviously wouldn’t be a game, at least not a fun game… It only takes like 20-30 minutes to play a scenario which is great. The rules even come with various scenarios and suggestions that you make up your own, even your own rules! We haven’t done so yet but will do in the future.

in contrast to RoboRally, this one gives you total planning freedom (you do not have to manage drawn cards), but makes the playing field much more chaotic. Good game, but misses the ram aspect of RR - and that is where most of the fun in RR comes from.

Asteroyds is one of the few "programmed movement" games I've played, the other being Space Alert. Where Space Alert is a complex pressure-filled and intense collaborative game experience, Asteroyds is lighter with relatively straightforward rules. Essentially, you're moving a ship around an asteroid field, those asteroyds are on hex-shaped tiles, and each hex side represents one side of a six-sided die. Roll the dice, anticipate where the asteroids will move, choose up to six movements for your ship, and then see how you screwed up once you actually move the asteroids. Every turn takes roughly 50 seconds on a timer.

This is probably a divisive game. Programmed movement is not for everyone. Some will love the time pressure and spacial planning, others will find it confusing or simply not fun. Cound me in for enjoying this style of game... I find it a fun challenge. I love watching your best intentions crumble as that one false turn bonks you into one asteroid after another. This is also a game that will have a learning curve. I imagine "seasoned pilots" will blow away newbies. Fortunately, there's scenarios that can balance out the disparity in experience. 

There's some nitpicks about the game--the "dual color" asteroids are hard to distinguish, and the pips on the asteroids can be hard to read. The little plastic ships aren't clear in what direction is "forward." Having said that, I think the game looks impressive when set up. There's also some unique benefits to this game--there's three different versions for playing out of the box, including team play, and it handles six players wonderfully. Our game group had a blast with this one, and it's been very well received.

I've only played the "race" format of this one. I found the rules to have a couple holes, but overall a pretty simple design.

I am surprised at how much diversity there is in peoples' ability to correctly calculate the path of the meteors. I think someone who isn't a natural at doing that will find this game very frustrating. The time element seems crucial to make the game work, but could also be a negative for some players. Personally, I think its just fine.

The set up time for this game seems out of proportion to the game length, but I still look forward to repeated plays.  Its nice that it scales up to 6 players.

The great thing about games that come with timers is the feeling of pressure they induce.  This makes the game feel tense and really gets your blood pumping as your racing the clock and the other players, and really have to think fast.  This game is more of a system in a box, with many modes of play, and endless possibilities for custom scenarios/modes.  In fact, the designers encourage it right in the manual.  Plays quickly and is easy to teach and learn.

Roborally-like game of programming your spaceship through fast moving asteroyds. Each turn, you know where the asteroyds are going, but there's a lot of them, they are all moving differently and you've only got limited time to programme. Actually much, much harder than Roborally which at least has a static board of obstacles. However this also results in a more complex and time consuming resolution of the programming. Requires fast and clear thinking and very good spatial perceptions. Due to the random asteroyd movement some players will get an easier run, but that's OK in a game which wont last more than 20 minutes.

Players are racing their spaceships through an asteroid field, trying to be the first to land on four gates.  Fun game where 3 dice are rolled to randomly move the red, blue and white asteroids around the hex map game board.  Players must program their ship's six movement steps for the turn before the asteroids actually move, so you have to mentally judge what is going to be where.  During movement, if a ship hits an asteroid, it takes damage and too much damage leads to elimination.  Fun game, very much in the Robo-Rally mould, but much much faster.  Several different play options too.

This game isn't for everyone (what game is? I suppose one might rejoin, but I mean it in a more prevalent sense), but I love the "program your move ahead of time" mechanics. I *don't* like this as much as I like RoboRally, but I still like it.

RATING: 7
Yes, I agree with similarities to Roborally. I am indignant with the statement, "this is a fun Roborally," because I think Roborally is a blast.

For me Asteroyds is a much harder game because you have to figure out the moves of the asteroids in your head, AND REMEMBER them, and mark your moves all within the short time frame suggested of 30 - 50 secs.  Both the asteroids and your space ship move. Also there is no recovery--once dead with your one ship, you are out of the game.

Whereas in RoboRally the time frame depends on the first person to finish their plans, and the obstacles/hazards are stationary, only your robot moves.

I usually don't like games with a hex-space layout, but this game incorporates it magnificently. 

I am especially appreciative of the included digital timer.  There are many games that should start including them to free the player for game concentration instead of fretting over timer watching.

I find games (such as Asteroyds) exciting and very re-playable when the setup can differ each time, and when players can construct their own scenarios.

Game time short, rules few and easy.  However had to look up some rules' clarifications about the Reserve Energy & Shield.  (In the race, only 8 of the 9 tokens are used which gives you 7 actions each turn, using your 7th token as either a shield or an extra move with Reserve Energy.)

This game comes with the rules for a few different games.  The Racing game (the only one I've played so far) is a lot like RoboRally in turns of the goals and how you move.  However, instead of machinery turning on and doing things, you have asteroids hurtling through space in small moves in various directions throughout the course of the game that serve as obstacles which must be avoided.  However, while the asteroids movements are determined through random dice rolls, the information is all open, and each player can figure out exactly where the asteroids will end up and how to move around them - except that the time pressure for each move makes processing all of that information difficult.  The goal is to be the first ship to fly through each of 4 target objects on the board, but the trick is that those targets are potentially moving on each turn as well.  The box says 20-40 minutes, but our first game was at least an hour with 5 players.  It`s also different from Robo Rally in that the move planning phase (done simultaneously) is under a strict timer (20-50 seconds per turn depending on desired difficulty level).  The timer provided with the game is actually an honest-to-goodness electronic kitchen timer with the Asteroyds logo printed on it.  
The board and asteroid tiles are very nice thick cardboard, but timer in its original `kitchen timer`packaging was slightly disappointing, and the markers used to show movement plans are just regular tiddley-wink-like pieces.  The spaceships are smaller than the box might lead you to believe.  The little artwork required for the game is great, if not a little scary for the very young.  

Player interaction in the racing game is almost non-existant since ships don`t actually interact with one another on the board (2 ships can occupy the same space).  However, there are Shooting and Drone game rules where the whole point is interacting with other ships.

Overall, I`m quite pleased with this game.  It`s good, light fun with straightforward rules that still requires a fair bit of planning.  I`ve had a blast playing with my children, who say they like it better than Robo Rally.

Asteroyds is a programming game. Players try to navigate their spaceships through an asteroid field under time pressure.

It's a very challenging job because you need to take three levels of asteroid movement into account when programming the up to seven steps of your flight path although if you're unsure/careful you don't have to use the maximum number of steps. It's also a rather solitary job out there in space because the actions of other players are of no consequence whatsoever (apart from someone reaching their goals faster than you). All in all, Asteroyds is a short adrenaline-fueled ride that lends itself quite well to scenario development (a team scenario is included, for example) and general customisation.

This game is fun in the way that Space Alert is fun. You have to program your actions under a timer without full knowledge of the movement of asteroids. then chaos happens It's a lot of fun, and playable in under an hour. I am told this is roborally in space that plays quicker, but I have not played roborally to verify that.

A simultaneous programming race game in a similar vein to Roborally but much faster playing.  I have enjoyed my few plays but don't seek future plays.  

It can get a little fiddly with all of the Asteroid movement involved, and shifting discs on your player aid, so I find that much of the game time is maintenance and upkeep rather then actual "playing".

I would play again, prefer it to Roborally, fairly average.

It does the speed planning pretty darn well.

The full knowledge of where the rocks will go adds enough challenge that it does feel like a game of skill.

However, there's really pretty much no player interaction.  Himalaya seems so much better with the solid give and take with the other players.

Also, the setup and physical process of moving everything detracts some from the fun.

Decent enough programmed-movement game in the Gunslinger/Roborally vein. There's a lot of space junk floating about - you have a choice of play fast and hope to get lucky or try to fathom out what all the stuff around you is going to do before you get to execute your move - and even then you can screw up royally (as I demonstrated).

This one can generate some brain strain which slows it down, but I prefer it to Roborally which I found really dragged and left you at the mercy of the cards you draw. 

I'm looking forward to playing Gunslinger, where you're trying to predict what they other players will do rather than  predict uncontrollable random elements.

With the right group, the frantic atmosphere and chaotic turn results can be a blast. You have to operate the timer on a sliding scale though - as people start to develop their sense of spatial awareness, decrease the time available for turn programming. While it's not fun to see anyone blow up, it's certainly a delight to all when players are so rushed that they end up spinning in a circle or missing their targets by a wide mile.

When a rulebook starts with a statement that this is a kind of gamekit where players are free to make up their own scenarios and rules, this usually is a warning sign for me that the authors are aware that the game could have needed more development or is lacking as a whole. Asteroyds wasn't able to prove me wrong.
What got me interested in first place, is the resemblance with two of my favourite games, Robo Rally and Ricochet Robots. As in Robo Rally, players  simultaneously program their moves. As in Ricochet Robots, this happens under time pressure as a timer ticks down. But contrary to these two games, gameplay is lacklustre. At first, the time pressure holds a lot of tension and seeing other players' mistakes lead to them crashing into asteroids is fun for a while. But the same procedure is repeated again and again. After a while, the asteroids tend to cluster together in a few corners of the board and just rushing straight ahead becomes common. At this stage, the game could have needed more development. I rarely see the need for house rules but here they could really improve the game and at least the designers were open in this concern.

RATING: 8
Aside from Himalaya, Roborally and Space Alert I haven't played too many programming games, and I've only played these a couple times.  So I'm a fan of the mechanism, especially when there's time pressure, as extended calculation ruins any game, especially lighthearted ones like Asteroyds.

I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but the artwork is fine and the theme is passable.  But it is pretty funny to see miscalculations and errors, even when you do it yourself.  Those that complain about chaos just aren't thinking hard/fast enough, because you can know exactly what's going to happen.  I guess if one player was way better at this type of spatial visualization, they should have a much easier time.

I also like that there is some breathing room in the system to add your own little touches to the game.  One thing I'd like to see (and surely most people must think this way) is some sort of combat variant or something to allow more interaction between players.

A final note about the production.  While it's not that big of a deal, it was disheartening to see that the RGG print run at least was made in China.  You can definitely feel the difference as you handle the box and punch out the pieces.  There was definitely no difference in price - if anything, Asteroyds seems overpriced for what you get.  I hope this is not a signal of a general shift in philosophy.

I have to admit, I did not expect a lot from this game going in, but it really surprised me! 

It has a lot of similar chaotic elements to Robo Rally, but in a more controlled fashion. Loosing due to Chaos in this game is more a fault of your own lack of foresight rather than purely from the board screwing you over, which is neat. 

The board can be a little too random sometimes, and it seems that asteroids that get clustered sometimes remain clustered for quite a time. Not a lot that can be done there, aside from like, a bouncing collision mechanic.

Overall, very fun game! Glad I picked it up!

A neatly executed race game with a timer to pace your movement programming, nothing wrong with it really. Cheap impulse buy, after trying it out I kinda feel that there has to be something else in a game beside just pure simultaneous programming for it to be really interesting to me (take for example Himalaya, which is great). Asteroyds works great for a quick filler, and should be easy to modify if you want to tinker with some variants for advanced weapons or other special fx.

When this first came out I was intrigued. Sci-fi theme, nice looking artwork. Then I read it was similar to RoboRally and lost hope -- although I love RR, few in my groups share that love. So I wanted to try it before I bought it. Problem is, to try it, someone would have to buy it, and no one ever did. After not seeing it at all at my second Unity Games event, I decided to bite the bullet and bought it -- and unopened copy, I might add -- from someone in the Marketplace.

There's some fun to be had here if you enjoy things like RoboRally and Galaxy Trucker, where part of the fun is when things go horribly wrong. But the rulebook is terrible. Some very basic things -- such as whether or not a ship ever enters the same hex as an asteroid -- aren't mentioned at all. And the fact that Nobody ever bought or played this game means there aren't many rules answers here on BGG.

There's also the fact that it's pretty brutal and has player elimination, so unfamiliarity with how things are going to play out in the game can result in simply watching the game, which is no fun. So it may need some house rules, like "lives" or something.

I'm still not sure about it, but after nailing down some rules, I'd like to give it another try. (Addendum: sold after realizing it would never hit the table again.)

I think this is a better, tenser game than Robo Rally. Whereas Robo Rally relies on chance to cause chaos, the movement in Asteroyds can be calculated precisely; the chaos comes from the difficulty players face in working out the movement of all the hazards. This also adds considerable tension, as the longer you spend calculating a safe path, the less time you have to program your actions.

Unfortunately, the components are a bit cheap and crappy, and you can tell right away that Ystari had this made in China, instead of by one of the quality German printers. The various bits are all serviceable, although you'll want to use your own kitchen timer, as the one included has buttons that are just a bit fiddly.

It's a programming game, similar to [thing=18]Roborally[/thing], but different because every obstacle in the board will move along with you.

It's a really neat idea that provides a good game.
-> The programming part is very short and tense. The administration (moving the obstacles) takes much more time and it becomes a bit taxing after a while.
-> The luck factor is much higher than in Roborally. If you find 2-3 asteroids in your path, you might lose 2-3 turns easily, while others might have all their path completely free of obstacles.
-> There's no real "risk factor". Taking risks here only allows you a 7th move action that won't make almost any difference. This Roborally handles that much better with the life points, the blocked cards, the reboot and the respawn.
-> Almost no interaction between players in the race mode (or the interaction is very random).

On the plus side, it's quite customizable. The rulebook already offers 2-3 game modes and you can easly improvise more to suit your own needs/likes.

It's a good game, but for me, Roborally covers this very same spot better.

RATING: 6
Building on the obvious foundation of RoboRally (there are more mechanisms borrowed than simply programmming moves under time pressure) but ditching its humour, most of its interaction and the rules overload, Asteroyds is actually a very elastic frame for different sorts of games mixing races and air combat. The common element in all the games is their very core (and name): dangerous asteroids drifting in a vast amount of space and obviously hitting any unfortunate vessel painfully hard.

From these premises it's more or less clear what follows: an intense and very chaotic game that pays off the lack of thematic spice with an insane amount of possible setups (let alone scenarios), a relatively short duration and a pristine way to adjust the difficulty level (a digital timer). Interaction gets totally lost when racing without gunshots, but managing to survive churns the stomach enough at first. Moving the asteroids every turn can be a bit fiddly but overall the pace is definitely faster than the average.

Robo Rally on (a)steroids. Under immense time pressure, you need to quickly determine where every single asteroid in your vicinity is going to move (5 different types of asteroids, each moving in a different direction per the dice rolled at start of turn, moving a different number of spaces, some pushing, some not) and then program a series of straight aheads, lefts and rights to negotiate a safe path towards the next gate you need to get to (get to all 4 first to win). Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's hard, but the pressure is fun. And if it gets too easy, reduce the time allowed. There's too much to set it up, and a bit fiddly each turn moving all the asteroids before you move your rockets, but everyone pitches in and it goes pretty fast once you've done it a few times. And there's any number of variants you can play if you're done with the standard race game, including shoot 'em ups. My only reservation is that experienced players will dominate, but you can overcome this by having two different time restrictions in place. The standard game is over in 5 or 6 turns once you get cracking, say 20 mins or so. Good fun, but for time pressure fast-board-assessment junkies only.

I really liked the [i]idea[/i] of preprogramming my moves, and the dice-generated asteroid paths seemed very clever.  But there is a lot to anticipate on each move, and I always seem to miss something.  Maybe I need to try it earlier in the day.

The idea is great and the mechanisms for programming your movement seem clever. Yet, when I play I don't get the feeling of excitement I would expect. In both games the asteroids bunched up and the ending became a bit anti-climactic even if close. Only tried one mode. Maybe the others could be more interesting.

Really neat "movement programming" game with a lot of chaos. Planning your moves right is really important, and the asteroids have a way to block your movement at the worst time, or so it would appear. I kind of think this is a lot more fun than Roborally. I will have to try the other modes and see how they pan out.

Chaotic and challenging. The way the 'physics' of the asteroids is implemented with regards to collisions is what makes this quite difficult to calculate (and hilarious fun when your ship, or someone else's, crashes. Comes with a few different modes to play, though the original race is the one I've found the most fun.

Hatan lehet vele játszani, ami külön jópont! 
Egy race játék, az fog győzni, aki leghamarabb átjut a negyedik csillagkapun. az egész a gyorsaságon és a tervezésen múlik. Mindenkinek meg kell tervezni a lépéseit kevesebb, mint egy perc alatt. ami a nehézség, hogy minden az űrben lévő objektum (hold, csillag, aszteroida és persze a csillagkapuk is) mozognak mielőtt az űrhajókkal lépnénk. és persze kölcsönhatást gyakorolnak egymásra, hol így, hol úgy.
Egy gyors játék, persze szerencse is kell hozzá, de aki jól tud megtervezni 6-7 lépést úgy előre, hogy minden más mozogni fog közben, az nyerhet úgy is.

In comparison to RoboRally:

* Plays much faster
* Easier and more accessible: there's only 5-6 actions to pick from, and you can pick from all of them
* I'm not sure about replayability. Because it's a puzzle ganm, players don't interact much with each other, and therefore the puzzle presented to each of the players should be as varied as possible. Yes, Asteroyds comes with several scenarios to vary the game, but I believe the core puzzle of RoboRally offers more variety than Asteroyds. 

However, I'm not much of a fan of RoboRally because it's simply a fiddly puzzle game, and I don't care much for games of that genre. However, Asteroyds (I believe) comes with scenarios that involve attacking your opponents, which might make it a more interesting game.

Roborally in space. 
Dice are rolled which inform you exactly where all the asteroyds will move on the board. However, against the short timer the panic of trying to plan your ships moves to reach flag points based on this movement info is a real stress.
If Roborally woeks for you then there's no reason this won't too.

This is a programing game that is under extreme pressure with the time limit.   Fun because there just isn't enough time to analyze all the angles so maybe you just push your luck an go for a guess or stay conservative and only move a little each turn.  the game mechanics are quite easy to grasp but there is a ton of re-playability because of the different missions and variable set up so each game is different.  Quick enough that you can play multiple times in a night.  Just a fun intense programing game .

 Moving the asteroids gets a bit fiddly and through the game they seem to tend to drift into the corners and become less relevant, but I enjoyed this as a novel twist on the fast, filler race game category.

Surprisingly underrated!

The 20-second timer to program your move while anticipating where asteroids will end up being located is a thrill! Often leads to hilarious mistakes!

Planning and movement is executed simultaneously so no downtime and accommodates the full compliment of six players with ease, which is a rarity.

Minor quibbles - (1) moving the asteroids every round is finicky and some movements are missed, (2) the "left" and "right" turning should have been shown as "counter-clockwise" or "clockwise" because it constantly confused players, (3) rulebook is vague on some specifications that we had to "fill-in-the-gaps" while playing.

Aside from these minor quibbles, this is one of the best *light* programming games out there. Plays the fastest too!

Asteroyds -- 

The game began in chaos — all mobile obstacles were positioned such that they would indeed move. However, once some clusters formed, planning became more manageable.

The mixed-color obstacles gave me some trouble. For example, a white-blue asteroid will move twice, once according to the white die, and once again according to the blue die. But since blue is the visually dominant color, I often overlooked the presence of white on the asteroid, and planned only for the blue movement.

The game is decidedly fiddly, as each mobile object must be checked for movement each turn — the mixed-color objects more than once.

Once the initial madness resolved itself into clusters, I found I could more quickly determine which variables pertained to my immediate plans. Then it was a race against the clock to see what I could accomplish in the zone whose movements I had plotted. I found the time-limited planning phase rather fun.

Definitely an enjoyable new take on the pre-programmed-moves and race-to-checkpoints genres, but I feel no need to own this.

1 play, basic rules, 5er.

A fun, quick, programmed-move race game with moving targets! Not for the spatially challenged! No player-interaction in the base game, especially since each is free to touch the rally points in any order they choose (so they will all head off in different directions). Although more interactive variants should be easy enough to implement if you like, for me it works great as is -- no one shooting at you, simply you racing against the clock to figure out how to program your movement. 

The board is set up with 4 target hexes in the corners, immovable objects in the center, and red/white/blue asteroid hexes (some are both white and colored) semi-randomly placed. Players start in the center, facing one of the 2 short edges of the board. Each turn is timed (we played 40sec), starting after the red/white/blue d6 are rolled. Players then program up to 8 steps of movement on their play mats (or 7 plus a shield). Next, move the asteroids/targets in the direction indicated by the d6 (all are marked 1-6 on each edge). Red moves first, 2 spaces; then white, 1 space; if target hex is occupied already, asteroid doesn't move (but if occupied by player, inflicts damage unless shield is up). Finally, blue moves 1 space but will push up to one (movable) asteroid if necessary. Then players move their ships according to their program (straight, turn left/move, turn right/move, reverse direction). If they hit asteroid, take 1 damage if shield up, 2 if not; or take 4 and destroy asteroid (6 damage destroys player ship) -- no further movement. If hit target, no damage (or if target moves onto ship hex earlier), take a token matching that target. The first player to collect one of each token wins the game!

There are also several variant/advanced rules (e.g., special player powers, different races, etc.).

One of the worst attempts at a race game I have ever seen.  The game is really only worth buying for the absolutely hilarious Engrish instructions on the timer packaging.  I guarantee you you will have more fun with that than the game.

The gameplay revolves around selecting a bunch of moves and then executing them like RoboRally.  All the time, you will have to dodge asteroids that you will know where they will move to, but you won't actually move them until after you finish programming.  The game is so simple it's boring.  Either you get a ton of asteroids in your way and can't do anything about it, or they'll all blast away into the corners and leave you a clear path to your destination.  Neither outcome is very interesting.

Fulfills the RoboRally promise of chaotic pre-programmed fun in an acceptable time. Part of that is just the pressure of having a timer from the start -- RR would also work better with the Asteroyds timer -- but the movement phase also happens much faster.

Moving the asteroids can be troublesome and the ships are quite hard to see; I also had quite a bit of trouble with the rulebook.

Still, fast and fun.

RATING: N/A
Just okay. I guess. Thematically weird in that the asteroids don't move in a straight line -- they dance around. Does that matter? I guess not. Maybe the theme could have been that you were a waiter trying to deliver drinks in a mosh pit? There's no real strategy you can apply to this game. Is "think quickly" a strategy? It's really the only "strategy" you can utilize here. All the information you need to make the best move is right there in front of you. In Roborally, there is the possibility that you will crash into other players. You also may not have the right cards. In Asteroyds you have complete knowledge of the situation and complete control of your ship. That doesn't necessarily make the game better or worse. But it's important to know that if you're not the kind of gamer who can think quickly, you're going to do very poorly in this game.

Normál emberi lényeknek nem ajánlott, csak zseniknek, matematikusoknak. Ez nem játék, hanem kínzóeszköz. Olyan fokú koncentrációt igényel, amire véleményem szerint kevés ember képes a Földön. Tervezz útvonalat, de úgy, hogy közben számold ki, hogy a sok aszteroida merre fog mozogni, aszerint, hogy a többszínű kockák(!) éppen mit mutatnak és persze a játékostársakról se feledkezz meg. Ja, és mindez időre ám! Képtelen. A csapatból egy embert leszámítva, aki matematika tanár, mindenki bedobta a törölközőt és csak vakon tippelgetett, pedig nem tegnap óta foglalkozunk gémer játékokkal...

I only got one play of this, and my group just didn't really enjoy it. It was even referred to as "That stupid asteroids game" the following week. I bought it because it was new, and was supposed to be like RoboRally... but it's even more chaotic, and nearly impossible to plan your route, since the asteroids move randomly each turn. In RoboRally, you can at least plan ahead, and take advantage of the game board elements. When your best laid plans fall apart due to getting pushed, it's a laugh. This game just felt random.

Rating after one game with two players. So far, I like it! As far as I am concerned it is better than Robo Rally, because: (1) it plays much faster (in terms of both downtime and total playing time - even when compared to the simplest RR maze layouts), (2) your moves are not confined to the cards that you happen to draw each turn. Some people commented on the low quality components, but except for the player boards (which are really thin), I do not have the same concerns. The bookkeeping is quite acceptable when you divide the board up so each player can move part of the asteroids each turn.

This is the programming fun of [thing=18][/thing], made more challenging.  Not only are you on a short timer to program your turn, you don't have the luxury of holding only 5 pieces of information (with embellishments) in your mind while you program.  No, you have to program fully 7 steps, while keeping in mind three stages of asteroid movement, based on the values of three different dice... and the directions are different for each asteroid.  This is pretty harsh, but I like it.  Unfortunately, the cool style of ship design results in bleah ship pawns that indicate their orientation poorly.  I look forward to taking the [thing=65200][/thing] challenge again!

The bastard offspring of Roborally & Powerboats.

Due to the hex map, and movement options your spaceship is able sweep through the asteroid field much more smoothly, quickly, and fluidly than in either of those aforementioned games.

When it comes to the asteroid movement, the directions are calculated before the round starts, so there is no luck involved as to their paths, only spatial awareness of their routes.

It doesn't take long to learn & read where the asteroids are moving to, and for safety you 'mostly' only need to concentrate on your finishing destination. The trouble is you are up against a strict time limit, in which to perform your ships manoeuvring sequence.

There is a bit of downtime when you actually move the asteroid field. During this period your ship can sometimes take minor damage from the ever changing playfield. Therefore you are always engaged in some fashion.

The hex board and the dice are pretty large as opposed to the smallish player pieces which unfortunately could have been a lot chunkier.

Limitless options for creating your own scenarios/layouts.

As far as programming games go, this is one of the best ones (not that there are THAT many). I certainly enjoy this better than Roborally (which also has the time pressure element) and Dragon Delta (which does not). The theme is well integrated and appeals to me. The components are well done, for the most part (the double color asteroids could have been labeled more clearly, and that clock is a disaster - I mean, you can't turn it OFF?!). One of my favorite aspects about it is that it doesn't overstay its welcome, which I always felt Roborally did. If the time-pressure, puzzle-solving aspect appeals to you, look into it.

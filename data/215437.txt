GAME: Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Core Set
RANK: 3048
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[I]tl;dr - Codex has the unfortunate distinction of being a good game that's exactly the opposite of what I tend to seek out: two-player-only wizard duel with a large metagame and steep learning curve.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Nothing against Codex, but two-player games like this are not for me. I'm not sure what to call them (the actual genre spans everything from deck-builders, to dudes on a map, to miniature games), but the general concept is a two-player duel game, usually with a lot of custom cards or fine-tuning that needs to be done to the deck/faction to make it playable. Other games in this vein would be Ashes or Arena of the Planeswalkers.

They may be fine games, but just aren't for me. For one, I value the accessibility of a game that doesn't make you build your own faction (though I recognize the richness of a game allowing you to do so). And for two, I just don't have a regular opponent for these types of games. 

I will say that Codex has some interesting ideas. The 'front lines' mechanic where you can place troops and gain special powers is interesting. Additionally, the buildings you can build are pretty cool as well. And as a final point in its favor, Codex does offer some pretty sweet prebuilt decks (or codexes), so much like SmashUp you could play competitively once you learn the various factions, without a need for deck-building creation (such as Ashes). That said, it's still two-player-only, it's still a deck-builder, and it's still one of those 'wizard duel' style games that I just don't find compelling.

Red/Green, plus tokens, counters, etc. See Deluxe Set listing for my thoughts on a whole. I like red as a destruction type faction, but dinosaurs in green is pretty intriguing.

A very good card game, where obviously a lot of work has been put.

A solid economy engine and absence of reactions make this totally perfect for my taste.

I am a fan of card games and this is one of my top 'want to explore' card game.

I typically love Sirlin game designs, but this was just too much. The deck building aspect is incredibly fascinating, but having an entire binder to filter through is overwhelming for a new player. Unless you're intimately familiar with all the cards in your binder the game can drag as you flip through and try to figure out exactly what cards to grab every turn.

Awesome card game with a unique deck-building system: you take your card from your codex (or binder with your colour cards). A bit MTG, a bit tactical combat, a bit Dominion, but unique, great and very strategic. Love it

Premium Edition - well worth the money!

This is a complete game, balanced from the start. As such, the focus is on your game skillz rather than how well you keep up with the meta game etc. 

Mechanically, it works great. For extra crazy fun, play it on Tabletopia: then you're playing a card game simulation of a RTS video game on a virtual tabletop

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

Sirlin's stuff generally doesn't work for me and while there's a little bit of his trademark overwroughtness here, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. It's pretty tight, though there are some loose screws (such as the amount you draw being based on the amount you discard, which if nothing else, is an irritating thing to remember to track). If you're looking for a Magic-in-a-box game, this will do nicely.

This game is pretty amazing. It is a unique twist to deck-building. I like the teching of building to get more powerful cards. The different factions feel very different and play synergistic.

Fun, but so much rules baggage.

Okay, more detail: The "teching" mechanism (add two cards to your discard pile at the end of every turn; the adding is free and mandatory, though cards also have costs when played that you need to balance) is the best version I've seen so far of deck construction inside a game. Like, that's where Dominion started and Dominion is brilliant, but the fact that you *buy* your cards, as genius as it is, also moves it one solid step away from the sealed deck Magic games that inspired it; it brings in so much of what's fun about deck construction games (e.g. Magic, LCGs) without the fun-ruining choice between spending non-game time building decks (sorry, not gonna, I have other games to play) and playing decks someone else built (fun sometimes but then what's the point?).. This stays pretty close to "real" deck construction while still having that construction happen during the game in response to gameplay, rather than beforehand.

BUT.

As with all Sirlin games, you have to take on nearly all the rules complexity right away, and if you're not going to play 10 times it's not clear if it's worth playing twice.

I think probably I prefer this sprawl to the compactness and number-crunchiness of Yomi but who knows.

Only play the basic version, Bashing and Finesse heroes, online.

Really decent, lots of varieties with only a few sets of cards.
Although I don't feel the secretly-two-card-adding mechanic is that great, it still works well enough.

In general, the game of Codex is similar to that of a typical LCG or CCG, sharing some common problem of this type(deep learning curve, static playing style .etc ), but it accomplishes basically the same thing with fewer cards and simpler rules.

This comes with some provisos.

I've always looked kindly upon David Sirlin's "cribbing" of other games. He seemed to be doing it to make significant alterations or expand upon the original premise, and not to take shortcuts in his designs. It also turned out that I liked a lot of his games far more than the original design he borrowed, so it seemed like a pretty worthwhile endeavor.

With Codex, I'm not so sure.

As can be seen from my comments, I really like MtG, business model notwithstanding. I also respect the designers for being able to maintain such a high complexity game, and to make sure that there are iron clad rules to back it up. You can teach yourself the rules in order to make sure that your interpretations are in line with the designers', and can leverage that knowledge to improve your own play. This is all supported by a supremely well written, consistent, and comprehensive rulebook.

Sirlin seems to have missed this when he redesigned Codex. The mechanics are in many cases lifted wholesale from Magic. There is haste, trample, flying, hexproof, etc. This leads to complex board states (a plus in my books), and interesting decisions where you can come up with interactions that your opponent hadn't planned for.

Unfortunately, the rulebook, and underlying rules structure, is an absolute train wreck. Two games in, and you will be frantically googling mid turn in order to find out if the ability you are relying on actually works the way you think it does. Not only that, but the rulebook layout is a tragedy of greek proportions, with far too much focus on teaching the game, instead of being at all equipped to quickly facilitate rules questions being answered.

It's not all doom and gloom though. The game manages to make some good fun out of its DOTA meets MtG meets Warcraft/Starcraft premise. Games can be exceedingly tense, and the idea of a "build" runs through all of your decisions as you play. You can tech up, but only if you can spare the money to make the leap.

The idea of momentum and force expenditure runs through the whole game. You can make big pushes, but they are almost always followed by a lengthy recuperation period. It's weighing the timing of those periods and the damage you will do to your opponent that makes the game.

In all, this isn't my favorite Sirlin game. I've barely scratched the surface, to be sure, but I don't know how much time I'm willing to devote to plumbing the depths. It relies on a solid opponent who also wants to strategize and come up with builds and counter-builds. One-off games of Codex would rate at around a 4 or 5 with me, if only due to the length of the game increasing drastically for new players. I'll likely keep it around, but I'm going to be on a try-before-I-buy policy for Sirlin games from now on. Between this and Pandante, I'm wondering if he's started to veer too far out from his fighting game roots.

Sleeved in Fantasy Flight clears.

This turned out to be as much fun as I'd hoped. I've only tried the limited single-hero intro so far, but even the single hero version gives me exactly what I was looking for in an MtG-style game. There are no planned expansions, so no balance-upsetting "required" content to keep up with. I was put off by the $200+ "deluxe" price tag, and the RTS theme still seems silly, but the core set turned out to be a great value.

I have been looking for a game like this aa couple of years.
I imvested in Summoner wars but despite that it was good it was missing something significant.
My friends really like ascension , hate star realms btw but both games are significqntly easier than Codex.

I have no background in magic but trying to write down my thought on codex I can understand why that was such a monepit.
I got the deluxe versions n so basicly i am all set until version 2 comes out.

Allthough i don't mind playing this copy in ten uears time.

It is exactly what i was looking for.
I have to get some terminology down but once you get that The game itself is pretty easy to play.
This doesn't mean that there isn't a learning curve.
It is a big one so the downside to this game is that you need equally skilled opponents like in all two player games...

 hoosing your direction when building your tech2  is what makes this a great game instead of a really good one.

Sirlin certainly borrows liberally from others, but the end result is something pretty awesome. Magic re-imagined as a RTS game (in card form). Deck-building and resource-management melded perfectly.

It grew on me. Somehow, strangely, I feel like I wanted to dislike this one. Maybe it was the sub-par art (very subjective), maybe something I *thought* I disliked... but no. It's actually great. Maybe even fantastic. I'm just now ready to start using 3 heroes and different factions after around 12 games with the starter set alone (and maybe 2 games with this core set). A must-try.

An interesting, 2-sided, press-your-luck and bluff game.  It really makes you think (and group think) in a different way.  Maybe a little long, but it kinda needs to be to combat all the randomness.  Makes me want to play [b]Auf Teufel Komm Raus[/b] more.

I was looking forward to rolling the barrel dice... and those barrel dice are nice. However, this is one of those super highly random games where it's not as much about calculating odds as it is about second-guessing others. I'm not totally against the idea of second-guessing, but it definitely requires the right group and it needs a game that sets up interesting second-guessing situations. In my one play, neither of those requirements was met. Could it be okay if I had the right group? Maybe. I'm not sure the game will set up those interesting situations though. For me, this was just too high on the scale of "I have way too little impact on what is happening here." And... I'm someone who can enjoy a game of Love Letter or Pairs or Incan Gold or No Thanks! The difference is that those games give me more opportunities to put odds in my favor. In Polterfass, I felt like it was 98% second-guessing and lucky dice rolls. It's just not for me... but I like the theme.

Un push your luck con faroleo muy divertido y rápido de jugar. En lugar de dados trae una especie de barriles con numeros en ambos extremos y que suman 11. 
Después de muchísimas partidas he de admitir que fue un acierto el comprarlo :)

Seems like this would be a really fine drinking game, maybe to be played at a bar.  Otherwise, it's a fine but unexceptional bluffing/blind bidding game.  I don't really feel a need to own it or even play it again, but there's nothing particularly wrong with it either.

Players are customers at a tavern, attempting to get the most drinks, without becoming too greedy!

During a round, one player is the barman and rolls the barrel dice (basically, barrels, with a result on the top and bottom!) onto their coaster.  Any standing barrels are set aside.  Each other player, the customers, then play a card or two face down representing their drinks order.  The barman may then keep rolling, or stop and serve the drinks.  When serving, if the barrel total exceeds the order total, everyone scores their order with the barman scoring the balance.  If the barrel total is under the order total, the barman scores the entire total, and the greediest player pays their order total to the least greediest.  Finally, if the barman doesn't roll a standing barrel, they fail and score zero, and every customer scores their order.  First to reach 75 points wins the game.

Nice little die roller, a little much ado about nothing, but mildly diverting as a game.  As usual for a Zoch game, this is very nicely produced with bar coasters, great barrel "dice", and a nice tumbler cup.

Polterfass pits the luck-pushing intuition of the innkeeper against the bluffing prowess of the guests. Neither side has a lot to base their moves on so it often resembles a pure double-think game. Just when you think you've figured them out, however, the "dice" don't play along. Fun.

This game is certainly unique. Little wooden barrels are essentially two-sided dice, but you have to make sure they're standing. I like how you are betting and trying to read the person who is the innkeeper each round. Good components as to be expected from Zoch. Fun with the right crowd.

Polterfass describes tight tension bewteen the host and the guests. Trust the host or not is very important. The tension is maintained by wagering. The system automatically makes high risk and high return. This kind of Press Your Luck mechanism reminds me the classic game, Cloud 9, a lot. Because of card mechanism, the host of Cloud 9 has more advantages than that of Polterfass. Comparing with Cloud 9, therefore, Polterfass provides more daynamic and dramatic game progression than Cloud 9. Either one is fine.

Polterfass is a quick, fun little dice game.  Being the innkeeper is the best part, but being a guest isn't so bad since you do have a wager in the final outcome.  As the innkeeper, there is slight strategy.  Pushing your luck can net you more points, but stopping after the first roll may result in getting more greedy guests.  Good game with really neat little barrel dice.

Push your luck type of a game that oddly has a scoring system that doesn't encourage pushing your luck. It sucks that guests are taking all the cards back to their hands after each turn.

Cute Zoch game which involves shaking a bunch of small barrels (of beer, in theory) in the cup.  Players bid with cards, and the barrel shaker has to decide how to keep shaking, or not, in order to get the most score.

I was a natural!

Nice activity, but not too much here for me.

Dice rolling, betting, and push your luck. I might be wrong, but the innkeeper seems to consider it more advantageous not to push his/her luck after the first roll. On second thought, it might be the the problem my group. Polterfass is an enjoyable game for sure, but not as excitingly fun as I expected. Also, the score keeping is a rather tiresome task.

RATING: 7
This is a weird little "dice" game where instead of polygons you're rolling wooden barrels with numbers on the end (only the ones that stand up count, and the fact that they're not easy to get standing up is key). One player is doing the barrel-rolling and the others are ordering drinks. How their orders compare to what's rolled determine who gets points and how many. So this is a push-your-luck sort-of-dice game in which everyone is invested in what's going on each round, and that's nice. With three players we did okay, but I think it works better with four.

[b]Mostly luck and bluffing - which wouldn't be bad per se, but in combination with all the adding up orders and dice results there's a lot of addition and score keeping for such a light game. In addition, the numbers 5 and 2 are difficult to tell apart (both on the dice and the cards), which adds confusion. The components are cute, but that doesn't quite salvage it as a game. I'd play it again, but don't like it enough to keep it.[/b]

Sounded more fun that it was. Rolling barrels instead of dice. Simultaneous bidding for how many pints you want without knowing how much the barrels will produce.

RATING: 7
Push-your-luck with nice beer barrel components which players shake up in a cup. It's the barrels that are standing up after the roll that count.  What's neat is after your first roll, players place bids. Players are trying to determine if the roller might bust and if not then what the total value may be. There's group think and points are scored depending on if the group bids over or under the bid. If you're the highest bidder you'll gain more points if the group bid is under the value, but if the group bid is over the value you'll lose points. What's great about this is that every player is playing every round unlike most press-your-luck games where players are taking turns, rolling for themselves.

Even though we are usually the target group for this niche of dice games, the scoring scheme made very little sense to us. I might be willing to try this once more to confirm the opinion, though.

The dice cup is also too small: The barrels just end up in a pile every time, instead of landing on the coaster.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i[]I'll probably play this again, but every time I play I can't help feeling that the game lasts way too long. ALso when you play with large groups (my games have been 6+ players) you may only get to be the barkeeper once and that is the most fun part of the game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Average push your luck games that benefits from a great theme and enjoying some libations while playing. After two plays I think the game tends to outstay it's welcome for what it offers. I'd play it again, but personally wouldn't seek it out. I'd much rather play something like Liar's Dice instead of Polterfass.[/i]

Lots of double-thinking, bluffing, trying to read other players - mixed with blind bidding and a push your luck mechanic. Plus, you get to roll barrels, which works very well.  The less barrels you have to roll the less likely there are any that will stand up - which is cool.

Highly recommended.

This is a fun romp and every turn is a crap shoot. I really think so. When starting with this game we all thought there was information to be derived form both the initial roll of the active player and the amount of cards the other players put down. Gradually we came to the conclusion that neither of those things give you enough information to make a good move to ensure you will win. It's a luck fest. And it's OK at being a luck fest, but I'd much rather play [thing=117663][/thing].

We had an absolute blast playing Polterfass! There's a wonderful scope for bluffing and guessing in the bids and in the dice rolling, complete with a little push your luck (and lack of control) in what you offer too.

Zoch continue to make interesting, charming and utterly distinct games. I expect to see this in my collection pretty soon.

There's nothing really wrong with this game, but it's not something that inspires a lot of repeat playings.  The "dice" are interesting, but not enough for me to consider this a dice game, or even be interested in them enough to want to get the game to add the dice to my collection.  It's a fairly basic press-your-luck game with an odd economic system that's hard to grok from the start of the game (or at least it was hard for me to remember it).  It's just ... meh.

This is a great little greed, push-your-luck filler that has been a lot of fun with my gaming group. First, I love the barrels-as-dice and the beer coasters, it fits the theme perfectly. I also like how there's several things going on at once: you (as the innkeeper) can bluff to the other players by acting like you're going to continue rolling the dice (or not) and if you do keep rolling, you're now playing a push-your-luck game. Meanwhile the other players (patrons) are trying to figure out how greedy they should be. Great little game, but I'll need to figure out a scoresheet replacement at some point.

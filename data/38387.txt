Ah, Knizia and die.  What a good fit for another retread of Schotten Totten!  I dug it and it will be played even more...

RATING: 5
1st play: Battle Line the dice game essentially.  I quite liked it, as it keeps some of the same tough decisions as the card game but without the shuffling.  Seems like it would be hard to find, but pretty easy to PnP.

2nd play: Much like Battle line I like it just fine, it's a decent 2 player filler but not something I'd seek out.  I do like how the dice simulate some of the same tough decisions as the card game but in a shorter playtime.  The hierarchy of hands is a bit less intuitive tho.

Must lighter and faster, but still enjoyable.
Battle Line is still superior, however.

This is perhaps my single most-played game, primarily because it is the ultimate restaurant game.

Quick, fun, food-proof and takes very little table space.  Plus my wife and I love dice.

Cobbled together my own version with 10mm dice, markered pennies and a dice bag.  Fits in my pocket and is always in my car.

A fun game. The entire mechanic of rolling the dice of different colours is quite good. THere is a fair bit of luck involved, but not too much for such a short game.

Battle line with dice. Simple and fun, a bit random but a bit challenging. Doesn't outstay it's welcome

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid game with simple gameplay.  Luck plays a big factor, obviously, since this is a dice game.  The luck becomes more significant at the end when there are fewer options for placement.  Unfortunately, this is also when the game is typically decided, so luck can easily swing a game over the final few tiles.

Like everyone else says, this is "Battle Line - The Dice Game".  You're trying to form combos on your side of various battles that beat the combos of your opponent, and this is done by drawing dice from a bag, rolling them, and then placing them.

There's a little less tension due to the "deck" of dice not being perfect information, and of course a lot more randomness in this game, but it's still a fun, short, two player filler.

Pretty good game. Bought blind at Unkas' leaving Australia auction. Worth what I paid even just for the bag of lovely dice. The game is very luck dependent and seems to have a run away leader issue most of the time but I have finally had a close game- the first four were almost entirely skunkings.

A classic at my home.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]**Battle Line con dados y con mas combinaciones, al que le guste no se cansará de jugarlo.

Siempre quiero jugarlo. Junto con el Genesis y Can´t Stop los mejores juegos de dados que he probado. Tras numerosos juegos, puedo decir que es un magnífico y que es el mejor juego dados que se pueda recomendar a grosso modo, y eso que esperaba un juego malillo de Knizia.

Definitivamente este juego es casi un espejo al Battle Line en forma de dados, cambiando un poco de azar (calculado a la perfección) por una mayor rejugabilidad si cabe, y una mayor tensión (grandes finales) y más jugadas disponibles que salen más a menudo. El diseño del juego es impecable, estoy a la espera de que salga la versión multijugador, que tarde o temprano aparecerá.[/COLOR]

Dice rolling version of Knizia's Battleline/Schotten Totten.  So once again Knizia takes an older game and remakes it.  That said, this is the version I like best because it's over fast and doesn't wear out its welcome.  AP is kept to a minimum.

A good attempt at converting Schotten-Totten into a dice game. It does work mechanically but it doesn't have any of the tension that the card game has. Also the box is way too big for what it needs to be. Not a bad game, just not what I was expecting of it.

Battle Line with dice... I suppose. But this has merely a fraction of the strategy. I'm not sure if it's the dice, or the fact that according to the rules you are only competing on four lines at once, but your choices seem obvious throughout. In Battle Line you have a set deck of values, so committing a card can be agonizing. With dice, all possibilities remain open and you are simply hoping for a good roll. Maybe being able to add dice to more lines at a time would improve things a little? I doubt it. I suspect the fewer rows are to compensate for the openness of the values, but it doesn't help.

The comparison with Battle Line/Schotten Totten is inevitable.  The play time is about the same, maybe a little bit quicker.  There's more of a luck element and the strategy here is more simple.  But it's still fun, a nice change of pace from the card game version and a lot of fun.  I know there are some that don't like all these Knizia retreads but this one is quite a bit of fun.

Presents the same kind of probability management as Schotten-Totten, but with only four places to put stuff instead of nine (did someone read an article on the rule of seven, or something?). Although the dice rolling is more inherently random than card drawing, it serves the same function. Simpler, but faster, but simpler.

I don't think I'll be raising the rating for this. It just feels very random compared to S-T.

Yes, this really is Schotten Totten/Battle Line with dice = more luck, less control. But in a same time Los Banditos is faster and even more filler kind of game than those other games mentioned earlier. So, fun every now and then, nothing spectacular fantastic but it hasn't to be.

RATING: 6.5
I prefer Battle Line/Schotten Totten over this one but it's a fun and very short diversion that can be played mindlessly but careful risk analysis, counting of chances helps you win most of the time. A good dice game adaptation of the games above and a lot more developed than the simple dice game adaptation of these games included in the book Dice Games Properly Explained (East-West).

Yes, it's "Battle Line" / "Schottentotten" with dice, but much lighter and simpler than the original.
As a casual dice game for two it excels. (Silly name though - which language is this supposed to be? Certainly not Spanish, where it would be "Los Bandidos").

Essentially a simplified dice version of Battle Line/Schotten-Totten. While that game (one of the all-time great two-player games) isn't threatened by this, it borrows enough that it's still a strong design. The dice, by their nature, make the game less strategic and more swingy. This doesn't matter much, since you can easily play a game in 15 minutes (i.e. shorter than Battle Line). Definitely good, although there's some question about whether one needs to own both this and Battle Line.

As far as a gambling game suitable for the pub goes, this one is number one. Play this for $5/game plus $2/point and use a doubling cube.  Double the stakes anytime... Before, during or after your turn.  Even during an opponents turn.  Once you double, only your opponent can double next.  Fantastic!  Winner is determined by won chips in front of them at time of forfeit.

Schotten Totten meets Shanghaien. I like both games, so I was quite confident I'd like Los Banditos. And I do, although it's the most luck-dependant of the three. It's also lighter and faster as a result.

Nothing new here since we're talking about Battleline redesigned but I like this one much better because I like to throw dice. Also the fact that only four prizes are available at the same time makes the game tighter and a lot more interesting. Simpler to learn but in my opinion more intricate options to take.

Schotten-Totten with dice. Probably a nice variation if you're really into that game, not worth it otherwise. I think both games are OK, but I'm not a big fan of either. Knizia designed much better two-player games with similar complexity and playing time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
typical Knizia--what seems like overly luck-based turns out to be highly controlled/mitigated luck.  Still though, you should probably play best of 3 at least to further mitigate the chance of just outlandishly poor rolls.  It has some agonizingly painful decisions in each game.  Solid and quick!

RATING: 6
Knizia is a master of packing some deep decisions in a very simple game. This has its roots in his other creations such as Battle line, Schotten Totten and Knights of Charlemagne. The idea of limited area control to gain points off a common pool of possibilities. This two player game uses dice placement instead of a hand of cards. Both the pips as well as the color of the dice contributes toward forming the best poker hand for each loot chip. Like many Knizia games, subtle strategies exists beyond the simple rule sets. Players have to decide when to complete or even abandon a hand to get an advantage in either placement of dice or to refresh the pool of dice drawn from the bag. A game of probabilities and a game of chicken. Excellent filler with good replayability!

RATING: 9.5
Battle Line with dice- what more can you ask??  One of the best dice games I own along with Finito and Can't Stop.  Quicker than it's bigger brother, but with more choices- plus the ability to abandon a losing battle and start a new one right away.  I can't quite give it a 10 because I don't like that some columns are worth 3 points while others are only worth 1.  I also prefer the certainty in that every number in every color is at least possibly in the deck versus the variability of the dice rolls.  I also feel the straight is slightly overpowered.

I love the concept of cardline and I like animals so I guess why not start with an eight and go from there.  Might go down...who knows.  I like the idea of three metrics to keep it fresh.

Picked this up for Payton. It's awesome for kids. Just like timeline, but uses animal lengths/weights/lifespan. For what it is(a game for kids) it's great. It also has a good range of enjoyment as, even adults have fun with it. A kids game, that adults actually enjoy.

(KIDS) This is a really cute and simple game.  I enjoy this game with my kids as they don't really need much help (except my 5 year old with understanding the inches to feet comparisons).  I also like that there are 3 different characteristics on the cards to ensure the game gets some replayability.

This is a trivia game about animals (their age, length and weight) which is perfect for younger children who aren’t capable of playing “heavier” animal trivia games like Fauna. You each get a couple of animal cards and need to guess whether it is e.g. heavier than the cards which are already laid out. The first one to get rid of his cards wins (if you guess incorrectly, you draw a new card). You can play guessing either the weight, length or age, the latter being the hardest in my opinion. 

It’s a very quick game as it only lasts for about 10 minutes, but I would rather spend 30 minutes and play Fauna, which is a much better game I think. In Fauna you cannot be unlucky, but in Cardline: Animals you can get some very similar animals and have a much harder time than your opponents. Still, it’s an okay game and one I would assume (and have been told) is great playing with children.

It's not that I love this game and want to play it all the time, but it is phenomenally simple to play while hard to win; it is very accessible to kids (who often know way more about animals than adults); and it's okay to shout with laughter at your own ignorance. An excellent game to bring for kids who may not be gamers yet.

Easy game. You have a hand full of cards with animals on them. They have weights, lengths and lifespans on them. You start with a card in the middle and you try to guess whether the animal in your hand is heavier or longer or older and place them on the table accordingly, depending on the variant you choose. If you're right your card stays on the table. If you are wrong you discard it and draw a new card. It's a neat way to learn about animals.

This is similar to the Timeline series but with standard sized cards. You have the option of sorting the animals by size, weight, or life expectancy. It plays slightly better than Timeline due to the three game choices but mostly gets the big ranking nod due to the larger cards.

Great game for kids and adults to play together. Its like all the other timeline games, you have to put your cards in order based on a certain criteria (life expectancy, size, weight), and many of the cards are pretty close, so when you start getting many cards out in the row it becomes increasingly difficult to get them in the right order.

RATING: 5.5
Rating for both the animals and dinosaurs editions (since we mixed them together): My 6-year-old loves these sets of cards, but mostly just to compare and order them. Easy to travel with, perhaps one day we'll get a game or two in as a family.
Myself I'm disappointed that there are not more statistics on each card. I presume there are some for which the information is not consistently available (already the case on the occasional card). But "Speed" must have been an obvious candidate. A few more cards with missing information would have been acceptable in order to have another stat or two.
An idea for a future edition or promo set is juveniles. I would have loved to have the baby elephant in the mix, for example. Is a baby elephant heavier than a hippo? Than a gorilla? Hrm... So in my imaginary expansion, the company could include only the most interesting ones or ones for which there is sufficient information.
The dinosaurs set also deserves credit for finding a small, visual way of presenting the approximate period in which the animals lived.

This is a great little educational game that has more replayability than its Timeline relatives.  Each of the 100 or so animal cards that come with it have 3 attributes: length of the animal, weight, and average lifespan.  Before a game, one of these attributes is chosen as the one being compared between each animal played.  Each person attempts to play out their hand of cards by correctly guessing where the animal belongs as it compares to cards already out on the table in a line of least to greatest.  The artwork is great.  It's harder than it looks.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2013)

As I really like Timeline, I thought Cardline was going to be a similar hit. So far, it has not been :/. I like that the cards are bigger than in Timeline, but in the copy we played, there were some cards in metres and others in inches, some cards in English, some in French :S. I will unpack my copy soon and see if this is a widespread mistake.

The game is also much more harder than Timeline (not a bad thing), now you can play 3 different categories, if you play with the lifespan or the size category it is very hard because many animals have around the same stats and the gaps between animals are very short. 

For now, I would not say no to a game of Cardline.

Asmodee Customer Service sent me replacement cards, now I have all my Cardline in English, as I use meters and kilos I would love to have that version of the game. It is a good game, the weight and size category are (somewhat) easy as you have the picture of the animals, however the Life Span category is pretty hard. Good game to play with family and new players. 

I like the game and I plan to play this a lot more now, still I prefer to play Timeline.

Picked it up from B&N on clearance and have enjoyed playing it. It's somewhat better than Timeline because each card can be used in one of three ways instead of just one feature. I have noticed that some of the wording is off on the cards though, like one card was called a ferret but was actually what we call a polecat in America, thus our guesses were totally wrong. Still, a good game.

Als es um die Lebenserwartung ging war es gar nicht mehr so leicht, aber auch mit dem Gewicht verschätzt man sich von mal zu mal, ganz abgesehen von einem Riesenmanta, der tatsächlich rießig und auch verdammt schwer ist. Das hätte ich nicht gedacht... Tolles Spiel, für Erwachsene aber wohl mehr noch für Kinder. Gibt's ja aber auch mit etlichen anderen Themen...

A very simple game in that all you need to do is place one of your animal cards in order within a line of cards. The categories are weight, height and life-span so there's challenges for all age groups. The art is beautiful and they've done a great job taking the idea from [gameid=834] which used time but ultimately took the idea from [gameid=917] which used numbers. What I like though is that everyone is playing on the same line, rather than working on an individual one.

With three stats to choose from, cardline games have better variable difficulty than timeline. With animals in particular weight is a lot easier than lifespan, with length in the middle. Nice flexibility for different groups. Also easier to shuffle the big cards.

Great game for kids to learn more about the animal kingdom.  Game is simple enough, pick one of three categories (weight, size, and lifespan) and place the cards in your hand into the row of animal cards on the table...than reveal, by turning your card over, if you are correctly in the right spot.  If so, that's it, if not, draw a card and keep trying!

Another great Timeline game, but this time there are three different games to play. You may choose your game based on guessing an animals length, weight or how long it lives. One creature is placed in the center of the table with it's stats revealed. Everyone in turn will place one of their creatures in relation to the ones currently in play. 

Typical Timeline style of play and loads of fun. Also, if you are a fan of the game Fauna, this is another game that you would be interested in.

Very easy rules which can be explained in a minute make this game an ideal candidate for party game. On the other hand it is good education game, not only for the youngest players. Nevertheless young players are attracted by the theme and high quality card pictures.

It's Timeline clone, although the replayability is a bit raised, as animals can be compared by three features: size, weight and life longevity. It makes them more difficult to remember.

Enjoyable card line series that scales well with different types of difficulty.

RATING: N/A
I like the Timeline series as a whole, where you are putting cards in a long row based on some fact about the illustration on the card, whether it be the date of occurrence, the date of the invention, the size of the animal, and so on. I have no real issue with the "problem" of replayability, i.e., you eventually learn the size of the animal and then the game isn't challenging because you always know where it fits into the lineup. I don't play these very often and don't tend to remember the facts on the back of the cards, and on top of that, learning is not to be avoided, so if you put some random animal facts into your long-term memory for ten bucks while having fun with friends and family…what's the problem exactly?

What a smart little game this is. Love to play it with the kids, although I imagine it would be also quite fun with adults (never tried it that way). So, so nice you can play one of the three individual modes: size, weight and life expectancy (the last one can be quite surprising sometimes!) - adds a lot to the replayability. One of the games that make education fun - you can always have some table talk about animalns while playing it, combining science with pleasure.

A very simple, quick, and educational yet it is still entertaining. Obviously the comparisons to timeline has to be made.  This game gives you three choices of catagory (size, weight and lifespan) so their is a bit more variety.  This subject is a little more interesting than dates for me so it rates a little higher.  Good for a short filler game but if I want the same thematic feel in a little deeper game than I would choose a game like Fauna instead.  As it scratches the same itch.

I really hated the historically themed timeline games -- they feel inaccessible and too much of trivia.  But judging animal masses/lengths/lifespans is something where you can use reason to supplement trivia knowledge, so it is much more appealing to me.

Classic. Great for when we don't feel like strategizing but we don't want a mindless game either. I think there's a couple errors in terms of units of measurement. (One card told me a peacock was only 3.4 inches tall - I'm wondering if they meant feet). Still love this and all the other Timeline games.

One of the animal characteristic games that really works. With only one characteristic being selected for each game it plays very smoothly and simply. We treat each characteristic as a round and play all three as a complete game. In fact it's a shame there's not more than three characteristics. We're very much enjoying it with each round only lasting five minutes it doesn't outstay its welcome. Educational if for no other reason than the imperial to metric conversion - not sure where imperial measurements picked up decimal points, or why some animals are listed over 12 inches still in inches while others are in feet point something, but hey, sure.

This is a straightforward game - try to sort the animals by some attribute (e.g. life span).  If you get lucky, you might get pretty simple cards to place but the game otherwise boils down to educated guessing, more or less.  It's quick and easy to learn and thus a good filler.

Our first Cardline game. Unlike Timeline, which requires at least a rudimentary knowledge or awareness of history, this is totally playable with kids since they are familiar with most/all of the animals and can make relative comparisons between them, at least for size and weight. Playing by life expectancy is a little harder, even for adults.

Will probably play it once or twice a year. More often when grandchildren are older, no doubt. Mediocre card stock quality, but artwork is good and they won't receive much handling.

There's some jankiness to some of the information on these cards and some ambiguity. My kids can play this one but we always play lifespan or weight as length seems really arbitrary. With adults, I'll pull out Timeline over this every time.

Simple game where you guess the weight or size of animals in comparison with one another. More kid-friendly than the regular Timeline series, which is more geared towards adults or older children.

My daughter has loved this game since I bought it.  I will find her looking at the game cards and then she sheepishly looks at me.  I give in to those big brown eyes and ask her if she wants to play and she always gives an emphatic YES!

The game is simple, but there are different ways to play. Basically, you put an animal in the middle of the table and then take the cards from your hand and alternate turns deciding if the category puts them higher or lower to the card in play.  As more cards are played the line of cards grow and the difficulty increases as they become less obvious.  The categories are weight, life span, and size.  

There are always a few "really, I didn't know that" moments and a couple of just missing by an inch or pound.

I wouldn't break it out for my game group, but the family, holiday get together and travel bag are good choices.

A bit less replayability to this than Timeline and not quite as interesting in my opinion.  The length and weight categories are fun to use, but when using the lifespan category, it is often pretty tricky to even make an educated guess about the answer.

Similar to Las Vegas in a lot of respects (right amount of chance, social, not chaotically fast-paced but quick enough that you don't lose interest, simple to understand but complex enough to engage, good fun overall). I was very skeptical about this game but found it to be awesome in the end! At first, it's easy as the diversity of animals is generally great enough to place your card on the table in order (for example: is my one animal, say a horse, bigger or smaller than the other two, say an elephant and a fly, on the board?) but beware, there are always some unexpected surprises (like a 1.5m fish). As more cards are on the table though, the difference between them is smaller and you have to be far more precise in your estimations, leading to a lot of nail-biting and close calls. The cards are cute, the pressure's on, the game is fun, and you get to learn a lot from it. My two complaints would be (1) how re-playable is it? I feel like eventually you would learn to see patterns in the cards and/or remember previous games, to your advantage. With only three variations (weight, height, and age), it may have a limited shelf life (2) that Labradors are not 0.8m long!

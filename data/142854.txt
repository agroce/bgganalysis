Infection is an amazing solo experience. Every time I play I am on the edge, analyzing the board and trying to spend my funds wisely. The theme fits perfectly, and the randomness and variants give the game long-lasting appeal. A few fiddly rules and a slightly long set-up time (by my standards) are the only reasons this is not a 10.

Really great Solitaire game this.  The usual top notch components from Victory Point too.  Like with the States of Siege games there is a dose of luck in the fact you are drawing chits, but this is countered by proper use of the Lab cards and careful selection of which proteins to use.  Really enjoy this.

A well designed solitaire game dripping in theme. Every turn the virus mutates, leaving the player with some difficult choices, with limited resources, to try and eradicate the virus before the death toll rises and humanity is destroyed! Lots of replayability here. Flavor text on the cards ensures that each game generates its own story.

RATING: 10
Extremely random game that plays rather quickly but still requires strategic and tactical decisions (that may be thwarted by the dice/cards). Definitely not a game for people preferring Uwe Rosenberg's approach to gaming, but for people looking for excitement and tension and who are open for bad luck dooming their chances of victory, I consider it a must-have. Equally for anyone loving randomness, for it really has plenty of it.

However, as you may notice, the artwork is somewhat, how to say, mediocre. Personally, it is not my style, but it definitely beats Heidelberger's edition of Flash Point. In other word, the art is okay, but not the best in my eyes.

Component quality is high in my eyes. The thick chips may be a bit of trouble when getting them punched out of the grid, but they are really nice for the random pulling you do in the game.

The decisions need to be well-considered despite the randomness, but they are relatively straight-forward, so that AP or brain burning are not really a problem.

Therefore, it gets my thumbs up also for casual gamers.

A fun game.  I enjoy the tension created with the containment, and lab equipment rolls.  I worry that the game will get a little bit "samey" after a while.  Not "samey" in how the game plays out or what equipment/personnel become available, but "samey" in general strategy and implementation of that strategy.  Time will tell for me.

I looked over the entire VPG catalog to order something new so that I could get the new Dawn of the Zeds map.  This game looked the most appealing of games I do not own (or am awaiting Gold Banner editions), and I am looking forward to trying it.  I like the theme and the spacial elements of the puzzle.  I am also impressed by how responsive the designer is here on BGG.

UPDATE: I have a few plays over a few days under my belt.  This game is really nicely produced, and has a lot of very nice elements.  I like trying to figure out how to maximize the return for completing antibodies by setting things up so that you can clear several molecules at once.  There is a very nice risk/reward calculation that you have to make on whether you should complete an antibody now or risk waiting for a big score.  The equipment and personnel have thematic and useful functions.  The events throw a nice dose of  thematic chaos into the mix.  

All the above is so well done that it pains me a bit that ultimately I don't think I'll be keeping the game.  My issue is with the central driver for the game's tension: the death toll clock.  When that advances 10 steps, you are done, and each advancement is based on a die roll.  If you don't get some fortunate rolls and stop that clock from advancing, there's just no way you can win.  The luck/skill balance is just thrown all out of whack for me, and I think it's due to this single central mechanism.  What I would like to see is the advancement of this game clock more directly tied to how I am doing clearing molecules.  If there were some dynamic that would let me choose to let the game clock run to take the chance of making some big progress later, I would find that more compelling.  As it is, I kinda wish the game would just tell me up front how many turns I was going to have, rather than play for a half hour and realize I never had a prayer.

For me, there is fun luck and bad luck.  I don't mind the luck involved with whether or not I draw the proteins I need.  The game tells me right on the chits how many of each of them there are (a very nice design choice), and I can judge how likely I am to draw what I need.  I also don't mind the events throwing in a monkey wrench then and again.  I really like the virus mutations that can mess you up, because that gives a nice feeling of battling against a continually evolving threat.  I am an immunologist and virologist, and the game gives a nice sense in a very compact time of how this type of research feels over periods of months.  

However, I think just way too much hinges on that death toll clock.  I have no risk/reward choice I can make there, and the result isn't fun for me.  I either roll 6s a few times and can win, or I don't and I have no chance.  I would love to revisit this game if a v2.0 ever comes out that redoes this mechanism.  Like maybe the mutation phase could be redone so that if you pull a molecule and it can't be placed because there is already a molecule there, that would advance the clock or make you roll to advance the clock.  I am thinking something similar to the "Monster surge" mechanism of Arkham Horror.  You would need a much shorter Death Toll Track in this case, but at least the progress of that track would be linked to how well you are controlling the virus.  If you are going to sandbag to try to set up a big removal for maximum funding, possible advancement of the death toll would be a valid consequence.  Decisions to take near term losses for greater long term gains are a realistic element of medical research.  

Or maybe that wouldn't work at all, I'm just spitballin' here.

Easily one of my favorite 'solo only' board games. Relatively quick set up. Decent components, though the cards are cut slightly nonuniformly, which is a pet peeve of mine. Two difficulty settings, easy (bacterial) & hard (viral). Game length and complexity falls between most 'solo only' games like Friday or Sylvion and playing a co-op game like Pandemic solo. 

If you enjoy solo games, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

Solo player game that seems hard to beat. You're fighting off bacteria by working in a lab to take proteins and build molecules that can attack the invading bacteria and hopefully stamp it out. It's a fun game but I'm not a big fan of the cheap Victory Point game box designs or the flimsy puzzle board. The chit components are very nice.

One play and a win on the easy level.

Ok, the hard level is much, much harder.  Money is tight, the antibodies are much harder to complete, and not having that little bit of income at the end of each round hurts!

Another play on Virus level. Death track is frustrating but adds good tension. This is luck done well. A bit fiddly but rating up to an 8 now.

First win on Virus difficulty level.  The molecule mutated just as I was about to win, but a few turns later, I managed to wipe it out.  I am irrationally happy about successfully playing and winning a solitaire game!

RATING: 5
The problem with this game is the mechanism used to determine game length. You may be down to 1 molecule and then 2 status report cards later have 7 on the board. There is only a chance that you may be able to mitigate the status report card draws, and even then the it is only possible to do it 2 times during the whole game assuming both cards are in your card pool and you have the money to buy them. This issue is compounded by the fact that death track comes completely down to a dice roll that is usually modified negatively. Any time you have a virus molecule in the C ring you get a -1 modifier, which is a good deal of the time due to the aforementioned status report cards. Also, the death track section of the status report cards modify your roll negatively more often than not. Again, it may be possible to modify this roll 4 times, but you may not be able to do so. Also, even with the modification it is still a dice roll.

All of this results in a game that has a completely random pace and ending, which I don't think works well for a puzzler. You may be chugging along and have 3 or 4 bad death track rolls in a row and boom, game over. Other games that I solo including Yggdrasil and Robinson Crusoe have mechanisms to completely mitigate the dice which is nice. Even Arkham allows you to mitigate them enough to where it does not become a problem. Contrast this with Pandemic, my favorite game which I would also consider a puzzler. You have a build up of tension as the game goes along. Outbreaks can always be actively mitigated since you know what is in the discard pile and thus likely to come up again after a reshuffle. The other main end game mechanism is the player draw pile, which you can see slowly dwindling as you race for the cure. 

I do like the components and the art. Also the poly bag is nice. Sadly this game has no utility for me. Unlike Forbidden Island, which is another game I am lukewarm on but kept, this won't hit the table since it is a solo only. There are simply too many other games I would rather play when I sit down to solo. I will add that my record is 6-1 (5-1 bacteria (3-0 starting with only 10.00 funding) and 1-0 virus). I only lost my very first game. Even in the virus game there was never really any tension even though I was just 1 death track space from losing. The last 10 or 15 rounds were pretty procedural and it was really just a matter of can I roll good enough during the containment phase to keep the game going long enough to win.

RATING: 6
Nice theming wrt the lab and finding antibodies to virus proteins; a refreshing new system. Overall though I thought it was a little procedural and most of the decisions were obvious from turn to turn. Whereas with Pandemic, which covers a similar theme, there is the approaching sense of doom as the map fills with cubes here you just move up a track numbered 1-10. Perhaps instead of just a simple number the track had tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of deaths it would feel more like a battle to save lives. There is something about the geography of disease spread that is an additonal factor that creates interest in Pandemic. If the mechanic for disease spread here was something other than a simple die roll it might go up a notch or two too. For example, if the various virus molecules each had some property (e.g. increasing/decreasing virulence, or encouraging persistence of other molecules, changing mutation rates...so many possibilities - roll on v2).

My first VPG game. Gameplay offers multiple strategies and seems well balanced. Components, however, are VPG all the way: telescoping corrugated cardboard box, 5-piece puzzle board, uncoated cards, tokens from 3 mm chipboard, and a paper napkin to remove the soot from the laser cutting. Worth it to me for the odd components alone.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2017)

I have never seen the point in playing solo games, I understand why other players play them and I in no way mean to imply anything negative in that activity. If someone enjoys playing solo games that’s great, but to me, boardgames are a social activity. If I’m alone I will rather read a book or play a video game which is how I came to play Infection: Humanity's Last Gasp, I played it on the iPad.

I really like the theme.

The rules are very easy to learn.

The name of the game is great and very evocative, that’s the whole reason I bought the game in the first place.  Obviously I cannot comment on the game´s components, but I can on the gameplay and, so far, I have been disappointed.

I though the game was going to be a challenge but it’s been very easy to beat. There is a caveat on this point though, I have played the scenarios and they are slowly becoming harder to beat so perhaps this issue can disappear but that leads to the next point. The decisions needed to play the game are painfully obvious! At first I thought the iPad implementation wasn’t the whole port of the game, but I watched a play through and they are the same. The game has lots of uncontrollable luck with the randomly drawn proteins, if your draw is lucky you will win easily, if not perhaps you can lose but apart from that there isn’t not a heavy problem to solve. You have some helpers and equipment that cost money but when to use them is also obvious.

Mutations and outbreaks are also bound by random rolls. On that same point, outbreaks doesn’t have an effect on the gameplay, if there is an outbreak nothing happens to you mechanically, it is only a thematic setting unless you do lose the game due to having a high death toll. It seems weird. 

Bottom line, I was expecting a much better game from Infection: Humanity's Last Gasp, but so far it has been a disappointing experience. The decisions are obvious and luck decides too much of the game, you win or lose by how lucky you were on the protein draw, not by how good were your decisions and that’s a huge minus for me. Perhaps I will continue to play the scenarios to see if I’m missing something, besides playing it on the iPad takes very little time. I would never buy or play it in real life, but that’s because I don’t enjoy solo games. I was expecting a much heavier game.

Dirty tokens :) The added napkin was a nice touch and gave me a chuckle.

The tokens are very think and durable. But I was worried about durability of the cards so I sleeved them all.

The game is simple, yet incredible! As I used to be a microbiology major, I can really appreciate the amount of theme put into this game :). I thought that Pandemic had it but but man this game just replaces it for me if I ever wanted to play solitaire game for this kind of theme. Even with two I think that I will play this with a friend! But Pandemic does give a different feel to it... Maybe it is a brand new game appeal that blinding me right now.

Very awesome game - if you are into this kind of theme at all, please do check it out. The puzzle aspect is very strong as well so I think that this one will go well with just about anybody. And the game is so light that I might start carrying this one with me everywhere.

The whole idea of the virus in the petri dish and the location of the molecules in the dish effecting how easy they are to eliminate is brilliant

Wonder if it could be turned into a 2 player game if had 2 copies.  
Yale Lab vs MIT lab.
each player would have a virus to fight with their own set of tokens - however, lab personel and equipment would be from a common pool and would have to be bid for.
Add in the ability to trade antibodies, and items, maybe throw in a couple of screw-u round tokens for messing the other player up e.g., sabotage

Fun mechanics, playable under an hour including set up and take down.

Theme is interesting but feels slightly empty and is unrealistic, with things like 'molecules' and 'proteins' plugged in for theme but without any link to what these things may mean in reality. This criticism is from a biologist and geneticist's perspective, so it may not bother you. This contrasts with Zulus on the Ramparts! and Dawn of the zeds, two other Victory Point games that overflow with theme.

An overall pleasant game which is different enough from everything else to be worth a try.

A nice little puzzle.  Plays quickly and has good theme, doesn't outstay its welcome.  Simple enough rule set to get down. 

There is a lot to like about this game and the staff clashes are entertaining.  Looks very repayable with the chit draw and molecule draw mechanics combined with the event cards and available equipment and scientists for purchase meaning that every game will likely have a very different feel.

An easy 8 once I started playing with the Virus (hard) level.  The bacteria (beginner) level is fine for learning the game but just too easy for repeated play.

App only. Decent diversion, but there's a whole lot of luck here right?  Can't quite figure out how the protein pool works nor the loss of containment or mutations. It's possible that those things can be gamed, but not enough transparency on the app to know if they're truly random or more finite and controllable. Would not buy actual game.

[u]02-Jul-2015[/u]:  Wow, what a great little game!  This game replaces VPG's States of Siege engine, but leaves in place the event deck mechanism, with a wonderful solo puzzle of a game.  The player must create antibodies to fight the every growing...and mutating...virus infecting the world at large.  Using various pieces of lab equipment and garnering the help of some laboratory workers (including Marvin, the rat!), you must study molecules and place them in specific groupings to wipe out each part of the virus.

VPG has done a great production job with Infection.  The board is double-sided to provide two main levels of difficulty.  All of the tokens are their standard thick cardboard of varying shapes and sizes.  There is not a lot of artwork, but the graphic design of the board and pieces are very nice.  The event deck is great as well...but it may not be obvious at first.  The flavor text that is mixed in with the "important" information is well worth examining and helps create the world you are working within.

There is a lot of game provided in a small package.  It's challenging and fun.  A great addition to the collection.

Really fun solo game. As far as VPG's solo games go, this is one of the simplest and most thematic ones in their arsenal. At the same time, it's unfortunately one of the easiest. I like the way you collect and form antibodies to fight strains of the infection, but there's almost no tension to the game. Anyone even slightly experienced with games should start right away with the "hard mode," as the easy mode is more of a tutorial than anything else. Enjoyable, but probably not one that will stick around due to how easy it is.

A very solid solitaire game ...that fits on my gaming board so I can play in bed ...not that I am lazy but suffer from a long term illness which puts me in bed a lot ...

Great the way he has created relations with the medical team or not in some ways as some Drs refusing to work with each other ...mirrors life very well !

Clever puzzle game...that could gave been dry but is not ...

Another great game from VPG I own 12 of their games now in the newish delux format and each one is a master class in great game design and fun ...they are my go to solitaire gaming company ...

Secret One Exchange - See comment attached to "Hostage Negotiator". Also, Pandemic is arguably my favorite game, so the theme lines up with that nicely.

Playtime: ~30-45 minutes including setup and teardown.

Comment: Relatively light on rules and complexity, the game however is a nice short puzzle. You're given a virus in a petri dish that is constantly changing and mutating. You need to finish an antibody quickly before the actual molecule disappears again. Event cards keep the game fresh as well as the random draw of molecules and lab/scientist cards. Some are better than others though. Also, Viral side is the way to play this. Bacterial side is too easy and I almost never lose. With a pinch of luck and some skillful play, Viral side can be beaten ~50% of the time.

Extras: Sleeved in premium mayday sleeves. Need to upgrade to FFG sleeves eventually. Cards don't get handled often, but it makes setup that much quicker.

Optimal Player Count: 1

There is a certain luck of the draw, but I find it increases the level of tension more than the level of frustration.  And the technology and staff can help mitigate the unknowns, as they should.  The elements just click.  And varying start and difficulty levels keep it interesting.  Given to me by John Gibson himself.  Truly enjoyed.

A solo-only board game putting you in charge of researching the cure to a terrible virus.

A fun, quick to set up and play, game. It offers a few decisions on how to best approach taking out the virus as well as what cards to purchase with your limited funds.

I've yet to lose playing on the easier level. The more difficult level is more of a challenge.

The game is puzzle-like, but not to a fault. Some strategic, and even some tactical choices will need to be made. A fun lunchtime game.

I like just about everything about this game. Easy to set up, easy to start playing - but at least during the first games, hard to win. After a certain number of games it is really only lack of luck with the dice that will mean a loss. But it is still fun, has a great theme, nice components and an appealingly short playing time. Great to take our for a nice game from time to time - always very enjoyable.

A great puzzle game that takes foresight in order to beat in the higher difficulty. I find myself generally feeling like I was so close to beating the game, despite the death track being just a die roll with vary few ways to mitigate it. Since I generally feel I was so close with good strategy I feel I can not complain with the way the game balances out.

Doesn't feel like much of a game or much of a puzzle. The mechanisms just feel random rather than randomness based on a risk to reward calculation. So I don't feel the tension. What happens is what happens. You do your best, but the decisions and effects aren't really interesting so much as fatalistic.

So I guess the game/puzzle is trying to tell a story, but even there I'm not feeling it. The human race is on the brink of extinction and you're buying piddling bits of equipment and having staff squabbles in the lab? With a tweak I might suspend belief and swallow some sort of international lab cooperation/competition storyline. But what we have here is a research lab game with a tacked on world viral catastrophe theme - because that's way cooler than just working in a lab, right? Even if I suspend belief it's still just a bit dull without a decent storyline arch. Mutations and outbreaks are these random events that as a lab manager I'm not too fussed about. If the virus spreads to Europe what the hell do I care? Now, if that took out half the staff of the Munich lab that was working on molecule G then that would mean something. But it doesn't do anything like this, so I'm ambivalent about the whole containment storyline. A nice idea, but ultimately meaningless. What a shame.

I'm not really a solo gamer, so a solo game has to be special to get my juices flowing. I think there are better VPG games out there, but this one certainly has potential. It's just not quite there in its current form for me.

I've played this game several times over the last couple of weeks and I have to say it is great.

It flows very well and is very challenging.

I would recommend this highly for a solo gaming fix.

Should be on every gamers table. One of the best solo games available after Space Hulk: Death Angel, on my list, because re-playability is limited (i.e. can't play multiple times in one day without getting bored).
VPG needs to put more effort into marketing this game.

This is one of my favorite Victory Point games so far. A solo joint where you're building sets of molecules to develop a cure for the titular infection, it can get very tough. The devices and characters help even things out a bit, if you manage to deploy then well!

Great low complexity puzzler that plays in half an hour or so. I went for the polybag edition as I intend to bring the game along on travels. The game is very random but I quite like it. It will probably get a decent amount of plays from me over the coming years.

Now that I have a workable scoring system, to ten goes the rating. Now I can lose (and win someday) with different degrees of victory/loss.

Below is what I'm using:

If you didn't cure the virus, subtract :bd6-1: for each remaining card in the status deck
If you did cure the virus, add :d6-1: for each remaining card in the status deck.

Everything below applies to both victory and loss games.

Add :d6-1: point for each dollar of funding.
Add :d6-5: points for each level on the death toll between your marker and the skull.
Add :d6-2: points for each uncured molecule in the vaccine area. (Points for working fast)
Add :d6-1: for each cured molecule in the vaccine area (1 point for each, even if there are multiple molecules of the same letter).
Subtract :bd6-1: point for each protein in the vaccine area (unfinished work is wasteful)

We played this exactly once at a game night, then the husband and I won it in a game swap.  I always like the games that involve keeping your objective secret from the other players.  In this case, since you're trying for three, your objective may be shared with another player.

Reiner Knizia revisits the whole Winner's Circle/Royal Turf mechanics, and comes up with something similar, yet surprisingly different at the same time! Simple, yes, but with a lot of pondering going on as you watch what your opponents are up to. The rats that they have "bets" on are not anywhere near as clear as in Winner's Circle. 
It's a great (but quite light) filler.

first play at game days, would play this one again, eager to see it with children to interact, nicely thought out game that adult gamers and children can play together. The mechanics are clever so an adult or at least an older child who has played it should be there, but this one is light enough to be an interactive good time. Family game night has some new contenders for that coveted table spot!

RATING: 7
Knizia mashes together a couple of mechanisms that I already like, so I was bound to like this game. It has the mechanism from Little Italy where you remove a die after moving the corresponding piece on the board, and it has the hidden goal mechanism you can find in lots of games like Tiki Topple, King Me!, or Heimlich & Co.. I am thoroughly impressed with how tense this game is as the water begins rising, and the rats start getting closer to the top. I find myself begging for a particular roll of the dice to save my preferred rat from getting to the top too quickly. It just works perfectly in creating that stress as you try saving your rats without making it too obvious which ones are yours. They even throw in some bonus cheese tokens to add one more way to rack up some points. The rules are simple, and the components are great.  My one complaint is that it feels like more rats should score.  Stopping while there are still several rats on the ship just feels wrong.  But it's still a quality game that belongs in my collection.

(KIDS) A nice little filler game.  I played with my 3 kids and 1 niece (ages 3, 5, 7, 7) and it went well.  The three year old went along with it though he was not making all the best choices.  I could see playing this as a very fast game with adults too.  Good choices to be made for this kind of game.

After second play, I still have the same feelings in that the game is a fun, fast, push-your-luck kind of filler.  I'm a bit more concerned about how it would work with gamers, but I think it might.  The cheese seemed to impact the outcome a bit much in my games.

Unfair to rate it after one game with 6 but with that many it just seemed way too chaotic, especially as all rats but one died, leaving only the bonus chips to score - bit of an anticlimax. Would try again with 3 or 4.

RATING: 4.5
Ok with kids for some short mouse drowning entertainment.

However, I think that this game would drive me crazy over repetative plays.  

IMHO - I think the "x" dice are broken, and I would likely house rule that out for a game to try and see if it makes a difference.  But logically, the white 11x, would turn any game into a short race of smashing your rats up the ship.  One roll, moves, game over.

This one could use some work...

Provisional rating, might go to a 5 with more players - a soulless filler. There's not much game here, and not much control, and I had to keep looking at my disk to remember which rats I cared about (not a good sign). It's Reiner, so I wasn't expecting a deep theme but the game play isn't exactly engaging either.

I suppose you could try double bluffing to make people believe you wanted different rats, but why bother? Unless there is an even number of backers on each rat, if you're the only one backing one it's doomed.

Would have been better if you bet on the rats secretly and they had different movement and rates of return (but then you'd be playing Royal Turf). 

Overall, not very inspiring. And the theme is going to put some kids off.

RATING: 6
They key element in this game is figuring out what rats others are backing without revealing what you are backing, and without having the rats you back drown or finish first. So hidden information is key.

There was nothing wrong with the game, although rolling an eleven could have an enormous impact, usually giving someone the victory if it happens mid or late game. For whatever reason, playing with four, I never got particularly invested in the outcome. Maybe I didn't feel there was much I could do to win. That the rats with more backers were generally the ones that did best, and if you had any lonely rats defeat was almost certain.

Abandon Ship is a game aimed primarily towards families. Rats are trying to leave the sinking vessel by climbing upwards from the hull towards the deck and possibly safety in the life rafts, and they must do so quickly before the water level becomes so high that they unfortunately do not make it. They are moved by means of dice: players throw a group of dice and then select one rat to be moved. Usually that means that the die with its corresponding colour is removed from the current round so that it remains put for a while. When all dice have been used up, the water level is increased; any rats caught are taken out of the game. In order to make the game interesting, the players get a secret assignment to save a particular trio of rats, giving the game a small psychological angle.

Despite the simplistic nature of Abandon Ship, I found myself liking it. Because of the fact that you need to be careful not to move your rats too greedily, it isn't just dumb dice rolling. Coupled with little bits of cheese which give you bonus points, and the nasty rule that the first rat to make it to the deck gets trampled by the panicking passengers, you get a fun sense of making haste not too slowly. Of course, the beautiful production with its grooved board helps too, although at times it can be a little difficult to move the board pieces with respect to eachother. Not at all too bad.

Quick to set up, explain, and play, this is a good, simple family game.  The moving game board, which simulates the sinking of the ship, is unique and well done.  The components are of good quality too.
This game is excellent for adults to play with younger children.

Very nice filler for lots of people. I love the way this board slide down to sink the ship. It uses dice well. You roll a lot and pick one to play which mitigates the luck a little. You want 3 rats to score and your opponents may share some of your rats. In my game, only one rat was sunk. I'd like to see more sink, but that could be done by changing the starting point. More cut-throat style could also sink more rats.

An OK filler, but even in the filler catgory there's much better.
It looks great, the board is funky and the rats are lumpen. Dice rolling is fun. Selecting a die is fun. Angling to be second, not first is fun.
But the rest is a bit dull and random.
I also dont like it much with more than 5 or so players since the dice will almost always run out with the same player, leaving them with fewer options than the start player for the early part of the game.

I'm surprised at all the negative ratings this game seems to have amassed - I find this to be a trademark Knizia design and a very good family game. While this is a blind race game (you know your rats, you don't know who the others are) there is a clever rule that the first rat to come up to the deck gets trampled upon and doesn't score points. So, there's a lot of possibilities for bluffing and counter bluffing, and it usually isn't obvious until the end, who's rooting for which rat. The game is of course at its best with at least four players, where most of the rats have at least two people behind them.

RATING: 7
Rats are escaping a sinking ship.  Players try to influence each rat's escape, ensuring their three secret colours get off and score points.  Players roll the current pool of dice and select one to action.  This will allow a rat to advance up out of the hold, or fall back down.  When there is only one die left, the ship sinks a little more, possibly eliminating a rat who is caught at the waterline.  Rats that escape will score points, but first rat out is trampled by the passengers!  Feels like a blend of Honeybears and The Great Balloon race, with dice!  Classic Knizia angst... get your rats up for the cheese bonus points, but don't be first out as you'll be trampled.  Okay... just okay.  Lovely bits.

As a game to play with my 6 year old son this hits a really sweet spot.  It's at a level that he can handle and after a few games he's starting to get strategies where you screw your opponent rather than helping yourself if the appropriate opportunity presents itself.  This is good as it means that I'm beginning to be able to play this one properly with him, which means another 'gamers game' (albeit a relatively simple one) that I can play rather than the kids games that I'm usually on the receiving end of.  Plus the board is very neat and evocative of the theme.

Solid dice mechanic makes this one worth a look if you like this type of game. I thought it was reasonably fun, but would rather play Up The River if I am playing with kids (Abandon Ship's dice rules are a little complicated for little ones) and I would rather play Top Secret Spies if I am playing with tweens (as it is a fuller game than Abandon Ship).

This filler/family board game plays in less than 30 minutes.  

This simple little game is visually attractive with a very unique board, great wooden mice, and a handful of colorful dice. It is dice driven, but there is strategy in choosing positioning & movement of the mice.  The more players, the more planning can be sabotaged.  I think that adds to the fun of the game, but I know it bores some, so if more control is desired, then play with fewer.

The theme is tied together very nicely although other themes could be used.  

I'm ready for more plays.

It's just to much of the same thing over and over for me. Roll some dice, move a rat. Roll some more dice and move a rat again. Over and over again.

The sinking ship is a neat idea, but just isn't enough to keep me interested in repeated plays.

RATING: 3
Player has very little control over the outcome.  Outcome is essentially determined randomly based on the three colors you hold.  Huge delay between throws of the dice, and by the time they get to you, you usually can't throw very many.  No point tricking people into which mouse you're controlling because you don't have enough turns to mess around.  All turns must be used to advance your mice such that two cross the finish line, hoping you have more than your opponents (and possibly getting all 3) -- I believe this is the optimal strategy -- yes, being greedy -- boring.

Abandon Ship almost escaped my notice, but I'm glad I was able to trade for a copy. It's a quick, lively, attractive game for families and children.

The basic game concept is similar to Royal Turf (Winner's Circle), but aimed younger. There are eight rats in different colors, trying to escape a sinking ship and maybe grabbing some cheese on the way. You will be rooting for three specific rats, but no one else knows which three they are. On your turn, you roll a pool of dice, choose one die, use it to move one of the rats, then remove that die from the pool. Each die is colored to match one of the rats, but unlike Royal Turf, it's not certain that each of the rats will move once per cycle. Each die has special faces that will allow you to move a rat of [i]any[/i] color, or to move the normal rat [i]but keep its die in the pool[/i]. Once the pool shrinks to a single die, the ship sinks a few spaces (possibly drowning a rat), and the dice pool is fully replenished.

There are some other clever touches. For example, the first rat to escape scores nothing, trampled to death by the rest of the pack. That's a great rule that allows for some subtle bluffing and jockeying.

The game has cheer, it has charm, it has nice components, and some enjoyable bluffing and light tactics. I can't wait to play with my nephews when they're old enough.

It is a Knizia, so I was expecting some interesting, yet agonizing decisions. The beauty is that this filler can handle up to 7 players, taking only 30 minutes. There are seven rats racing upwards on a sinking ship. Each player has a hidden token that tells them what three rats they want to reach the top of the ship to score points. However, the first rat to reach the top deck of the ship gets trampled by the passengers scoring no points. The next three places score 5, 3, and 2 pts respectively. There are 1 or 2 pt "cheese" tokens scattered every so many decks. Whomever has the most points in cheese and points in "placed" rats wins.

There are eight dice--each a matching color of one of the seven rats, and one white die which is sort of a "wild" die--each with various numbers and symbols. Each player, in turn will roll the dice in play, selecting one of the dice to move up or down one of the corresponding rats, removing that die from the dice pool, and then passing the remaining dice to the next player. When only one die is left, the ship "sinks" a random number of decks, drowning any rat if their respective deck hits the water. The interesting twist is that each D6 die has several special symbols that have slightly different effects. One forces a rat to drop back down to the next highest rat. Another allows a player to move any rat X number of decks, regardless of color. Another keeps the die in the dice pool. The white "wild" die that gives more aggressive movement, and so forth.

It is most likely that the secret tokens may have players with overlapping rat preferences, there may be "unspoken" alliances where two or three players have a shared incentive to see a specific rat do well, while sabotaging the progress of other rats. While this is a novel mechanism, I'm thinking the game is far too random in terms of all the dice rolling and deck sinkage, that these shared secret incentives will do any good. With seven players, the result is probably chaotic at best, with lucky rolls and seat positioning to win the game. It's quick enough that another try is in order, and it's light enough to be accessible for the entire family for some hilarious laughs. However, I suspect this isn't going to make it to the table more than a few more times in our group--it had better "click" soon because I don't have patience for this. Initial rating a '6', with room to drop.

Update (02/10/13): It's been a year, and I haven't given this game a second thought. It's a '2'.

a good, light game that balances luck (dice rolls) with strategy. The players picked up the rules in 5 minutes, then the entire table went silent while each player planned their strategy. We enjoyed the fact that each player may or may not be rooting on the same piece.

Fun dicefest.  Each time you roll the colored dice and advance one rat along a track representing a sinking ship.  The die you use is usually set aside.  When there's only one die left, the ship sinks a little (i.e. the track shrinks from behind).  A rat caught by the sinking ship drowns and is removed from play.  Each player has three rats they're trying to get off the ship.  The first rat to escape scores nothing, the second scores 5, the third 3, and the fourth 2.  There are also bonus "cheese" tokens spread along the track that the first player to land gathers.  Much more complicated to explain than to play.

A good bit of family fun. Try to save your rats as the ship sinks by rolling a pool of dice and selecting one action from them. Does require some decision making (move mine forward, move another back?). The way the board slides to show the ship sinking is very nifty!

This is a light family game. You have three rats known only to you that you are trying to save. You roll colored dice to move matching colored rats up the ship so they don't drown. You can also try to collect cheese for some extra points. The first rat does not score points, only the 2nd to 4th rats. When you use a die it is removed for the round. The dice offer some variety such as a wild side, a use but keep in side, and an anchor to slow a rat. There is some light strategy, but it is mainly for laughs.

Didn't expect a whole lot from this. The board is certainly interesting, and the mechanic of sinking the ship is quite creative.

I was pleasantly surprised by the game.  I thought I was through with hidden identity games, but this one goes quickly enough and has a lot of fun in the fistful of dice that you get to roll.  The theme is kind of funny and the sliding water level is a neat gimmick.  It will never be a favorite, or one that we play very often, but for a fun romp every once in a while, this will do nicely.

This Knizia is the one game that could push Can't stop from it's place as "the best push your luck kind of game"- spot.
It's not a 100% push your luck game as Can't stop. Far from it. because of the few points to be won every game remains tense for most of the game.

I rate games on how well it serves it's target audience and the overall "mission" that I feel the game is marketed to. I do this mainly b/c of games like these. I haven't got this many plays out of a dice rolling family game... well, ever. It's fun, easy to explain, can play just as well with 2 as with 7 (how's that for range), fits all ages without there being any unfair advantage due to child versus adult, plays in less than 30 min, and the price point is right seeing as it's usually less than $30. AMAZING.

This game was a good deal at Gencon and we were surprised how much fun we had with it.  The game play reminds me of a horse racing game.  Where you can speed up certain rats or slow down others.  The difference here is rats that aren't fasten up float off to sea.  Each person gets a liferaft with the 3 colors for rats they want to win, but it is kept secret.  Again I enjoy it and really like the board design and its quick to play.

A Reiner Knizia game where rats are trying to flee a ship and you have different color rats you are trying to advance.  There is also some interesting choices you get to make in terms of advancing your rats you care about or hurting opponents rats.

For a light, high luck style game, this is the perfect choice.  This game has the ability to get everyone involved.  I love the scoring mechanic where the first rat to cross the finish line gets trampled, dies, and gets zero points.  My favorite thing to do is to make one of my opponents rats cross the finish line first.  This game is really a blast.

It's Marrakesh (which is fine) with a secret colour mechanism (not so fine). There's a rat in each of 7 colours. You're secretly allocated 3 of them to keep alive, race to the end and score. 3 colours at least keeps you interested longer than the usual 1 colour, so that's an improvement. The dice mechanic works well - roll the die for each surviving rat, pick which one you want to use. Some results kick the die out of the round, so you may want to use something not your colour just to kick it out; some don't kill the die if it's used, some are wild. Anyway, once all but 1 die are kicked out, the race track behind the rats crumbles a semi-random amount, trying to catch the rat in last position and killing if it does (the Marrakesh part). Start a new round with all the remaining rats' dice. While the dice choosing decision provides some interest, it doesn't overcome the secret colour genre's problem in that your result is usually a random reflection of collateral damage. Otherwise it's worth playing if you can bring the fun to the table because it can be hammed up a bit, and if you're looking for something to help fill a 5-7 player mindless 20 minute filler niche.

This is a fun, silly game with a lot of random dice rolls.  Works well at the beginning of a game night as others may join in as the game is being played.  Much more control with fewer players though.  It's always fun to see the water rise in the ship and you hope your rat doesn't get washed away.

Pros:

No amount of strategy can help you.
Based on the colors other players pull can cause you to be the loser before the game even starts.

Overall: Not a fun game, roll and move game with little strategy. At least it plays fast. Too long and too many components to be a quick filler, and not nearly enough strategy to be any sort of feature game.

[color=#CC0000]

This game brought nothing new to our table or presented what it did bring in an engaging way.    I think AEG had a clear shot here, but missed.

The game violates Branham's Razor ("this is me, these are mine") and is, well, about rats.  They're not even particularly cute rats -- they're standard wood cutouts.  Had AEG chosen to spiff them up a bit, named them and made logical groupings for each player's goal card they might have drawn you into the play, offering you a chance to put your heart into the game.  But they chose very sterile packaging instead that I don't think served them well.  In fact the color isn't sufficient enough a differentiator to firmly fix them in your mind -- I found that on each and every turn I had to look at my secret card to remember which rats were mine.

A game with a Teutonic look and feel had better have a cerebral nature to its gameplay or you're left holding an empty bag.  To a large extent I think that's what is here -- a cold game where players don't have significant enough intellectual control or emotional attachment to invest in the game.  

I'd consider recommending this game for kids but Marrakesh implements similar concepts in a much better fashion and provides more satisfying play.  There's less disenfranchisement in Marrakesh as well.  It is both intellectually more challenging and emotionally more engaging than Abandon Ship.

There's a LOT better Knizia to choose from if you want to go down that path -- Ingenious and Amazing Flea Circus are both excellent for kids.  His list of titles for adults is too long to mention here, and there's some real gems on it.

Note -- If you like the dice mechanic on this one consider [b]Little Italy[/b], which implements it in a cleaner, more engaging way.

I'll rate the design a 2 instead of a 3 because Knizia is at a shameless stage of his career where he phones it in and merely reiterates his own designs (when learning this, I knew it was him because of Winner's Circle). More quality over quantity, herr.

Harmless filler. Get the rats you support to the finish, but don't be first. Small rewards (cheese) along the way. Not wanting to be first, and having the straggler get drowned, is a nice touch compared to Winner's Circle.

Knowing all the faces of the dice helps, which is a little out of place in a quick filler where it's better if everybody is on an equal footing.

Overproduced Kniza filler.

Players have three secret colour they are trying to protect and score points with. The colours correspond to 'rats' on a sinking ship. Dice are rolled and rats are moved or bumped back. Typical bluffing game with a dice element. The overproduced element is the board: one part is a ship board that you slide down another board to depict the 'sinking' of the ship.

There are other better (and cheaper) fillers which scratch the same itch. Quicksand and Montgolfier come to mind.

The copy I played had a missing red die. Pretty crucial. Have emailed AEG. No reply thus far.

This is one of those secret identity race type games, sort of like [thing=4636]Clans[/thing] and [thing=6738]Quicksand[/thing], with some cool design bits! The theme is rats escaping from a sinking ship, and the board moves down into water to show the sinking of the boat! It works pretty well, although I don't really love this type of game.

There's a track with 35 or so spaces. 8 (?) rats start on the 10 space. Give each player a random disc, which shows 3 colors (corresponding to rat colors) -- keep secret. 

On your turn, roll all dice in the pool; choose one and move the corresponding rat that many spaces. The dice show a mix of numbers, sometimes with a circle (which may be used on ANY dice, not just the matching die), an anchor (move the rat back to the closest rat behind it) or an arrow (jump ahead to the next highest rat). Some numbers have an 'x' -- those stay in the pool. Otherwise, remove the used die and pass the rest to the next player. 

The round ends when you pass just one die. Then, flip a sinking token: the boat will sink that many spaces: the track moves down that number, or until any rat(s) hit water. If just one, it dies -- remove from game. If more than one, they all survive until all but one are later moved, and that one dies.

Along the way up, several spaces have cheese tokens worth 1 or 2 VP. The first rat to the top is worth 0 VP; then 5, 3, and 2 VP. The game ends when 4 rats have made it to the top. Players score VP for their rats, plus the cheese tokens they've collected ... most VP wins!

Simple and fun, with a couple trademark Knizia twists.  Reminded me somewhat of Heimlich & Co. since you don't want to be too obvious about which rats you're rotting for.

It's more of a children's game than the age range on the box suggests, which really surprises me.  Maybe they meant to put Ages 10- instead of 10+?

Cynical jokes aside, there is nothing wrong with it.  It's a roll and move with some strategic elements.  You get 3 colors of mice on a life preserver that are the mice you want to score points for you at the end of the game.  There are 7 mice in the game.  However, you may or may not have some of the same mice as your opponents, so you never know if moving one mouse is helping just you out or your opponent(s) as well.  Also, the first mouse to reach the top of the ship scores nothing, so you want to be near the top of the pack, but you don't want to get there first.  This added some depth to what would otherwise be a very easy game.

All in all, it's not a horrible waste of time, but it is definitely only recommended for kids.  For the $2 I paid for it, I'll take it.  Had I paid more, I probably would have traded it by now.

Hidden objectives race. Kind of a ratty, dicey version of [gameid=9441], but rather over-produced and with a corresponding price tag. Interesting dice mechanism which is vaguely reminiscent of Royal Turf.

Very enjoyable light, family friendly, fun little game.  It's actually very similar to Royal Turf.  I see no real reason to own both I don't think, and Royal Turf is a little more gamer friendly.  However, this probably has a cooler theme, mechanism, and plays a lot faster than Royal Turf too, so they definitely fill different niche's.  They just scratch the same itch for me.

I'd be happy to play it any time though, just not sure I can devote the shelf space to it though.

It plays a lot quicker than Royal Turf and works better as a family game night game for us for the time being.

Abandon Ship feels like a clean and simple dice mechanism after a year of overcomplicated dice games.  It's easy to explain and moves fast; the giant sinking boat is instantly charming.  There's not much brain wattage required, but Knizia still manages to include some interesting choices.  Production quality is uneven.

We think this is a very creative game - trying to save rats from a sinking ship. The board is great as it sinks as you play. just make sure to have a big table.

RATING: 6
It's a 6 after three plays. I am not sure I'd ever play this with only adults, but with a mix of kids and adults it works well. I love that it plays up to 7(!), the components are great, the theme is fun and there is actually a game here. 

Kids (or grandpa) can just pick the "obvious" best die, but there are subtle choices one can make to put themselves into a better position if you want to be more tactical. Of course, it is a dice game with hidden goals that overlap so all of your clever maneuvering can easily be undone by fate. 

This is very much like King Me with dice. That is why I'd always choose that with a more savvy group of less than 7.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 3.75

This type of game is right up my alley. You roll your dice, you move your mice. Nobody gets hurt. Well, except for the poor rat who made it to the deck first. Oh, and any rats that may have drowned, but besides them, no one.

I like this game mainly for the novelty of the board (the ship sliding in the groove). It's a bit short and "frivolous" for my taste, but I think it has a place in my collection, for now.

Neat components and theme, and the dice  action is Knizia “borrower” via Little Italy,   Entertaining but ultimately ends with a meh feeling and an “ok what other game can we play...”

RATING: 5.5
This was actually pretty clever, and I enjoyed it despite bearing the Knizia name. It's super simple, but I really enjoy the mechanic of being able to move any mouse on the ship, but having a secret objective as to which mouse you want to reach the end of the track. I won by a landslide in our first game, without really putting much thought into it, and without a lot of deception. Still, it was cute and I'd definitely play it again. My only real complaint with the game is the board. The fact that it slides out during the course of the game and gets longer, and longer, is really annoying. The same thing could have easily been accomplished with a little marker that simply said, "This is the furthest point back you may go without drowning." but I guess this all fits into the children's theme. I'd like to see a rethemed version of this where players are running from Zombies! It would be much more cuthroat that way.

Oh Knizia, first you gave us Gold Digger and then this. I love your game design but why must you sully your magnificence with these subpar creations? Abandon ship represents the worse of gaming by melding dice rolls with common pawn movements while trying to achieve overlapping objectives with other players ala King Me! This game is essentially King Me! substituted with dice rolls. Each player wants a subset of mice to arrive on the top of the ship while preventing others from reaching the top. Really a poor design and dice rolls adds to frustration of randomness of movement.Avoid

I've discovered that one can tell a Knizia dice game just from reading the rules of one.  There's always something a little clever, a little mathematical, and a little limiting with his games.  It's almost like being familiar enough with the sound of a particular band that you can identify them on the radio, even when you've never heard that song before.  Abandon Ship is like that, in the way that you remove dice as you roll them, and in the way that you can choose which die to use on a given turn.  I wasn't expecting much from it when I played it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice little game buried beneath the fluff.

The S.S. Nvrsnks is going down, and who is always first off a sinking ship? The rats!

Abandon Ship is a game in which you play to move your group of rats off the ship before the rising water drowns them. The Nvrsnks is also loaded with valuable points-earning cheese, but don’t let desire for that lovely food send your rats to the watery depths. Your opponents may also share some of the rats in your group; they may want to move the rats in a different manner from you. Will their plan send yours into the drink?

Goofy-looking theme, but can be surprisingly strategic and cutthroat. Each player is secretly assigned several rats and must try to maneuver them into scoring position while hopefully keeping opponents' rats from scoring (and possibly even pushing them off the ship!) Lots of fun if everyone is in the right mindset for this type of game.

This is a rethemed version that my friend (locarno) made for us. A great idea for a retheme where the rats become humans fleeing the water and try to out-swim the shark before he EATS them. Makes the game just that much more fun!
